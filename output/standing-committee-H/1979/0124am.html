<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport <span class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 64, in page 4, line 34, leave out from "emergency" to end of line 41 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"either of the following conditions as to length of journey is satisfied in respect of every passenger using the service, namely—
<ol>
<li> the place where he is set down is 30 miles or more, measured in a straight line, from the place where he was taken up; or</li>
<li> some point on the route between those places is 30 miles or more, measured in a straight line, from either of those places;".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this may we take the following amendments:</span></p>
<p>No. 72, in page 4, line 41, leave out "thirty" and insert "fifty".</p>
<p>No. 66, in page 4, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that for the purposes of subparagraph (ii), if the route between the places at which a passenger may be picked up and set down is entirely within fifty miles of either such place, it shall be deemed to be within fifty miles of each of them".</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a technical amendment designed to correct what would otherwise be an anomalous effect in the wording of the Bill.<br><br>
We are concerned with the definition of an express service which, in plain language, is one which travels a distance of at least 30 miles for any passenger. But on reexamining the definition of the journey distance, and the way in which it is measured as drafted in the Bill, it has been noticed that in some circumstances the result could be that the service is an express service when running in one direction, but not when making the return journey.<br><br>
The problem is more easily understood by means of a small diagram, but we do not at present have the concept of visual aids in Standing Committees, so I will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
endeavour to explain the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may care to examine records of the debates on the Dock Work Regulation Act 1976, when a number of his hon. Friends insisted that it was absolutely proper to have visual aids.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think it would be helpful if we returned to clause 3. Discussing what happened on another Bill is out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I submit, Mr. English, that on this Bill it would be of great value to us to have visual aids. A number of maps have been prepared in an attempt to enable myself and a number of organisations to understand the Bill. If the Minister can provide us with a map showing how one can possibly work a service on the basis defined in the Bill, and as it would be defined if the amendment is carried, that would be of considerable assistance.<br><br>
The Minister has now discovered, as others have, that there is an anomaly. There does not appear to be a logical definition of an express carriage service. The definition might be better understood if we had a common visual aid—namely a map.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, first for allowing me to get my breath back after a sprint along the Corridor and secondly for suggesting that we should supply maps and visual aids. I do not think that they will be necessary, but I shall consider the suggestion if, at a later stage, maps or diagrams prove necessary.<br><br>
Express carriages are those used to carry passengers at separate fares, and so on, for less than 30 miles as the crow flies. But the 30 miles as at present defined in the Bill as drafted is the distance from the place where the passengers are picked up. It is possible, therefore, that in one direction the route travelled may, at some point along that route, go more than 30 miles as the crow flies from the point where the passengers were first picked up, although the destination may be less than 30 miles away. Such a journey would be an express carriage. But on the return journey, although exactly the same route is followed, the point that made the outward journey qualify as an express carriage may not be 30 miles from the point at which the return journey commenced—that is, the destin-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0255">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
ation of the outgoing journey. That is plainly anomalous, and it can be corrected by the wording proposed in the Government amendment.<br><br>
In case I have not made the point completely clear I shall give a specific example, with distances. A service takes passengers from A to C, with C being 29 miles from A. The route passes through B, which is 31 miles from A, but only five miles from C. As a result, on the outward journey, all the passengers travel through B. The condition for express services in clause 3(3)(<i>b</i>)(ii) of the Bill is therefore satisfied. However, on the reverse journey from C to A, along precisely the same route, the passengers never travel to any point at least 30 miles from C, which is the pick-up point for the return journey.<br><br>
That is likely to occur only in a very few cases. We are probably dealing only with a tiny number of journeys, but I hope that the Committee will accept that an absurd situation could arise. We therefore propose the revised wording on the amendment paper.<br><br>
The effective change is that the 30 miles is now to be measured from either the place where the passengers are picked up or the place where they are set down. So long as at some point in the journey the route takes the passengers more than 30 miles as the crow flies from either the pick-up point or the set-down point, the service will be an express service.<br><br>
It is important that the definition of express carriage should be intelligible and unlikely to give rise to any anomalous or absurd results, because, as the Bill stands, an express carriage will be taken outside the need for road service licensing. The provider of an express carriage will need an operator's licence. His vehicles will be subject to stringent safety controls, but express carriage services will not need road service licensing and will not therefore be subject to the quantity controls or the power of the traffic commissioners to prevent competition and regulate trade. In discussing later amendments to clause 3, we shall be able to bring out the full significance of that change.<br><br>
Freeing express carriages from the need for road service licensing opens up great opportunities for commuters and other travellers to provide specific services for their needs. They could cater for long-distance commuting in and out of London, for instance. We also expect to see a great
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
opening up of inter-city express services which would provide probably the cheapest form of public transport between large urban centres.<br><br>
We see no reason to inhibit competition in that area or to prevent the setting up of new services. We believe that there is a future for the development of low-cost transport between urban centres, and that many people will be tempted to provide such services, once we have removed the present restrictions on express services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not only the Opposition, but a number of people in the unions and the industry are concerned about competition on the inter-city services, which under this legislation will be outside the control of the traffic commissioners except in the areas where the vehicles start and set down.<br><br>
The Minister says that these will be cheaper services. Cheaper than whom? Presumably the hon. Gentleman means that the services will be cheaper than British Rail's inter-city services. Is that what he has in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The cheapest form of longdistance passenger travel—compared with, among others, British Rail—tends to be the long-distance express coach service. The Greyhound bus in America is the classic example of long-distance cheap travel bringing passenger transport to people who would otherwise not be able to afford to travel about the country on any significant scale.<br><br>
The distances involved in this country are not so great as in America, but there is no doubt that a proper network of express services would be the best low-cost transport system between our main urban centres. We see no need to protect the provision of such services in the same way that stage carriage, for instance, is protected in the Bill. We hope to encourage the provision of more of those services and the opening up of new networks.<br><br>
To get my breath back, I shall not deal at this stage with the Opposition amendments that are grouped with the Government amendments. Their most important point is whether 30 miles is the right distance. I wish to listen to what Labour Members have to say, and I merely point out now that of course there is no right distance when deciding what the minimum passenger journey should be for an express service.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0256">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
We accept the need for a minimum distance, because it is important to make sure that one clearly separates the stage carriage business and express services for most purposes and to reserve to the traffic commissioners, where the county councils prefer it, the right to protect the stage carriage business. We proposed a distance of 25 miles in our consultation paper, but upon reflection and in the light of representations from the industry and elsewhere, we adjusted that to 30 miles. At the moment, we do not see a case for going beyond that. We do not believe that any significant advantage would be gained by stage carriage operators by our doing that.<br><br>
If new arguments are presented, I shall listen to them and perhaps explain in more detail later exactly how we decided on 30 miles as the right minimum journey distance, above which a business becomes that of express carriage and there is no control by traffic commissioners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's desire to catch his breath is convenient. He has referred to the two issues bound up in the group of amendments. The first is whether 30 miles is the correct distance. The Minister says that he wants to hear Opposition arguments about that. Secondly, he has given his justification for a change of wording, to try to make clear the impossibly complex attempt in the Bill to define the length.<br><br>
I agree with the Minister that if we can get clear in our minds how we define the length it may become simpler to deal with the question of the appropriate distance.<br><br>
I am convinced that for the clearest understanding of the argument it would be necessary for us to have a map. Therefore I seek your permission, Mr. English, to distribute maps around the Committee. The Government have not provided one, but the Opposition can. It would cover the precise point about how distance—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is possible to have exhibits in Committee, provided that they will translate—so to speak—into the <i>Official Report.</i> In other words, one cannot have an exhibit that cannot be put into a speech—that is, it cannot be recorded or taken down in shorthand and printed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect Mr. English, I must ask how it was possible in a previous
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
Committee on which I served for the Government to respond to the Opposition's request for exhibits by providing a whole series of maps to show the definition of dock work regulation areas. Those maps were made available to all members of the Committee. I am asking for a much simpler provision, namely that I should be able to circularise a small map. I am prepared to reduce its size to one which could appear in the <i>Official Report,</i> but that will take some time. The map will deal only with the issue of how one defines the distance to be covered by an express vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would help if the Chairman, too, had a copy. If the right hon. Gentleman thinks that he can describe the map in his speech, I shall allow him to use it. Frankly, I do not think he can.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. As this is a matter of some importance, and one of general significance, may I say that I recall an earlier Committee when maps were used extensively and where it was impossible for them to be described in hon. Members' speeches. I am thinking, in particular, of the Committee on Local Government Act 1972, when it would have been impossible to discuss the subject without the use of extensive maps.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is simply out of order to discuss the rulings of other Chairmen in other Committees. I have available the text of the standing ruling on this subject, and I have just given that ruling. Whether someone else did something else in another Committee is quite irrelevant. The situation is as I have described it. Because our proceedings are recorded verbatim, it must be possible for someone reading the <i>Official Report</i> to know what we are talking about. If the right hon. Gentleman were to describe every word and detail on the map, it would be possible to put the exhibit, as it were, into the <i>Official Report.</i> Frankly, I do not think that he can do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. I do not have the advantage which you and the right hon. Gentleman have of having seen the item in question, but I am puzzled by the reference to the map. I understand that the debate on the amendment relates to a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0257">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
conceptual problem of distances and the way in which the distance is divided, and so on. I assume that the document is not a map in the sense that it shows the positions in a particular location on the map; rather, it is a diagram designed to illustrate the concepts involved. If that is right, it is surprising that the right hon. Gentleman is incapable of describing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) would do better to forget his map and describe what he wants to convey in his speech in terms of Lancashire—a perfectly respectable area which anyone can look up in an atlas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall, as always, comply with your ruling, Mr. English. To take Lancashire as an example for the purpose of the conceptual problem raised by the Bill would have been easier if we had not had a local government reform Bill, which changed the boundaries of Lancashire. But I shall do my best.<br><br>
With the present wording of the Bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary fairly said, it is possible that a regular service between two points—let us call them A and B— may in one direction be a local or stage service, and in the other direction may be an express service. In one direction it could be subject to a form of licensing, and in the other direction it could be free from that licensing requirement.<br><br>
I think that all members of the Committee, including the Minister—judging from what he has said—will agree that it would be illogical to have such a definition in the Bill. I am prepared to grant that it was not the Government's intention, and that it was really a drafting difficulty—not by any means the only drafting difficulty in the Bill.<br><br>
The case is best illustrated by taking a diagram of part of our country and giving specific examples. I am one of those hon. Members who, by virtue of the local government reform Act, have been transferred from Lancashire to Cumbria. I therefore choose an example which covers Lancashire as it was before the Act and part of Lancashire as it is under present local government legislation.<br><br>
I want to deal with a non-stop express service from Runcorn to Lancaster. The obvious route for such a service is to travel north from Runcorn and pick up the M62
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
at junction 7. A constituent of one of the members of the Committee may wish to join an express service at Bebington.<br><br>
From junction 7, the express bus could follow the motorway east to junction 10 where it joins the M6 and then go north on the M6 to the Lancaster access road at junction 34, which is 51 miles from Runcorn. I shall use 50 miles rather than 30. It does not change the principle much, and I shall argue later that 50 miles should be the minimum distance.<br><br>
The bus, when it got to junction 34, would be 51 miles from its starting point, but it then doubles back to Lancaster, and goes back within the 50 mile limit. Therefore, if we specified 50 miles, such a service would not be an express service, but the route would have exceeded the 50 mile limit at one point and, on the basis of the present drafting of the Bill, it would be an express service.<br><br>
However, the return journey, from Lancaster to Runcorn, goes a mile or so from Lancaster to junction 34, clearly remaining within a 50 mile radius of Lancaster, and proceeds on the reverse route to Runcorn, which is within 50 miles of Lancaster. At no time on the return journey is the vehicle outside the 50 mile radius. Clearly that is anomalous.<br><br>
Our amendments seek to ensure that both outward and return journeys, within the mileage we agree on, would be local services, and therefore subject to the licensing provisions for the local or stage services. That is the logical way to proceed. If we are to have a definition of express services based on a distance, I hope that it will be accepted that that can be sensibly done only by taking the actual distance as the crow flies between the points of picking up and setting down. That is by far the simplest part of the argument.<br><br>
I now come to the much more difficult question of overlapping picking-up and setting-down points. In the Bill, the distance is defined as from where the passenger is picked up to where he is set down, and it does not deal solely with the distance over which the service operates. The service could operate over 100 or 200 miles and have a number of stopping points at distances much less than that required for the service to qualify as express. Provided that no passenger alighted from the bus at a point less than 50 or 30 miles as the crow flies, according to which definition we decide upon, from where he got on, the express service
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
concept in the Bill would cover that.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister accepts my example as a fair one. Clearly, there are many others. Can he tell us whether, in reconsidering the definition, he is satisfied that it can apply on the basis contained in the Bill which, I understand, is that the distance in question is the distance covered by any one passenger on the bus and not the total route mileage of the bus? Is he satisfied that if the Bill finally emerges in that form there will not be further difficulties of definition?<br><br>
Clearly, it would be simple to define the express service merely in terms of the points at which it stops, but the Minister presumably seeks a more complex definition—I do not argue that because it is more complex it is therefore wrong— which depends upon where passengers get on and off, rather than on the points at which the bus stops. Rather than going on to argue about whether the distance should be 30 miles or 50 miles, I think that it would be helpful if the Minister would now tell us how he has considered this point in the light of the definition that he now seeks to include.<br><br>
Working on the basis of the distance as the crow flies from where the passenger gets on to where he gets off—irrespective of how the bus proceeds between those points, as opposed to how it proceeds between the starting and finishing points of its total journey—will it be possible within the Minister's wording to avoid the difficulty created by the original wording of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The most straightforward answer that I can give to the right hon. Gentleman's question is that the definition that we have chosen depends upon the minimum journey that a passenger can make. It does not mean that in each case there will be problems about what the passengers actually do. It is not a matter of whether they actually get off the bus if there are more frequent stops. It is whether the service is so organised that no passenger can get off less than 30 miles from the picking up point at which he got on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is most helpful. We shall re-read the definition in the light of the Minister's explanation. He now says that the definition is intended to provide that, except in case of emergency when the bus has to stop, it will not be possible for a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
passenger to get off the bus less than 30 miles from the point at which he got on. Therefore, in theory, on a 300 mile route stops would have to be at intervals of no less than 30 miles, measured from point to point as the crow flies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that 300 mile journey there may be stretches where the stops are less than 30 miles apart. I will give further thought to this during the course of the debate and deal with it again when I wind up if further thoughts occur to me, but for the moment I would say that if the service has physical stops for the vehicle which are less than 30 miles apart, so long as the service is so organised that no passenger is allowed to make a journey of less than 30 miles, in other words, if the company organises the service in such a way that it does not pick up and set down any passenger at less than a 30 mile interval, in my opinion that would still be an express service.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a point of crucial importance. It is much easier to check whether a service is within the definition if to transgress the limits is physically impossible—that is, when the bus company advertisements state where the bus will stop for passengers and none of those points is less than 30 or 50 miles, as the crow flies, from another.<br><br>
My question, which the Minister now clearly appreciates, is whether within his definition there could be stops at much more frequent intervals, provided that the company laid down the condition that no passenger could make a journey that carried him less than 30 miles as the crow flies. The point is crucial. Further debate on the subject will not be helpful while that is in doubt, because it will make a big difference in determining the appropriate overall distance.<br><br>
I must press the Minister to explain what the definition in Government amendment No. 64 means. Is it intended to mean that the stops will be 30 miles apart, or that there can be stops more frequently than that, provided that passengers cover a sufficient number of stops and that no passenger travels less than 30 miles as the crow flies from the point at which he gets on to the point at which he gets off?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a new point. The Bill makes the position clear,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0259">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
and my amendment does not change it. The amendment merely changes the points from which the 30 miles is measured. It ensures that the measurement is taken either from the picking-up point or the setting-down point. Otherwise the definition, which is quite plain in the Bill, has not been altered at all. However, I am happy to clarify the right hon. Gentleman's understanding of it.<br><br>
The test that we have chosen relates to passenger journeys. Subsection (3) provides that all passengers have to pass through a point on their route that is at least 30 miles as the crow flies from either the taking-up point or the setting-down point. So long as the service is organised in such a way that no passenger may alight from the bus without taking at least a 30-mile journey under that definition, it is an express carriage service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To generalise from the particular, when I was a lad I lived in a village six or seven miles outside York. The village was, and indeed still is, well served by buses, including an "express service" from York to Hull. When I was at school there was a non-stop bus from York to Hull which ran at a very convenient time if we had missed other buses.<br><br>
Our technique was to climb aboard like normal human beings, and then when the bus reached the point seven miles outside York where we wanted to get off, to ring the bell. In his obliging way the driver mouthing oaths, would eventually come round and unlock the doors and let us off. At the time that did not have any consequences. The expression "express coach" was simply one used in the trade.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us whether a driver who obliged in that way would transform the York-Hull express service into a stage carriage service? It seems that if this were done, as we did it for a year or two, on a regular basis, the service would be transformed. That is one of the practicalities of the matter which have not been thought out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would depend on how the service was organised, not on the undisciplined behaviour of the passengers. I do not know what happened on other buses in the neighbourhood of York and Hull when the hon. Gentleman was at school, but it is arguable that there could be a stage carriage service the passengers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
on which insisted, for some bizarre reason, on being set down at a place other than an authorised stop. They may have clamoured to get out of the vehicle at a point where, according to the traffic commissioners' conditions and so forth, the bus was not meant to stop for setting down passengers. The fact that an occasional driver was bullied into doing that would not stop that being a stage carriage service.<br><br>
In the real world what matters is how the service is organised. In order for an operator to organise an express carriage to get himself outside road service licensing he will have to organise his service, subject to emergencies and passengers behaving in an utterly unpredictable way and forcing his drivers to do something exceptional, so that in all ordinary circumstances no passenger can get off unless he has travelled at least 30 miles, as the crow flies, from the beginning of his journey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's second explanation is different from his first and I believe that it is more likely to be the correct interpretation of the Government's amendment. At the end of his second explanation he pointed to the fact that at some point on the route each passenger will need to have travelled at least 30 miles. That is different from saying that no passenger can get off the bus within less than 30 miles, as the crow flies, from the point at which he got on. There is a difference that is essential to the argument about the definition. That must be so even on the basis of the argument advanced by the Minister for his first amendment—the argument about the bus that could be express one way and not the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not new. The right hon. Gentleman's example of Lancaster to Runcorn is an exact example, although he was using a different distance, of where at some point on the route all the passengers have gone above the qualifying distance. The whole point of the Government amendment is how we are to calculate that. So long as each passenger at some point on the route has travelled more than 30 miles from his picking-up point to his setting-down point and cannot get off until he has travelled at least 30 miles as the crow flies from one point to the other it is an express service.<br><br>
Perhaps I have not given the best example. It is quite common with an express service, and we contemplate that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
it will remain the case, that a long-distance service will have several picking-up points in the city whence it departs and several in the city at which it arrives.<br><br>
I take the example of Lancaster to Runcorn—I do not know that particular service, but I believe that it is safe to say that a distance of some 50 miles is involved. Let us assume that there are three or four stops in Lancaster at which the service picks up passengers as it passes through the suburbs, and three or four stops on the way into Runcorn. It will be an express service so long as it is so organised that passengers getting on in Lancaster can get off only when they arrive at Runcorn. The fact that any two individual stops are less than 30 miles apart does not matter. The minimum journey that a passenger may take on a service is what will determine whether or not that is an express carriage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are getting the position stated much more clearly, but it is rather naive for the Parliamentary Secretary to suggest that the point was clear in the original argument. I made clear to the Committee that I was talking about the simpler example of the express journey that goes from point A to point B and the argument—</span></p>
<p>11.8 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman's</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>attention having been called to the fact that six Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and eight Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></span></p>
<p>11.10 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by the flurry of Government Members arriving to assist me in maintaining a quorum, I think that the Minister is being a little naive in suggesting that the argument that I first advanced in favour of changing the definition in the Bill covered the case for a number of stops between Lancaster and Runcorn or between any places outside or within the limit of the Bill. I think that that adds a complication.<br><br>
As we now understand the Government amendment, it would permit someone to get on an express bus and get off at a point less than 30 miles away without that ceasing to be an express service—that much is clear—providing that the journey that the passenger had made had exceeded
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
the 30-mile limit. That is agreed on the Minister's own definition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exceeded the limit at some point on the route.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has corrected himself. At some point before the passenger gets off he must be 30 miles as the crow flies from wherever he got on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that is not a distinction without difference. I do not think that it is logically possible to travel a distance of more than 30 miles from A to B when they are less than 30 miles apart.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a very bendy road—a mountain track type road, for example— the total journey from A to B might be 50 miles, but no individual point would be more than 30 miles from either A or B.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully accept the Minister's correction. He makes an important point. Of course it is possible. Therefore we are now discussing a definition that would allow two situations to be covered. I shall stay with 30 miles for the purpose of this argument because it is the distance used in the Government amendment. As the Parliamentary Secretary said, the route could have umpteen hairpin bends in it, running from the top to the bottom of a mountain but the distance as the crow flies between the points at which the passenger gets on and off could be less than 30 miles. The second situation is the Runcorn to Lancaster example, where the bus travels more than 30 miles in returning to a point, which is less than 30 miles from the original point, to drop the passenger. An express service must have setting down points that ensure that no passenger could cause the service not to be an express bus service.<br><br>
I turn now to the more complex issue— the type of route that the Minister mentioned in his second explanation. On such a route there would be a number of stopping points which were less than 30 miles apart as the crow flies or even less than 30 miles apart when measuring the distance the bus travels.<br><br>
The Minister said that his definition would not necessarily ensure that the bus operating on the route was not an express
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0261">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
bus. The bus could still operate an express service over the route with all those stopping points, providing it had some condition attached to the fare that although the bus could stop, the passenger would not be allowed off. He would have to remain on the bus until it had travelled 30 miles or until he was 30 miles as the crow flies from the point at which he had got on. As long as he satisfied either condition the bus would still be operating an express service.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
That brings us to the contentious and difficult question of whether 30 miles or 50 miles is the right distance for this purpose. Clearly it would be a different situation if we had a much more straightforward definition—no stopping, or stops only at the distances prescribed. In those circumstances, fewer difficulties would be raised by the 30 miles.<br><br>
However, let us assume that the Government's amendment is carried and the definition of "distance" is 30 miles, measured in the way that the Parliamentary Secretary has made clear it should be, and let us also assume that some operators will want, perfectly legally if the Bill goes through with the Government amendment, to operate express services that can have many more stops than would be possible if there had to be the 30 miles measured between the stops by either of the methods mentioned. There could be running through many areas of the country buses which frequently picked up and put down people and would, under the Government's definition, be express buses.<br><br>
If that happened, it would become impossible for any county or metropolitan authority trying to work out a sensible transport system to know what sort of cover would be provided by those services over which they had a direct influence—I put it no higher—by virtue of negotiating with the bus operators within their own authority areas about what services should be provided.<br><br>
That definition of express service raises the difficult question whether bus companies would be prepared, in negotiation with the county or metropolitan authority, to discuss the income that they were receiving from their express services. At present, they discuss their total income
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
from that part of the bus network which is—</span></p>

<p>11.19 a.m.</p>
<p><i>On resuming</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It becomes a little difficult to discuss a group of amendments which contains two principles which have to be coupled for a proper understanding of this part of the Bill if the Government do not maintain their quorum and therefore permit an uninterrupted exposition of the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would probably facilitate the task of the Government Whip if the right hon. Gentleman tried to hold his audience when moving his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have discussed my amendments with what I hope is only a part of my audience, if the Parliamentary Secretary will allow me to be so presumptuous. I assume that he and his hon. Friends are part of the audience of any serious argument addressed to the rather difficult question of how we should define express carriage and what the distance should be if we are to include it in the definition.<br><br>
At present, when the county or metropolitan authorities discuss with bus operators what networks should be covered and what income of the bus companies should be provided for covering those parts of the network which cannot sustain themselves from fares and need a degree of financial support, the bus companies are normally prepared to give information about all the fares that they take when travelling through a particular local authority area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been very lenient with the right hon. Gentleman. I was born at a point on his invisible map and I cannot see why anyone should wish to leave Lancashire in order to journey to Cheshire, but we are discussing a simple amendment and the right hon. Gentleman is making rather heavy weather of it. We are certainly not going into the question of fares and the income of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0262">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
companies at this stage. We are discussing a group of amendments that relate purely to distance, mileage and the definition of an express carriage. I should be glad if the right hon. Gentleman would address himself to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My argument relates specifically to the two issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman thinks that he is on clause stand part. He is not; he is speaking to an amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, Mr. English. I am trying to discuss a group of amendments containing related principles which, put together, affect the ability of those who negotiate network arrangements with bus companies to do their job. To debate the amendments as if they had no bearing on that matter would be very artificial. I am sure, that you, Mr. English, do not wish to create an artificial situation.<br><br>
Express services, as controlled by the present law, are part of the total fares arrangement which is taken into account in negotiations. As they will be defined if the Government's amendment is carried, express services will cease to form part of that arrangement. I submit that, on that narrow basis, the distance or the definition affects the network structure. May I discuss it purely within that limited framework?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of the three amendments we are discussing, one simply alters the definition by replacing part of the clause with the words on the amendment paper, another alters it by changing "thirty" to "fifty" and the third picks up the point that the right hon. Gentleman has already discussed at some length—namely, how the distance is to be measured. That is all we are discussing now. At some other stage we may discuss other matters. At the moment we are discussing only the definition. This is a very restricted debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very well, Mr. English. I shall keep very much to the terms of the definition. However, the definition can make a crucial difference to the way in which express carriage, as opposed to stage carriage, is operated in this country.<br><br>
If an express service were defined as one in which there had to be a certain distance between the points at which passengers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
were picked up and set down, that would enable one type of service to be operated. But the definition proposed here enables the vehicle to stop at an infinite number of places, provided that the points at which any passenger gets on and off are at a certain distance. I shall not go through the two definitions. That is a different type of service.<br><br>
I maintain that, given the other qualifications in the Bill about traffic commissioners being involved or not, in the one instance the traffic commissioner has a specific duty to have regard to the services and, in the other, he is prevented from commenting in any way. He is required only to be informed. Therefore, the definition has that effect, too.<br><br>
The definition affects the way in which the companies organise their networks. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary wants local authorities which are transport planning authorities to make intelligent arrangements for the provision of network services within their areas. It would be easier to make an intelligent arrangement if the Bill made clear beyond a peradventure how the express services as defined were to fit into a network arrangement negotiated by a local authority responsible for transport plans in its area and, within the definition, we should have express services making an infinite variety of stops. I leave aside at this stage the question of how the services are to be financed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks generally to amendment No. 72. As the Parliamentary Secretary said, one could think of any number of miles, and any number of miles could be right. But there are other considerations to be taken into account when we talk about the difference between 50 and 30 miles. One of those considerations is the effect on existing operators.<br><br>
Concern has been expressed, particularly on Second Reading, about cross-subsidisation. The word has been used ad nauseam. If the distance is to be 30 miles, the National Bus Company and other companies will inevitably lose a large part of their revenue. Following the formula down, there will then be that much less money for cross-subsidisation.<br><br>
Many rural lines could face the following consequences. First, they might have to close down because cross-subsidisation by the National Bus Company had ceased as a result of the loss of revenue between the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0263">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
30 and the 50 miles. I think that about £5½ million would be available to operators who moved in and creamed off lucrative lines operated by the National Bus Company.<br><br>
Secondly, there is provision for local government to subsidise a rural line. That is done in many instances. But most rural lines are subsidised not just by local government, but by local government and the National Bus Company together.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
If that area is creamed off, as inevitably it will be, and the amount of money available is less, the county council or district council will have contributed a greater proportion to maintain that rural line, in order to make up for what the National Bus Company was no longer able to contribute. Given the effect on local authorities of the Government's public expenditure cuts, the money would not be available and numerous rural lines might therefore be closed down for lack of finance.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary may say that I am going beyond the realms of possibility because that will not happen, but he has introduced the Bill, and has made plain that the idea behind it is to get more people to operate a service. If he gets more people to operate a service, business must be taken from somewhere else, which can only mean from the National Bus Company, because the number of people travelling on bus services has decreased. That is the intention of the Bill, as the Minister knows. The Minister is providing competition by introducing this unlicensed system.<br><br>
Our argument, therefore—and I hope that this will be dealt with constructively, because it is a fact of life—is that 50 miles would be a more realistic figure than 30 miles, because between those two limits about £5½ million worth of business could be lost by the National Bus Company. As a considerable amount of that sum is used in cross-subsidisation, if the limit is not increased to 50 miles, the Minister could find himself in effect responsible, even though it was not his intention, for the closure of many desirable rural services. As car-sharing may take passengers from rural services in any event, it is crucial that the limit be increased so that money remains available for subsidising rural services.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
If the Minister does not wish to create such a situation—and I am sure that he has discussed the matter with the National Bus Company—he must explain why the limit is set at 30 miles rather than 50 miles, because it is certainly a distinct possibility that money available for cross-subsidisation will be lost if it remains at 30 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was clear from the Parliamentary Secretary's introduction that, once again, he had realised that he wished to tighten the provisions of the Bill, which is one of the purposes of the Committee stage, to make clear that one of the controls on express services will be the condition that no one shall be picked up and carried on the service unless his journey is more than 30 miles. That provision therefore introduces almost a key control on express services, bearing in mind that such services have basically been covered by permission granted by the traffic commissioners for the provision of an extra service.<br><br>
We are aware from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, but also from interests that have given the Minister their views on his proposals, that the original proposal was a limit of 25 miles. I heard that at one stage 20 miles was proposed, but that is not relevant now. The Minister wants a 30 mile limit and the same interests argue that it should be 50 miles.<br><br>
That interest is reflected to a certain extent in our amendment. We may well attract the charge that yet again we are reflecting the vested interests of industry. If that is so, it is interesting to note that the National Bus Company's proposed amendment relating to the Minister's provisions outlines the concern that he has reflected in his own amendment, so perhaps he is now taking account of National Bus Company interests. However, we are not accusing him of that. The point is whether the clause actually does what is intended. If it does not, we shall seek to change it.<br><br>
I do not know whether the clause solves the problem that concerns us, bearing in mind that we are basically against the taking away of controls on the express services, for many of the reasons given by my hon. Friend, chiefly that it will undermine other services. The relevance of the debate on the argument about cross-subsidisation can be taken on clause stand part, as you reminded us, Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0264">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
English.<br><br>
The narrow aim of the Government amendment is solely to make clear that anyone travelling on an express bus shall travel at least 30 miles, as the crow flies, even though the express service may have a number of stops, within 30 miles of the picking-up point. The operating factor is how far the passenger travels on an express service.<br><br>
Our argument, shown in other amendments grouped with the Government amendment, is that we feel that consideration should be given to 50 miles. It may be argued that we should go further than 50 miles. We suggested that to National Bus Company when it requested that we should consider an amendment moving to 50 miles. It does not seem too keen on that idea, and there is a major difference of view between me and the company, which seems to be saying "We do not want competition within 50 miles but we are quite happy to have it after 50, competing with another nationalised industry, British Rail, on those services." It is clear that the NBC is looking after its own interests and we should not forget that those interests are not necessarily the same as those that we are trying to reflect.<br><br>
Sometimes, however, those interests coincide, and our amendment argues that 30 miles is too little to achieve a sufficient precaution. We are talking about the area over which the commissioner has control. We know that there are definitions of what a fare stage may be, and previous legislation was concerned with whether a 21p fare would be a means of giving some indication of where an express service should operate from. The Minister is making clear that the definition is determined not by a fare, but by mileage, which seems to make more sense in that it is easier to define, although there are difficulties, as he said. We are now down to as the crow flies, rather than where the bus goes.<br><br>
For good reason, the Minister makes clear in his amendments that there are certain routes in fare stages that are greater than 30 miles, and therefore conditions other than mileage must apply. He gave the example of the route across a mountain which might be 50 miles, but the important factor is that the distance from the picking up point to the setting down point should be 30 miles. That is the requirement for anyone using an express service.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
We shall discuss the consequences of that development in the clause stand part debate—although the Minister has already indicated his thinking on it in mentioning Greyhound buses, the successful symbol of the American transportation system. An American research assistant who is working with me told me of some of the consequences of that sort of thinking on the American system. No doubt we shall consider that in our debate on later stages of the Bill.<br><br>
It is a matter of contention, and an influencing factor in our thinking, as to whether we should change the figure from 30 to 50 miles as proposed in our amendment. We feel that one cannot ignore the economic consequences of whether it is 20 or 50 miles. It is not solely a problem of how one can enforce a 30 mile limit— I shall come to that point in a moment, because it is a major problem—but also one of economic consequences.<br><br>
It will be useful to have an indication of the considerations the Minister had in mind when the Government changed from the 25 miles in consultative document to 30 miles. We feel strongly about the competitive aspects on existing public transport systems which are maintained by the State in a very expensive way. I hasten to add, however, that it is a less expensive way than is done in Europe, or in those mass transit systems that the Minister himself, on the occasions that he is with us—our part-time Minister— tells us about, in San Francisco, or where-ever it might be, as good examples. But perhaps he should also tell us of the subsidies involved.<br><br>
We are extremely concerned about the economic implications. We ask the Minister to give us an indication of the Government's thinking in changing from 25 to 30 miles. This is a strong economic point which is relevant to later stages in the Bill. We can then take that thinking into account when dealing with these systems. Whether we decide on 30 miles or 50 miles will affect how we decide the allocation of subsidies, under the present policies of Labour and Conservative Governments towards transport supplementary grants. How we determine subsidised services will be governed by whether there are more services doing 30 miles or less doing 50 miles.<br><br>
If our amendment proposing 50 miles were accepted, the express services would have less flexibility in competing. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0265">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
Government feel that competition is the main purpose of the Bill. They want to introduce it and reduce the effect of regulations on the provision of transport systems. The difference between us is that we disagree about the consequences, and about whether the Governments' proposals are to the betterment of the transport system and its users.<br><br>
If the Government's proposal of 30 miles were accepted, we should make the 30-mile limit almost the only condition of control, to be taken with subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) and the other factors about being set down within points, or about notice being given to the commission in a prescribed form. Previously we agreed that the control would be by the commission. Now the traffic commissioners will only receive notice of an express service and have control over the set down or pick up points within the fare-stage areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put to my hon. Friend that from the way in which the definition is drafted the commissioner cannot do that. Has my hon. Friend considered that the commissioner may receive a notification from a bus company stating that it is to run an express service through the commissioner's area, having stops at every mile along the way, but will not allow any passengers to alight until they have covered 30 miles? In that case, does my hon. Friend consider that the commissioner would in any way be able to question that? The bus operator would be able to say, "I am complying with conditions of express carriage. All I must do is notify you. I do not have to discuss it with you because you have no control over it."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a fundamental issue on the pick-up and set-down points, whether they are further apart or nearer, and how one defines the 30 miles or 50 miles.<br><br>
But I am coming to the point about how that is enforced. In other words, making the limit 30 miles or 50 may be academic if the restriction is not enforceable. There would not be much point in having any form of control over this system. Let us do away with arguments about 30 miles and 50 miles and simply say that there shall be express services that can do as they will.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
The Government are aware that they wish to have some limitations, particularly in the areas of fare stages. The difficulty with express services is that they are presumed to be linking two urban areas or two areas where passengers will seek to get on to express services. By the definition in the Bill, those will inevitably be areas controlled by the commissioners, who can determine where the stops shall be and where one can get on or get off those services. With the amendment, the Minister is saying that wherever one gets on or gets off must not be less than 30 miles.<br><br>
From the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), I assume that the traffic commissioners can only receive the notice of the express services. Perhaps the Minister can tell the Committee where the 30 miles for pick-up points for the express service may start and finish, but the traffic commissioners may influence where those stops shall be. I have some doubt about that matter because the Bill does not make it clear. The traffic commissioners can control it in a fare stage situation—they have control of routes and such situations —but, presumably, an express service will want to pick up passengers at the most popular points where most stops are located, and all members of the Committee will know where these are located in their constituencies. Who will be able to control whether the express services will stop at those popular congested points to which most passengers will travel, where fare stages end and to where passengers who want to join the express services come by bus? How will it be possible to control that?<br><br>
From my understanding of the notes given to the Committee by the Minister, the routes to be controlled by the local authorities will no longer apply. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that, because if a bus service in a normal urban area goes from point A to point B, the traffic commissioners can determine which route that service takes and will take congestion factors into account. As the Bill stands, I do not think that the local authorities can control those routes. Unless the Minister can tell the Committee that there is some reference to local government route changes in the notes which I have been unable to find, it appears that the service can go by whatever route that it wants, picking any street, short-cut or way that may be

desired without any consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The local highway authority has traffic management powers, and if the hon. Gentleman is worried about problems of parking, traffic flow and so on, the local authority has adequate powers to deal with them.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was right in saying that traffic commissioners will no longer have power to control the routes which should reduce the present number of rather absurd situations where express services are sometimes not allowed to pick up passengers from the most popular parts of the cities they are trying to serve, because some other operator has persuaded the traffic commissioners to keep the express service away from the picking-up points that are most convenient for passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of judgment. I do not know about the experiences of the Parliamentary Secretary, but in my constituency the reason an express service may not be concentrated in the main area is because the main bus station cannot competently deal with all the demands placed upon it by the present urban bus traffic system. That is why the express service is separated, and I believe that sort of position exists up and down the country. In many cases, the people operating from such bus stations are the same people who operate express services, so they are hardly likely to object to themselves. Normally, the objections come from the local authorities, which claim their areas are too congested. In many cases, bus and rail centres have been brought together, which, with urban development, has prevented express services from operating.<br><br>
However, in view of what was said by the Parliamentary Secretary. I must refer to the notes he gave to the Committee. Paragraph 3 of the comment on clause 3 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"certain traffic management powers of local authorities are restricted in respect of stage and express carriages".</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that local authorities will no longer be able to intervene to determine where an express service picks up and sets down passengers? I agree that it would be logical to do so, because we have taken away that power of determining routes from the traffic commissioners, and because, through competition, we are leaving it to the operator to decide where he picks up. I assume that we are limiting—in this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
Bill or elsewhere—the traffic management powers of the local authority to determine where he picks up or sets down. If that is correct, one wonders whether there are any controls at all on the development of express carriages.<br><br>
If the Government do not want to give a free hand to express carriages, and say that one major control will be that a person cannot travel for less than 30 miles on that particular service, or that the pick-up point shall be between certain points—the other conditions contained in the amendment— that will be the only condition affecting express pick-up points because, as is made clear in the notes, express bus operators will no longer need a road service licence. Indeed, if they did need a licence, they would have to go to the traffic commissioners, yet they are being freed from the control of the traffic commissioners.<br><br>
If the express bus operator has no road service licence and he breaches the 30-mile provisions—assuming that the Committee accepts the Government amendment— what control will there be on him? He cannot lose a road service licence, because he will no longer need it. If a number of people get on the bus and the operator flagrantly breaches the regulation—because for example, he wants to keep the good will of the people on the Jones express, instead of the Smith express, and says "You can get off here because if I do not let you do that I shall lose your custom to Smith", and he allows a person to get off the bus at 29 miles instead of 30 miles, because otherwise there would be a lot of aggravation between him and the particular passenger—the only enforcement agent is the driver.<br><br>
It is unfair to put the driver in that situation, particularly when there is an increasing number of assaults on drivers. It is unfair for there to be no kind of control on the licence. What will be the penalty for a bus operator who disobeys the terms of the amendment by flagrantly breaching the position? He cannot lose his licence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The penalty will be £200. He is operating a stage carriage without a road service licence if he flagrantly defies the conditions of the express carriage. He notifies the commissioners of the terms of his express carriage, and if he then fails to comply with those conditions and sets down passengers within the 30-mile limit, he will be com-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
mitting an offence under clause 4(5), in effect operating a stage carriage service without a road service licence. The penalty laid down is £200 for every offence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that intervention. So in that sense it becomes a fare stage, even though it is considerably further than the place where that fare stage applies—in other words, if it ends at 30 miles, the incident could have taken place 45 miles outside the particular area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think the hon. Gentleman will realise that he is straying again. It is possible to discuss what he is discussing, but not now. The amendment seeks simply to change the definition in rather limited respects.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is tightening the provision for the purpose of better enforceability, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Would it not be easier to discuss enforceability when we come to road service licences, for example?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But the operator does not need a road service licence, Mr. English. You will be telling us, no doubt, not to discuss a bus that is no longer in the relevance of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But there is the "clause stand part" debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, Mr. English, but there is the enforceability point.<br><br>
We are not convinced by the Minister's argument. I accept that the amendment may improve the Bill technically, in the sense that it now makes clear that the 30-mile provision relates to the passenger. But the provision's effectiveness relates to whether it can be enforced and, indeed, whether people recognise it to be enforceable. If the provision is not enforced, there will be conflict with other transport systems in a way which is somewhat different from the way in which it was envisaged. However, I shall develop the matter when we come to the "clause stand part" debate or in later clauses relating to penalties.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister, in replying, will give us some information on two matters
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
to help us for later stages. What was the thinking of the Government which made them change from 25 to 30 miles? Why was it not changed to 50? A line must always be drawn; I understand that. But I should like some indication of Government thinking on the matter.<br><br>
Secondly, could the Minister confirm what we suspect from his notes about the local authority's management powers over the routes of the bus? It seems that there are no controls. Are these powers to be taken away from local authorities? A clarification would certainly help us in considering other aspects of the Bill later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You ruled earlier, Mr. English, that my right hon. Friend must not use his map, because what the map showed must be capable of being explained in words. I find some of the material about the distances of stage carriages and express services almost impossible for me to explain in words. I hope that you will forgive me if anyone, apart from me, loses the thread of my argument.<br><br>
One thing that strikes me as odd is that, although the Conservatives are supposed to be the party of the status quo, they are setting about changing the status quo in this clause and in many others for no apparent reason. The Minister has no justification, either for the clause or for his amendment.<br><br>
I should like to put some questions to the hon. Gentleman. If, according to his own, non-Conservative theories, the relaxation of controls will stimulate further competition which, according to his own philosophy, will automatically benefit the public—which I doubt—why is he removing the controls on express services, where there is already a good service, and retaining controls on stage carriage services, where there is at present a bad service? If he followed his own philosophy through, he could maintain the controls on the express service and dispense with them on the stage carriage service, to the benefit of the public. He is not doing that.<br><br>
The Minister must explain the advantages of retaining any element of control below 30 miles or, if our amendment were carried, 50 miles. He must also demonstrate why there is a sudden sea-change at the point where he draws a line. The case for retaining control either simply stands or falls. It is not related to distances.<br><br>
We must accept, until our amendment has been carried, the view that a line will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0268">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
be drawn. I have received representations from people working in the bus industry, and from other people interested in transport, and even from what I should expect to be a haven of Conservative philosophy, the Luton and district chamber of commerce and industry. All make representations against the short distance beyond which express carriage services will be— literally—out of control.<br><br>
It is quite clear that a substantial chunk of highly profitable routes, between 30 and 50 miles in distance and at present run by the major respectable operators, will face severe competition. I accept that if there is a substantial and real reduction in the cost of travelling from A to B, there may be a marginal increase—this is where I differ from the Minister, as he obviously thinks that it will be phenomenal—in the number of travellers. If there is to be increased competition, and if this is the area which pays the existing operators best, it seems likely that their profits, because of that 30 to 50 miles element, will suffer severely.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Certainly that is what the National Bus Company thinks. I believe it said that about £5 million profit came from that tranche of travel. That profit of £5 million is important to the company, bearing in mind the extent to which it carries out cross-subsidisation and the number of references which the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister have made to the importance of rural and stage-carriage services, the value which they place on them and the benefits that they will gain from the Bill's introduction.<br><br>
It appears that, as a consequence of this tiny bit of the Bill, there will be a substantial reduction in profit on profitable services, which will reduce the amount of cross-subsidisation that the bus companies will in future be able to devote to non-paying rural services. I know that there are Conservative Members, including the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), who do not believe in any degree of cross-subsidisation. That is a perfectly tenable point of view, but it is wholly at variance with what exists at present and with what will exist when the Minister has done his worst.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be a tenable point of view but it is not the one that I have expressed.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to take that correction. However, on occasions, the hon. Gentleman seems to have come close to holding the view that I attributed to him. But perhaps I did not listen carefully enough.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Higgins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The matter will not arise until a later stage of the Bill, when I expect to say something about it. However, my view is that there are serious objections to extensive cross-subsidisation, but obviously it depends on the area that is being covered. I am not suggesting that there should be absolutely no cross-subsidisation within a matter of 10 yards, but an individual case would have to relate to the area covered. No one would seriously adopt the extreme view that the hon. Gentleman puts forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a relief. Purity of principles becomes sullied on both sides of the Committee at a rate of knots. As I said earlier, some matters are difficult to put into words.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman always has a choice, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very close to exercising that choice by sitting down.<br><br>
The Minister has totally failed to justify the 30-mile limit that he proposes. He has not explained why he was willing, in the face of representations from practically every organisation that he consulted, to contemplate an increase from 25 to 30 miles. He must now justify why he is not prepared to accept an increase to 50 miles, because that seems to have considerable importance for the rest of the bus industry.<br><br>
Indeed, I would go further. On clause stand part the Minister will have to justify his wish to decontrol express services. What loss to the travelling public or what increase in problems to potential operators would there be if the existing controls were maintained? If those controls were maintained, boundary problems and difficulties of enforcement would disappear.<br><br>
We are only on clause 3 of the Bill, as you may have noticed, Mr. English, but already we have had very long discussions about what even Conservative Members accept are considerable difficulties of enforcement. The difficulties of enforcement concerning the boundary between stage carriage and express carriage seem just as likely to prove awkward for those who have to enforce them as the car
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0269">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
sharing provisions in clause 2.<br><br>
We are supposed to be cutting down bureaucracy and making it easier for the police to do their job of stopping genuine crime rather than investigating technical offences of this nature. The Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of his right hon. Friend —who is no doubt eagerly attending the Cabinet meeting at this moment—has to justify his desire to remove a minor element of control over express carriages and to introduce instead certain other boundary distinctions which will make it difficult for operators, police, local magistrates and everyone else concerned with the operation of buses to do their job. They will find it difficult to know whether they or their competitors may be breaking the law. The Department is likely to become involved in objections by one operator against another. Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary has to justify any decontrol of express carriages.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At one point I thought that there were some signs of agreement between us on the definition of "express service". The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) confirmed that in modern conditions a definition based on distance limits of some kind is preferable to one based on fares, which has been the practice in the past. The change from a fare definition to a mileage definition will take some services, at present defined as express services, into the category of stage carriage services. I shall not explore that argument further, as it is accepted on both sides that express services should be defined by distance rather than by fares.<br><br>
At one stage I also thought that it was being conceded that there was a case for taking express services of some kind outside the control of traffic commissioners. The amendment suggests that the limit should be 50 miles. I am not saying that I accept the amendment, but, should the Committee carry it, would the Opposition accept that for distance of more than 50 miles there is an argument for going outside traffic commissioner control? The right hon. Gentleman will no doubt consider that proposition. The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) may be reluctant to do so, because of the effect on British Rail. Nevertheless, that is a possibility. Therefore, we are arguing about a difficult point
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
to decide with absolute certainty—namely, whether 30 miles or the alternative of 50 miles canvassed here is the right distance beyond which to decontrol express services.<br><br>
I do not wish to go outside the terms of the amendment, so I shall not reply in any detail to those points which did. I wish to make clear that an express service, as defined, will have a minimum passenger journey of whatever length the Committee chooses. It may also be either an excursion or a tour. I shall explain that later. The only other condition that it has to fulfil to be outside control is notification to the traffic commissioners. Notification is intended to ensure that the person offering an express service has some genuine commitment to the service. That is the main point that we were hoping to fulfil by making the requirement that details of the service had to be notified. From those details the traffic commissioners will see the minimum journey distance intended for any passenger carried. That is the intention of our amendments.<br><br>
Another small feature arises in regard to the definition of express services which takes those services outside traffic commissioner control. I was asked about traffic management control and what effect that would have on express services. The answer is tucked away in schedule 5, where there is a small amendment to the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967. That alters the existing arrangements in one particular.<br><br>
At the moment, the traffic management powers of local authorities are restricted when it comes to stage carriage and express services. The 1967 Act does not allow road traffic orders to prohibit or restrict waiting of stage carriages or express carriages. This Bill will remove the reference to express carriages so that curtailment of the power of local authorities will go. We will extend the power of local authorities to make road traffic areas to prohibit or restrict the waiting of express carriages because of the difficulties already foreseen by the hon. Gentleman, that the traffic commissioners will lose their power to prescribe the stops because we are taking them outside traffic commissioner control.<br><br>
I return to the main point of why we have chosen this distance. The point made by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and his right hon. and hon. Friends is perhaps best generally described as cross-subsidisation. The argument of the operators, who seek
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0270">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
to have the right definition, as they see it, of express service, is that they need to have protection for a considerable number of services which are profitable and which generate revenue which supports other, more local services. To a certain extent, that is an acceptable argument. All one is trying to do is form a judgment as to which level should be set within which one is legitimately reserving to the traffic commissioners the right to have a look at cross-subsidisation between services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I believe you ruled that I was not in order on these amendments to discuss matters appertaining to fares. Surely the argument as to whether a service operator in this way will provide a revenue falls within that ruling? If it does not, I should be happy to pursue the issues. I took the view that it was open to argument, but I assume that your ruling is that it is not relevant and in order on these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I deliberately stopped the right hon. Gentleman so that the Minister would not have to reply to his remarks. That is precisely why I was trying to restrict the debate when it was being initiated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to confine myself to the one argument that is relevant to distance. In effect, in seeking to extend the distance from 30 miles to 50 miles—although I do not think many operators wish to go that far—the Opposition are seeking to protect the revenue of operators over a slightly wider range of services in order to increase the ability of those operators to subsidise more local services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I allowed the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) to put that point, to which I take it the Minister is replying now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that this is the relevant point and one of the most valid ones to consider when determining how to arrive at the correct distance.<br><br>
One of the first points to notice, in order to get the argument into perspective, is that very often the people providing the express service and the stage carriage service will be, as now, one and the same
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
operator. To take as an example the National Bus Company, I am sure that that company operates many stage carriage routes where the total journey length from end to end is over 30 miles—in some cases over 50 miles.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
In many places where there are substantial centres of population at either end of the route, it will be discovered that the same operator is providing a stage carriage service between two towns or cities that are 30 miles to 50 miles apart, as well as providing an express service along the same route. Where there is a well-established operator in a strong market position in a specific geographic area, it is by no means unusual, when an express service is justified, for the same operator to provide that service. Normally, a well-organised operator who is in that market will not be vulnerable to a competitor who might be reckless enough to try to come in and interfere.<br><br>
Other than that, one has to reach a judgment about how far, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) indicated, it is legitimate to contemplate cross-subsidisation from express long-distance services to the local services in an area. Thirty miles seems to have some reference to the locality. To quote a 50-mile service—a 49-mile service would be the maximum control if the Opposition had their way—as having a crucial bearing on cross-subsidisation of local services seems to be stepping too far.<br><br>
Perhaps I can put it the other way, adopting the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). He referred to the position of British Rail and the attitude taken by one of the operators with whom he had had discussions. Most people with an interest in passenger transport seek to put forward arguments for opening up competition in areas which at present are the market of a rival, but to try to restrict competition in an area that is very much their own. Therefore, one must examine critically the representations of operators, and ask what is the difference within which it is obvious that terminal points have a direct bearing on most local stage-carriage services and what is the limit within which it is not.<br><br>
There have been representations from non-operators of passenger transport who took a somewhat different view of what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0271">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 487</span>
the distance should be. The Association of District Councils appeared to want the mileage limit reduced from 30 to 15 miles. It wanted to go in the other direction. Our position was that we began, as the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness said, by contemplating 20 miles because at 20 miles few of the present express services would have ceased to be express. By the time we got to the consultation paper, we had come to 25 miles, which seemed right. We listened to the kind of argument that the Labour Government had listened to in their canvassing and discussions, and were persuaded that 25 miles would have an effect. We think however that 30 miles meets the point, applying judgment in the end to the kind of conflicting interests I mentioned earlier.<br><br>
Let me cite another factor in trying to arrive at what the right distance should be. Subsection (2) shows that we are trying to define "local service" on the one hand and "express service" on the other. We are contemplating reserving for the traffic commissioners, except in trial areas, control over the network, but opening up to new operators competition and extension of express and long-distance services. If we go beyond a figure of 30 miles, to which we have now moved, we are getting far away from anything remotely like a local service.<br><br>
Let me give some practical examples. If we went to 50 miles, as the Opposition's amendment proposes, non-stop services between London and Southend and between Edinburgh and Glasgow would be defined as local services for the purposes of the Bill and would not, as would be the case if our definition was adhered to, be express services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not local.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 3(1)(<i>a</i>) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"a 'stage carriage' is a public service vehicle being used in the operation of a local service."</p></blockquote>
A "stage carriage" is something which provides a local service. That is not tortologous, but is part of the definition of a stage carriage. In examining the distance, one is seeking to determine whether it is a local or express service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right about that. It is the definition of local and fare stages. There are a number of argu-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
ments about that, consistent with the argument that control would presumably come under the commissioner. The commissioner could decide whether he wanted a fast stage between A and B up to 50 miles. That would not prevent the service, but would entail the service being agreed by the traffic commissioner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having dealt with the slightly pedantic point of which phrase I was using, that a "stage carriage" is a carriage which provides a local service, the hon. Gentleman is right to point out that if it is not an express carriage it becomes a stage carriage. But is a non-stop service between Edinburgh and Glasgow a stage carrier, to be dealt with on the same basis as a London Transport bus with stops every 200 yards serving the middle of the city? One is plainly going into a different sort of operation. When we get to more than 30 miles we are talking about long distances, with express services of the sort that we think would benefit from competition.<br><br>
I move finally to the main point which is, as usual, the fear of the Opposition about competition. They claim they are protecting the interests of the passengers by keeping this type of service from the damaging effects of competition. They have consistently invoked the National Bus Company in support of their argument. However, I refer to some of the recent statements made by the National Bus Company, which is already anticipating the likely change in express services that the Bill will make. <i>The Times</i> of 17 January 1980 contains a report by the transport correspondent, Michael Baily, who has clearly been in touch with the NBC and reports statements by it. He reports a remark by Mr. John Burkes, the controller of NBC who says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Vigorous competition from private coach operators is expected as a result of the Transport Bill. But National Express, with the advantage of a coach network of 600 routes linking almost every town in the country regards that as a 'spur rather than a threat'."</p></blockquote>
He reveals that National Express have been doing market research into the potential for inter-city long distance travel. Again I quote from <i>The Times:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>"The present ten million passengers a year on 2,000 inter-city coaches could be increased if only more people would try it, market research has shown."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0272">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point is that there is plainly a market which could be developed. There are passengers who would take advantage of cheap long distance travel. It confirms that the present arrangements under existing law have not developed the provision of transport to meet that market. As the controller of the NBC said, bringing this area out of traffic commissioner control, removing from new operators the burden of having to fight their competitors in an application before the commissioners, will bring more operators into the area and plug a gap in present passenger transport provisions.<br><br>
I agree that it poses a threat to British Rail, if competition can be called a threat. I believe in competition for British Rail, just as I do for the NBC. Competition should be seen as a spur, not a threat. One opens up the opportunity for more operators to provide long-distance minimum stop services, which could provide one of the cheapest ways of moving between major centres.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes a fair point. That is I presume the position of the National Bus Company. It was part of the argument I alluded to without going into because of the clear definition of the rules of debate. There can be benefit from the Bill. There is no doubt of that. It is called getting into the profitable routes. There is no doubt that that will happen. But the Minister must bear in mind that the National Bus Company says that as regards the rural bus services, and other areas, it will pull out of the unprofitable routes.<br><br>
The NBC says that it will use the Bill to pull out of the unprofitable areas and concentrate on the profitable routes. That may be in the interests of National Bus Company, but we are concerned about the integrated passenger transport system which that undermines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have heard that argument, but I have not been able to follow the logic through to its conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will give the evidence later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had better await that evidence. I fail to see why, when there is an operator, let us not name a specific one,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
with an established well-organised business in passenger transport, and we so change the rules that a new market is opened up and new possibilities are presented to him—I can clearly understand the attractions for that operator of developing his business so as to move into that new market—then as part of that process he should necessarily abandon other parts of his existing business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They will not be profitable. It is the oldest law in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall at other stages get on to the position in rural areas where operators find present services unprofitable and to revenue support, and so on—all those matters are being ruled out of order in our debate on clause 3.<br><br>
The fact that we shall be giving the National Bus Company the opportunity to win the extra revenue that it is claiming by freeing the express business should not have any damaging effect on its ability to fulfil its statutory role and maintain the rest of its services. Giving the NBC the opportunity to earn extra revenue will not damage its ability to keep and maintain the remainder of its business.<br><br>
In conclusion, I believe that we should examine the interests not only of the operators but of the passengers. Those are usually not in conflict, but in absolute harmony. Many passengers would like to use cheap express services, but they do not exist at present. As all the operators know, when the Bill becomes law there will be a welcome improvement in our express bus services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In light of what the Minister said, it is necessary to make clear that none of us on the Opposition side is pursuing the matter with a view to furthering the interests of the National Bus Company. We have spoken to a number of bus operators about the Bill—including NBC representatives—to local authority associations, individual authorities and a number of trade unions with members working in the bus industry. We have even gone to bus stops and asked passengers what they think.<br><br>
If some of our amendments happen to coincide with the opinions of the National Bus Company, that is either because we agree with its judgment on the matter or, even though we disagree with the company, we believe that the Minister is more likely

to accept its views than ours.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that assurance. I should like to make clear that we keep talking about the National Bus Company because the Opposition have cited it so frequently today. In any event, I would see nothing wrong in the Opposition's looking after NBC's legitimate interests.<br><br>
In the same way that Labour Members do not want to be thought of as the spokesmen for that company, I do not want it thought that I am hostile to its interests. We have tried to come to conclusions that we consider to be in NBC's interests. There may sometimes be misunderstanding or disagreement between us, but there is no hostility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the Edinburgh-Glasgow express service and seemed to imply that competition was needed, presumably because it is one of the Scottish bus group's most profitable services. Would he agree that the effect on the group's finances would lead to the eventual withdrawal of many of its rural services which exist only because of the cross-subsidisation policy that arises from the profits made on such services?</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 67, in page 5, line 1, leave out from "(b)" to first "the" in line 3.<br><br>
The amendment proposes the omission of the reference of excursion or tour in determining whether a service should be excluded from the new licensing procedures. It is suggested that the distinctions between excursion, tour and express may often be unjustifiable and that there may be cases where the provision could mask evasion of the new licensing system. I believe that this part of the Bill does nothing to resolve that difficulty, and, in fact, may intensify the problem.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary. There is a big difference between us, because he is saying that our fears about cross-subsidisation are groundless. But the document from the NBC from which the Parliamentary Secretary read went on to say that from now on it will operate purely commercially. That surely rules out cross-subsidisation. So that the Parliamentary Secretary can give credibility to t his argument, will he tell the Committee what method of monitoring he has to see which of us is right? Will he give a cast iron assurance that if we are right and he is wrong and cross-subsidisation becomes badly affected, with rural lines starting to close because of that, the Government will step in to foot the bill for the cross-subsidisation that will be lost as a result of the Bill? If he can do that, there may be some credibility in what he said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose in his place and claimed to move,</i> That the Question be now put.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the Question be now put:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 6.</p>
<p>As drafted, the Bill makes as a condition of running an express service, free from traffic commissioner control, a requirement to meet either of two conditions. Given that the distance criteria previously discussed are met, the operator has either to run an excursion or tour or to give particulars of the service to the commissioner who would then have no control over it.</p>
<p>The Minister, in dealing with a previous amendment, stated what he saw as the purpose of giving those details to the commissioner. He saw that as being a commitment on the part of the operator to provide that service. I think that he will accept that if that is the case there will be no commitment on the part of those who choose this definition of an express
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
service to run a tour or excursion.</p>
<p>A considerable difficulty will then arise. If the route goes beyond 30 miles, given the amendments now made, the service will not be affected. It it is within 30 miles, it will be affected. Therefore, for the purpose of the amendment, an operator who wishes to run an excursion or tour within 30 miles is not excluded, but one who wants to run his excursion or tour beyond 30 miles is excluded. That seems to raise a strange difficulty of definition and of practical operation.</p>
<p>Presumably a person wishing to run an excursion or tour over a certain distance can put up a notice in the market place on Saturday morning, saying that he is running an excursion to somewhere or other in half an hour's time and inviting people to join it. But if the distance that he proposed to take his passengers were different, he would come within the control. That seems silly, and I am not sure that it is what the Minister intended.</p>
<p>To take a specific example from my own area, there are existing non-stop services from Barrow-in-Furness to Blackpool. It is a circuitous and in some places a rather attractive route. It takes one around Morecambe Bay, gives one the chance to look up at the lovely Furness fells and then takes one down to Blackpool.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As one born in Southport on the other side of the estuary, I feel that the hon. Gentleman is not merely straying, but straying along a path which is highly undesirable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The rules of order take no account of local loyalties and commitments in these matters. I turn to the practical case of people who make the journey for strictly business purposes and are not at all interested in the scenic beauty of the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the only reason why anyone would go to Blackpool.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having reached Blackpool on one of the few clear days, they can look across the bay and see the cranes of the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. But let them not be fooled by the clear day—it will probably be raining by the time they get round the bay.<br><br>
If somebody is operating a non-stop service from Barrow-in-Furness to Blackpool on a regular route and to a regular
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
timetable, it would require to be licensed as an express service. I suppose that if only return tickets were issued, there might be some question as to the length of the journey. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will give us his view on whether that controls the length of journey, or whether the stopping place constitutes one leg of the return journey. However, that is not vital to the argument about whether an excursion or tour is involved.<br><br>
To make that journey by bus—and there must be many similar instances in the country—it is necessary at some point on the route to be more than 30 miles from the starting point. If the route used took in the motorway, that would certainly happen.<br><br>
But let us suppose that the operator used some of the roads in the area which make it possible to go from Barrow-in-Furness to Blackpool without going as far as the M6 motorway—one can go to Carnforth, for instance—he would operate within the definition limits. I do not think that that is what the Minister has in mind. It is up to him to explain what he wants on the subject of excursions and tours. I could understand him if he said that excursions and tours were different from normal express services and that, therefore, all excursions and tours should be dealt with differently, but he is not saying that.<br><br>
By coupling the provision for an excursion or tour with his definition of express, the Minister is making them subject to part of the same test as to distance. Having qualified—by taking the excursion and tour outside the 30 miles as defined—a person can say "I do not need to give any particulars because it will be a tour or excursion". That cannot be done if the person operates within the limit.<br><br>
There are always difficulties in drawing lines. It can be argued that it is a bit barmy when we come down to a few yards more or a few yards less, but here we are dealing with something that is a particular category.<br><br>
I want to latch on to the word that the Minister used—"commitment"—because it is a good one. If the purpose of informing commissioners is to ensure that there is some sort of commitment by operators, I do not believe that that commitment should start or finish at 30 miles, as defined in the Bill. If there is a different purpose in the case of tour or excursion operators which I have not understood, I hope that the Minister will explain that purpose to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0275">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
the Committee so that we can try to reach a commonsense and practical approach to how one reconciles the difference between excursion and tour operators, in relation to giving particulars, and other operators who are governed for the first part of the test in the clause by exactly the same sort of distance operation limits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to the right hon. Gentleman's speech. He did not say quite what I expected and I confess that so far I have not been able to see the difficulty he envisages.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman is right when he says that, as the Bill stands, we are debating whether or not a service is an express service. It will be an express service in just the same way as the service that we have just been discussing if it travels more than 30 miles. That will include many excursions and tours in which at some stage passengers are taken more than 30 miles, as the crow flies, from the picking-up point to the setting-down point. After all, one of the characteristics of an excursion or tour is that the picking-up point and the setting-down point are more or less the same place. It is a round trip, and people go back to where they started.<br><br>
In all cases where the excursion or tour takes the passengers at least 30 miles from the starting point to the finishing point, no road service licence is required. Elsewhere —in clause 9, I think—the Bill provides that where the excursion or tour takes the passengers less than 30 miles away, the road service licence that will normally be required will be given virtually automatically where there is no competition with a stage carriage service.<br><br>
The effect of the right hon. Gentleman's amendment would be to require all operators of excursions and tours covering a distance of more than 30 miles to give particulars to the commissioners, as other express services have to do.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand why that should be necessary. I have already explained that in the case of express services of the sort that we were previously talking about—inter-city services between towns at least 30 miles apart—we require notification in order to ensure some degree of commitment to the timetable and the service that an operator is leading the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
public to expect.<br><br>
There is a danger—a faint possibility— that an insubstantial pirate operator might vaguely advertise an express service in such a way that members of the public were led to expect that there would be a bus to carry them from Newcastle to York at a set time on a set day, but might abandon the whole thing after two or three days. Many passengers would then turn up only to find that the operator had changed his mind.<br><br>
We do not require such services to seek a road service licence, but as a reasonable measure of consumer protection we shall require them to demonstrate their commitment to the service by notifying the traffic commissioners, in a manner to be prescribed, of the details of the service and so on.<br><br>
Excursions and tours do not fit into quite the same category. They are not regular timetabled services, but are usually part of a holiday package or pleasure trip. They will of course be advertised by the coach operator but they will normally be one-off operations for the passenger. A tour may be run regularly every week by the coach operator, but the passenger books a seat on a particular coach on a particular trip from, say, Barrow-in-Furness to Blackpool.<br><br>
It would be unnecessarily restrictive and onerous to require a coach operator, every time he wanted to organise an excursion or tour that took his passengers more than 30 miles from their starting point, to give the traffic commissioners full particulars of that tour. There is not the same interest there as in what one might describe as a timetabled business or commercial passenger service between a picking-up point in one town centre and a destination in another.<br><br>
Excursions and tours are trips of a quite different sort, and I think that one can rely on the usual arrangements under which passengers book their place on a set excursion with a certain operator. To require notification to the commissioners on every occasion seems to me to be a bureaucratic addition.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman looks as though he wants to give me some more guidance as to why he considers the requirement necessary. So far, I cannot see quite what he is driving at. I cannot see what purpose he feels would be served by requiring tour operators to notify, except that he considers that it would be confusing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0276">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
for the operators to have to give notification of some tours, but not others. I would have thought that every operator will know about the 30-mile rule the moment we bring the legislation into force. They will not find it particularly difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister and to the Committee for failing to make the point clear. I should have listened to your guidance with more attention, Mr. English. I erred and strayed from the way. I can only offer, by way of explanation, the example that I chose.<br><br>
Once I had mentioned my own constituency area, I suppose that I began subconsciously to think that walking on the fells, as a form of travel, might be preferable to going in any of these buses, however they may be defined. This time I shall try to keep to a strict explanation of the point. I shall not refer to any places.<br><br>
If an excursion goes more than 30 miles away from the starting point, it comes within the definition of express, except that it is not bound by the requirement to notify the traffic commissioners. Anybody other than a tour or excursion operator who operates a service over 30 miles has to inform the commissioners. The Minister regards that as a commitment on the part of the express service operator to provide the service.<br><br>
An operator of tours and excursions of less than 30 miles is in a different position, which requires him to apply for road service licensing. I hope that the Minister will intervene if I go wrong at any point.<br><br>
Operators of tours and excursions of over 30 miles are, therefore, in the same position as those of express buses, except that they do not have to notify the commissioners. Operators of tours and excursions of less than 30 miles are subject to road service licensing. It seems that there is a difficulty. Why should the operator of a 29-mile excursion have to go through the road service licensing procedure, when the operator of a 31-mile excursion is exempt not only from road service licensing but from any requirement to notify the Commissioner? By the same token, why should he not be regarded by the Minister as having the same commitment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The straight answer is that the right hon. Gentleman is looking at the wrong end of the problem. He should ask why we are keeping the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
requirement for application to the traffic commissioners in respect of excursions and tours going less than 30 miles. The reason is the same as that mentioned in the previous amendment. We want to make sure that services posing as excursions and tours do not threaten stage carriage operations. For services that never go more than 30 miles from the picking-up point, we have preserved the arrangements under clause 9.<br><br>
That requirement is not very onerous. As long as it can be demonstrated that such a tour is an excursion tour which does not compete with stage carriage services, a road service licence will be granted as of right. If the minimum distance that any passenger is carried is 30 miles, there is, as I said on the previous amendment, no risk of interfering with stage carriage services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's intervention was helpful. It underpins the main point which I wanted to mention. I argue that if there is a need for some check on excursions or tours of under 30 miles, to ensure that they do not cut across arrangements made for stage carriages, why is no check made to ensure that those who operate tours and excursions of over 30 miles do not interfere with notified arrangements of express services?<br><br>
The Minister is using a double-edged argument. If it is necessary to have the commissioners notified of regular express services, how can one, without any notification procedure whatever, ensure that somebody does not, under the guise of operating a tour or excursion of more than 30 miles, cut across the same route?<br><br>
We are not concerned about competition with express operators. We want express operators to have competition. We are not protecting them. We are protecting the passenger. The only protection that we think necessary for the passenger with regard to express operations is that notification of an ordinary, time-tabled express service from point A to point B is required to ensure that the operator is not a man of straw. He should make a genuine commitment, be likely to provide a consistent service, and to compete.<br><br>
We are not concerned if the service cuts across the interests of other express operators. We are not protecting them in the same way that we protect stage carriage operators. Hence, for stage carriage operators we retain the requirement in clause 9
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0277">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
concerning application to the traffic commissioners. Above that we are not bothered. We do not feel that the passenger protection is needed for excursions and tours and we think that it would be bureaucratic if every time an operator wanted to run a holiday trip or a tour to look at the lights in Blackpool he had to notify the traffic commissioners.<br><br>
The Minister's argument is becoming narrow in regard to his justification for notification. The Opposition are left with the principal objection, which we modified in the previous amendment only because we thought that there was a greater chance of the Government's acceptance on this point. There is a difficulty here. If it is merely a requirement that those operating over a distance of more than 30 miles notify for the limited purposes that the Minister has stated, he may well argue that quite a lot of people will not have to notify. I intend that if someone, by virtue of this most unsatisfactory definition of express services, is to be able to operate in all manner of ways beyond the 30-mile limit, all those in that category should have to give notification to the traffic commissioner.<br><br>
My reason is that the traffic commissioner, from now on, will be prevented from stopping people from operating these services in a great many cases. I do not want to go into the remaining checks and balances that count. That would unduly lengthen the argument. However, for practical purposes the commissioner will not be able to stop express operators and tour and excursion operators over the 30-mile distance. There will be no road service licence requirement on them.<br><br>
At the very least I suggest that if the traffic commissioner knows of the express operation, he should know of the other operation, because that is a factor which he will have to bear in mind in exercising his judgment on other matters that are left within his purview under the Bill. He will have a much more difficult job to do than in the past. He has different criteria and a narrower range of vehicles within his control. The least that we can do is to ensure that he has a knowledge of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
vehicles that are running outside the 30-mile limit definition and therefore fall into the rather strange definition of "express".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When listening to the Minister's arguments I always try to think of examples. The difficulties that we are discussing arise from the philosophy of the Government to take controls away, in this case from the traffic commissioners, and to introduce an element of competition. We shall always have a distinct difference between us over whether we should control in an integrated way or whether competition should apply.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary's replies clearly show that there may be competition between two operators. He clearly welcomes that. I have an example—perhaps no more scenic than that mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth)—of a service running from Leeds to Bridlington which attracts people who want to take an excursion to the seaside and, at the same time, provides a service beyond a distance of 30 miles for people who may want to travel for reasons other than visiting the seaside.<br><br>
If an operator runs an express coach between Liverpool and Bridlington or Scarborough, provided the distance is over 30 miles and fits in with the provisions of the amendment now agreed by the Committee, the operator will simply give notice to the commissioners that he intends to show by similar commitment that there will be two or three services or more a week, between points A and B, by way of an express service. I presume that the commission is provided with that information to indicate the commitment of the operator to provide some sort of service, because even if he does not carry out his commitment—</span></p>
