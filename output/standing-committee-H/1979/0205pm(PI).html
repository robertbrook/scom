	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 50, line 42, leave out "notify" and insert "consult with".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 94, in page 51, line 2, after "specified", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>bb</i>) any person who is already providing a stage carriage service in the area so specified;".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment to paragraph 2(1) of schedule 2 is intended to place upon a local authority that is proposing to make an application to the Minister for a trial area designation order a requirement to enter into consultations with the various bodies and authorities specified in the paragraph, rather than merely having to notify them of its intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It became clear in our debate this morning that the local authority, as defined for the purpose of this part of the Bill, is the county council. Some district councils might object to not being included in the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such consultation as is proposed by the amendment is brought into being, I think it possible, or at least conceivable, that the local authority concerned might reach agreement with the district councils and the other bodies listed in the schedule before the application is made to the Minister. That would save considerable time and effort for the Minister in what he determines. If, as he has indicated today, he wishes to select only two or three trial areas and he has about 12 proposals before him, I suggest the easiest way to discharge his otherwise difficult duties is to accept the amendment now. He will be able to look through the applications for
	<span class='label label-info column'>972</span>
designation and pick out the two or three which show, as a result of the amendment, that agreement has been reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that, as the Minister said, even if the amendment were not carried, it would still be possible for those other bodies or authorities to make representations about a proposal by the county authority. If they did that, the contents of those representations would have to be relayed to the Minister when he was considering whether to make a designation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a very poor substitute for an agreement. It means that the Minister would be sitting in judgment on whether the objectors or the county authority were right, as an alternative to the proposition in the amendment which would enable them, on discussing their objectives and difficulties with one another, to reach agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this might take some time. That was one of the arguments advanced this morning. Effective and constructive consultation takes time. But surely it is time well spent if agreement is reached on such a difficult matter. If the objectors can have their fears assuaged, if they can reach understandings and agreements and if they can deal with the body with which they should be able to deal anyway, for purposes of transport plans and policies, in a way that enables a number of agreed areas to come forward, I believe that all that is worth the wait of a few weeks or even a few months. A hard and realistic proposition is being put forward. Once the designation area is made it would be two or three years before the decision could be revoked. There might be some improvement and development of services if the Minister's greatest hopes are borne out. If our fears and those of certain district councils are borne out there might be total collapse of the passenger transport services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal turns on that decision and the evidence we have is that if services collapse in an area it is very hard to restore them. Therefore, I urge the Committee to accept that this is not a wrecking amendment, or even a fiercely or strongly probing amendment. It is a serious amendment which is meant to give the Minister's proposition about trial areas a greater chance of success. Failing that it would at least ensure that the proposition operates in those areas where those concerned agree that the attempt should be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0534">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>973</span>
made. That is a far better way forward than on the basis of conflict or of the Minister having to sit in judgment between a county council making a proposition and a number of objectors with whom it has not even discussed the matters of great importance to them that are tied up in the issues of the designation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken only to amendment No. 93 and not to amendment No. 94, but following the Minister's response I should like an opportunity to deal with that in the course of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to have the two amendments grouped together, Mr. Dean, or are we proposing to have a debate on amendment No. 93 contrary to your selection and launch on to amendment No. 94 when we have finished that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are selected for debate together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then may I suggest that it will be for the convenience of the Committee, as well as in the interests of the arguments about amendment No. 94, if the right hon. Gentleman will indicate his line of argument on both amendments when we could perhaps deal with the selection as a whole?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to assist the Minister if he intends to deal constructively with the serious propositions in both amendments, and if it helps him to know the reasons and arguments relating to amendment No. 94 I shall be happy to advance them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious that we should not begin a process of dividing amendments when they are grouped and having separate debates upon them. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that that would not be a helpful way to progress our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept that. Amendment No. 94 proposes that we should add to those people who should be either notified or involved in the process of consultation. Depending upon whether amendment No. 93 is carried, we should add to the list of such people in the Bill any person who is already providing a
	<span class='label label-info column'>974</span>
stage carriage service in the area that is specified for the purpose of designation. The present list in the schedule includes organisations that represent those who provide public transport services in the area but does not include the operators themselves. I believe that if there is to be a group of people who should be notified, to engage in the consultation or make objections to be considered by the Minister, it is reasonable that operators should be among them, because they will have had the experience and know the conditions that apply in the area from the point of view of an operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister, whilst wishing—as I hope he does—to give prior consideration to the travelling public, realises from his own experience in Whitehall that he cannot do that in every case. He needs to know the views of a number of people who have sought to run services in an area. Among them are the operators. Therefore, it is a straightforward point, but its full effect or impact depends to some extent on whether we carry amendment No. 93. If amendment No. 93 is carried, a wider degree of agreement might be reached, one which would carry even greater conviction than by merely notifying operators alongside the other bodies and enabling them to put their objections forward. Even if the Minister rejects amendment No. 93, amendment No. 94 would be valid. But amendment Nos. 93 and 94 combined would be a much better proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In taking the two amendments together and dealing with the problem of consulting as opposed to notifying we are covering ground which we covered this morning. We come down to the basis of statutory consultation as opposed to the ordinary informal consultation which we expect most local authorities to carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning I gave my reasons for suggesting that statutory consultations are likely to give rise to delay, and possibly dispute if extended to the district councils where a county council is considering whether to designate an area as a trial area. Those arguments are strengthened if, as is now suggested, the statutory duty to consult is extended not only to the district councils but to the appropriate employees' organisations, and so on. All the problems that I foresaw this morning would be compounded if every trade
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0535">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>975</span>
union and every organisation representing providers of passenger transport in the locality, including the railways, could claim that there was a duty on the county council, by statute, to consult them about the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) confirmed our fears when he said that even if a few months went by in this process it would not really matter because the designation order was so important. We do not happily contemplate the idea of several months going by in an elaborate procedure of discussion and consultation before conclusions are reached on trial areas. Some authorities have already begun open and public consultations with interested bodies about the possibility of trial areas in their counties. We see no reason why, once the Bill is enacted, the process of consultation should not be left to common sense and concluded speedily without prejudice to any of the interested parties. Perhaps I can avoid, therefore, repeating my arguments of this morning on consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 94, which the right hon. Gentleman said can either stand with amendment No. 93, by adding to the list of those who should be consulted by the counties, or stand alone if one adds to the Bill a further body of people to be informed of the intention to make a designation order. Having considered the arguments, I accept straight away that existing operators providing stage carriage services have a highly legitimate interest in knowing that the county council is contemplating such a proposal. Many of them would be included within sub-paragraph (	<i>c</i>), as members of organisations representing persons providing public passenger transport, but by no means all. There are many operators who do not belong to any of the organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having considered that point, it seems to me and to my right hon. Friend that there is some validity in the right hon. Gentleman's argument that we have omitted that group from the Bill as it stands. I therefore invite the Committee to accept amendment No. 94, which adds to the list of those who should be informed of the proposals the operators of existing stage carriage services. For the reasons already given, on which I expanded at greater length this morning, I invite the Committee to reject the sug-
	<span class='label label-info column'>976</span>
gestion of statutory consultation contained in amendment No. 93.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary is right. We have had all the shot and shell in the argument about consultation. I do not think that much more remains to be said. However, when this morning the Minister of Transport was asked whether his assurance that he would think about these problems extended to the consultation process, I believe that the Minister said that it would. He gave an undertaking to look carefully—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The undertaking that my right hon. Friend gave this morning was on the question of the revocation of an order designating an area as a trial area. My right hon. Friend's undertaking was clear—he is sitting alongside me and I shall not take it as a rebuke if he corrects me if I have misunderstood him. He undertook to look again at the three-year minimum period before an order could be revoked, and at the request that the district council should be consulted before a revocation order was made. The undertaking was only in the context of revocation of a trial area period. I see that the hon. Member for Newcastle, Central (Mr. Cowans) agrees, and that my right hon. Friend the Minister is nodding his confirmation as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as consultation about the first stage—the designation of trial areas—is concerned, there is nothing inconsistent in what any of us said this morning. We have covered the ground and explained why the Government do not at the moment contemplate statutory consultation at that stage. As I have said, it seems to us inconceivable that any county council will ignore the interests of district councils, operators and so on. Indeed, we know that in practice many of them are already having discussions with those bodies. The undertaking given this morning was on the revocation period and on consultation if revocation is being contemplated. That was the limit of my right hon. Friend's undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am thankful for that intervention. It stops me pursuing the point any further, as the undertaking was made in a narrower context than I had supposed. I accept that. However, I should have thought that, in the interests of con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0536">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>977</span>
sultation, amendment No. 93, which would replace the word "notify" with the words "consult with", could well be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two kinds of consultation. If consultation is undertaken in a reasonable spirit, progress can be made. But there is another kind of consultation, when one of the parties is being deliberately obstructive and trying to hold up the process. But the initiative can remain with county councils. They can consult, and if they feel that there is obstruction, that they are getting bogged down in detail, and that consultation is ceasing to be constructive, they can terminate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is not strengthening the consultative process at all. At one stage, I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that he was afraid that some organisations such as district councils might exercise a veto over the county council's plans. I think that that was specifically mentioned. But if the amendment were accepted there would be no danger of that. After all, we are trying to strengthen the consultative process. So long as the initiative remains with county councils, they can terminate consultations that are running into the sand and not getting anywhere. There is no question at all of a veto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, schedule 2 indicates a very convoluted form of consultation. First of all, the county councils are obliged to receive representations. They will then forward those representations to the Minister, as I understand it, and he undertakes to read them. So the Minister will see what has been sent in from the district councils and other sources through the letter box, as it were, of the county council. If there has been a constructive process of consultation, many of the problems the Minister might have had to look at on a piece of paper will have been eliminated before they come to him. Many of the difficulties will have been ironed out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think we need have a very long debate on this point. In schedule 2, we are only talking about the small change of consultation; we are crossing the 't's and dotting the 'i's. But nothing will be ruined if the hon. Gentleman accepts this amendment, which specifically uses the word "consult", and if he does so, we shall all know where we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's words on
	<span class='label label-info column'>978</span>
amendment No. 94. This is certainly a deathbed conversion, because throughout our debates there has been a remarkable reluctance by the Government to consider the existing operator. It has been as if the operator had some mysterious disease and should not be concerned or consulted in any way. I am certainly glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has invited the Committee to accept this amendment. Let us hope that we are seeing the dawning of a new age and that the Parliamentary Secretary will no longer use his rose-tinted spectacles—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Blue-tinted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not blue, but a mixture of blue and red, through which he now sees the facts and the logic. I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary has at last risen to the occasion and has seen that we are trying to be constructive and make reasonable representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On clause 93, I accept what the Minister said this morning. I nodded my head then to indicate acceptance. But I part company with the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary in that I cannot for the life of me see the logic of saying—and they have both repeated it again tonight—that when an order is revoked, it is necessary to look at consultations. That is exactly what was said. When revoking the order, they will look at consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one accepts the premise that there should be consultation when an order is revoked, should it not be argued in basic logic that there should be the same sort of consultation before the order is made? If the Minister can explain to me how he can turn turtle when an order is to be revoked, but cannot accept the logic of consulting when making an order which is to stand for three years or such time as he has promised to consider, it seems to me that logic goes out of the window. Are district councils which have not been consulted at all before the making of an order to be consulted all of a sudden when that order is revoked? What kind of idiot logic is that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister means what he says, and if he wants the trials to run for three years, surely there is a need for the maximum amount of consultation before the order is made, not when it is to be revoked. If the Minister accepts that one wants consultation when the order is revoked, surely by common logic he must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>979</span>
accept the point that there should be consultation before the order is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is worried about time. In Committee this morning he said that he expected that there would be about three trial areas. So we are not talking about mammoth administration—the setting-up of committees 	<i>ad nauseam</i>—that will take a lot of time. He is talking about three areas. I should like him to explain the logic that says "In revoking an order I will have consultation, but in making the order I shall not". I should be pleased to look at it, but, no doubt, as anti-logic, it will go into the Guinness Book of Records.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to draw the distinction between the two. When it comes to designating a trial area for the first time, I expect that some district councils will be against the whole principle of having trial areas. There will be a number of district councils, not least those controlled by the Labour Party, and I can foresee one or two controlled by the Conservative Party, which will not approve of the idea of experimenting, which will feel more comfortable and cosy in the present licensed situation and therefore, when consulted, will flatly wish to turn the whole idea down. That is before one comes to councils operating municipal bus services. Such councils have a particular interest which makes them fearful of the idea of their area as a trial area. That gives rise to the possibility, touched on by the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), of the idea that there may be consultations with more than one body of people—more than one district in the council—where that district's interests are flatly opposed to the whole policy of this part of the Bill and its aim is to seek to frustrate it if possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We foresee that, if one goes beyond the ordinary commonsense understanding that there will be discussions and exchange of views between the various councils, the Bill provides a statutory duty to consult upon a county council that is contemplating a trial area. Thereby we will be giving an opportunity for what is perhaps a small minority of districts to extend the process, to cast doubts on whether the full legal requirements of consultation have been finished at any particular stage and to suggest elaborate procedures, joint consultation committees and so on for carrying out the consultation. There-
	<span class='label label-info column'>980</span>
fore there would be a possibility that statutory consultation would give rise to delay, doubt and the extension of somewhat counter-productive argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once one has set up a trial area and is considering the possibility that a county council is moving to apply to revoke it because in its opinion it has gone wrong, a rather different set of circumstances applies. We are describing the areas as trial areas because there is something of the nature of an experiment about them. We believe that it will be to the benefit of counties to have trial areas. But we are being prudent and moderate in all things and are testing the temperature in regard to these trial areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a trial of any period, it is only right and proper that the fullest possible examination of the outcome of that trial should be undertaken. So it seems to us that the problems and difficulties that might be caused by delay at that stage are far less. If the worst fears of the Opposition have been realised and road passenger transport is collapsing throughout the locality, no one will want to delay the application and revocation. It will be rushed through with the quick and ready consent of the districts, not one of which will have any vested interests such as a municipal bus undertaking, pushing it in the direction of resisting the revocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if there is general disagreement among the local authorities about whether the trial area has been a success, in deciding whether to act on the application and to extend the trial area and refuse a revocation order, the Minister will be helped by the fullest process of consultation. We have not decided yet, but that is what my right hon. Friend undertook to look at this morning and that is the distinction that can be made between the two situations. It is for that reason that I do not think that there is any split logic in the difference that we have drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member's second point escapes me. It seems to have escaped him as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked, what is the position if, in effect, one has consultation on revoking but does not have prior consultation? That seems like going backside foremost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>981</span>
	<p>5 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is basically the same point, but it was perhaps within the case stressed by the hon. Member. There is all the difference in the world between a situation where we know that some districts will agree with the Opposition to be against the whole idea, and a situation where people are examining and experiments are being carried out. That distinction was drawn in giving an undertaking on revocation this morning, not on new orders, and, therefore, we are not disposed to accept amendment No. 93.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether this is a probing amendment or one that the Opposition will seek to press depends very much on what the Minister has to say about it. It is not immediately apparent to me from my reading of the Bill why, in trial areas, bus operators should lose the exemption from the prohibition of restrictions and waiting imposed by traffic regulation orders, and why, therefore, traffic regulation orders in those trial areas should apply to stage carriage operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>982</span>
	<p>receptive to debate, receptive to arguments; our attitudes are totally constructive towards the Committee. I am sorry that, on the many occasions when we accept Opposition amendments, it draws forth grudging praise from the Opposition benches, but we will not be daunted. We shall continue to press on with an open mind, and I would advise the Committee to accept amendment No. 94 on its own. We will not be deterred by the grudging praise, but will look with interest at all the amendments throughout our debate.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>As I understand the position the regulations which are now made by local authorities—presumably county authorities will do for the purpose of this argument—under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967 can require special waiting restrictions to be placed upon the waiting of other traffic, but they cannot put limitations on the waiting rights of either stage carriage or express services. I assume that the reason is that the traffic commissioner is responsible for attaching any conditions about waiting to the road service licence involved, and that therefore it is thought appropriate that, if the local authority has any views about the conditions which attach to the waiting of the express or the stage carriage vehicles running through their areas, they should represent those views to the traffic commissioner. He will then form a judgment upon the matter, and will attach or refuse to attach a condition to the road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part II of schedule 5, at the top of page 59, says, concerning the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So much of subsection (3) of section 1 as prevents a prohibition or restriction on waiting imposed by a traffic regulation order under that section from applying to an express carriage shall cease to have effect."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0539">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>983</span>
I presume that there is a general repeal of the effect of the Act upon the power of local authorities to make regulations in respect of express carriages. When I say "general", I mean that it will apply in every area, irrespective of whether it is designated as a trial area. That is the understanding upon which I move the amendment. If I am wrong, I am open to correction. But if that is correct, it seems that the Minister, in order to justify the third part of the clause, must show why, in the trial areas as in the rest of the country, the regulations cannot be applied by the local authority to the express services, but can be applied in respect of stage carriage services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who can run express services through the trial areas are not subject to waiting restrictions. Neither the traffic commissioner nor the local authority can put such a restriction upon them. They may stop where they like. They could cause almighty traffic jams, and nothing could be done about it. But the stage carriage operator, who was previously under a similar type of control, is now put under a new control, presumably that of the local authority in the trial area, only while it is a trial area. Presumably, if the designation order were revoked, road service licences would return and the 1967 Act would again apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems, therefore, that the stage carriage is clearly distinguished from an express service in being left without any control, whereas the stage carriage is being put under a type of control which has never existed before. It seems to me that some explanation is needed. I could see the argument for putting both under the control, or for putting them both under this condition if relieved of every other condition by virtue of being in trial areas. But neither of those situations obtains in the Bill, as I read it, and I hope that the Minister will explain why that is so.</p>
	<p>The Minister of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try to help the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee in this matter? Probably it arises from the drafting of the Bill, but I think that the right hon. Gentleman will agree at the end of the arguments that what we are seeking to do is probably in line with what he would like to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stage bus services outside trial areas are exempted from the scope of local authorities' traffic management orders controlling
	<span class='label label-info column'>984</span>
waiting and that is done by section 13 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967. The reason, as the right hon. Gentleman says, is that the conditions regulating PSV stopping places may be attached to a road service licence. As stage bus services in trial areas will not have road service licences, and as there must be some power to regulate waiting, the subsection removes this exemption and thus empowers the traffic authorities to restrict or prohibit waiting. That is the intention of what we are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to restore this exemption so that stage services in trial areas will not be affected by these types of order. We take the view—this is probably common ground—that the power of local authorities to restrict or to prohibit buses waiting in trial areas is important. It is expected that the number of bus services could increase, and that could cause problems, particularly in towns, if buses wish to stop to pick up passengers indiscriminately and disrupt traffic. The subsection is consistent with the removal of the same exemption—here there may be misunderstanding—for express carriages, and follows the principle that where special problems of congestion are likely to arise they are best dealt with directly by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it as shortly as I may. The subsection as drafted gives local authorities powers to make orders restricting the places where buses may wait. Normally this will be done by conditions on a road service licence, but clearly there will be no road service licence inside a trial area, therefore we are giving the responsibility to the local authority as part of its management function, and it seems to us logical for local authorities to deal with their special circumstances because, obviously, they will know what the situation is upon the ground. But the situation is the same for the express carriages, which are removed from the road service licensing requirement, and is consistent in that way. The amendment would restore the exemption so that stage services in trial areas would not be affected by these types of order. I suggest that the Committee is at one on this matter. We should require there to be some powers for traffic management inside trial areas. What the amendment seeks to do is to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment achieves what the commissioner is doing in some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0540">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>985</span>
circumstances with stage carriage services inside the trial areas. But a commissioner would take into account, certainly on profitable routes, if there were 10 applications for the route, how many could be allowed to run up that road. What would be the position of the local authority if it had a number of applications to run on one route, more than it thought to be safe? What criteria would it use to differentiate between applications A and B?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that in traffic management the local authority would have some control on pick-up and set-down points and, presumably, it would be able to designate what roads could be used, and if too many buses were going down one road. One could think of many examples which might constitute congestion. How would the local authority differentiate between two applications?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authorities have a general power in any event in this area. But the amendment concerns control over waiting. That is all that the subsection contains, and it is that power that the Opposition seek to remove. The subsection gives the local authority power to decide where buses will wait within trial areas. If a road were, for one reason or another, particularly popular for waiting buses, the authority could require that the buses wait elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we are at one on this point as long as the Opposition require some control over waiting. I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) that the control previously belonged to the traffic commissioners. Clearly he would prefer them to continue to have that control. If, however, the traffic commissioners are removed from involvement in the trial areas, I hope that the hon. Gentleman would think it reasonable that we should give the local authorities some power in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I wrongly stated the position in regard to the control of express carriages, so I shall put the matter clearly on the record. I understand that the effect of the repeal that I mentioned will be that local authorities can control the stopping places for express carriage services throughout the land, irrespective
	<span class='label label-info column'>986</span>
of whether there is a trial area designation order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the stage carriage services the effect of the Bill will be to hand over control of waiting to the local authority in trial areas only. In other areas where road service licences are issued, it will depend whether such a condition is attached to the licence by the commissioners. If the amendment were made, there would be no controls whatever on the waiting of stage carriages in the trial area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us to the difficult question of merits. I agree with the Minister that there should be some control over waiting in trial areas. There are difficulties in the operation of that control which stem partly from the adequacy or otherwise of notification procedures and whether the local authority will know of all the carriage services likely to operate. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Probably a greater practical difficulty for the authorities concerned would be the definition given in the Bill of "authority". Presumably it means that the county authority will have the power to make waiting regulations, whereas it is the districts that will be conscious of the traffic problems arising from unlicensed stage carriage operation. It would be helpful if the Minister could give us his thinking without committing himself, as we may have second thoughts later. I do not intend to press the amendment now as it would not achieve the effect that either I or the Minister would desire. But I should like to know whether there may be a case for allowing the district councils at least some primacy on waiting regulations within their own areas during the periods in which they are designated trial areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first confirm the right hon. Gentleman's understanding on the points regarding the express services and stage carriage. I do not think that there will be difficulties for the local authorities. We are giving them the power and there will be a requirement that the authorities inside the trial areas should be notified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the right hon. Gentleman's point on the traffic regulations, but at the moment the county is the only authority that can make the road traffic regulation orders. That being the case, there would have to be a fundamental change of the law to allow districts to make regulations. That is the position now, and it has not been changed for a number of years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment arises out of advice given to us from operators who are concerned with the definition of "stage carriage service". The use of different terms for what seems to be the same interpretation has caused confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with trial areas and bus services within those areas. That may be the distinction between "bus services" and "stage carriage services". I will deploy the argument as we were advised of it and perhaps the Minister will explain why those different terms are used and define them for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 is concerned with bus services within the trial area having a duty to publish information about those services. The stage carriage service has normally augmented a local service. I think that that is the context in which we have all been debating it, as indeed it is understood in previous legislation. But a bus service, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>988</span>
defined in clause 14, is also meant to be a stage carriage service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of a stage carriage service in clause 3(1)(	<i>a</i>)—which we have already dealt with—defines
	<br><blockquote><p>"a 'stage carriage' is a public service vehicle being used in the operation of a local service".</p></blockquote>
A public service vehicle is defined in clause 2 as being a motor vehicle carrying more than eight fare paying passengers. Yet clause 14(8) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'bus service' means a stage carriage service."</p></blockquote>
If "bus service" means "stage carriage service" why do we not continue to use the term "stage carriage service"? Presumably there must be some reason. If there is not, then clearly there is some confusion, which is why we should like to hear from the Minister. On the face of it there appears to be a reasonable argument for changing "bus services" as these amendments do, to "stage carriage services".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording used in the Bill may arise from various Finance Acts, to which there are further references in the schedules regarding fuel tax and rebates on it. But presumably if that is applicable to stage carriage services as defined here, it would still be applicable in the trial area. We are unsure as to why there should be a difference and we look forward to the explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are no hidden reasons for the difference. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) for drawing attention to a rather odd discrepancy in the drafting of the Bill. Unless later amendments draw attention to other instances, I think that the phrase "bus service" is used only in clause 14. As the hon. Gentleman said, "bus service" is defined in subsection (8) as "a stage carriage service". Clause 35 then provides that a "stage carriage service" is a service provided by "stage carriage", which "has the meaning given by section 3".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(1) (	<i>a</i>) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a 'stage carriage' is a public service vehicle being used in the operation of a local service".</p></blockquote>
A "public service vehicle" is defined in clause 2, and a "local service" in clause 3(2). Such is the clarity of language and draftsmanship employed in the Bill that the matter is easily solved. Nevertheless, I appreciate the weight of the argument that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0542">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>989</span>
to use the words "bus service" only in clause 14 adds very little, particularly when it is then defined at the end of the same clause as meaning "a stage carriage service".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am therefore grateful for the amendments. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central must prepare himself for a major blow when I advise the Committee to accept no less than 10 Opposition amendments which seem to us well founded and all of which improve the wording of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the consultation process and in discussions on various aspects of the Bill we were concerned that at some stages the needs and rightful desires of district councils to participate in discussion and to be consulted were lacking, perhaps quite justifiably in this case. No doubt there will be cries of delight from the Opposition, but I say again that this is a probing amendment. We did not wish to put in a statutory duty; we wished to probe this matter so that some form of discussion would arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also seemed to be of concern to the Association of District Councils. We have had consultations with that association, as no doubt have hon. Members on both sides of the Committee, and it seemed a legitimate point. We therefore seek the Minister's comment. I will not phrase the matter as strongly as I did this morning, in my unique new phrase which I hope will be used often by hon. Members opposite, a "strongly probing" amendment. This is merely a probing amendment.
	<span class='label label-info column'>990</span>
I shall be grateful for the Minister's comments upon it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally accept what my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Iain Mills) is saying.

Friend has put a powerful case and it is very much the Government's intention that we consult and meet the legitimate points raised by the Association of District Councils as often as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me is that this, in however small a way, will add to the burden of paperwork for operators. I am prepared to look at it again, bearing in mind my hon. Friend's remarks. If he will agree to withdraw his amendment on that basis, I shall seek to examine it further with a view to making progress on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I quote the example of Reading district council, which is a unique and separate council which operates within its area a quite profitable and successful transport organisation, albeit small. These existing, competent, profitable and working enterprises are concerned about being consulted. I am more than happy to accept my right hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>991</span>
pursuant to subsection (2)(	<i>c</i>) if it commences operation within fourteen days of the discontinuance of the service it replaces.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 95 paves the way for amendment No. 87. As worded, subsection (4) provides for a relaxation of the procedures for running stage carriage services in a trial area when unforeseen circumstances make it impracticable for an operator or would-be operator to follow those procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to see why such a provision should relate to a new service. New services, particularly if well organised, are not introduced overnight. They must be evaluated and planned. To suggest, as subsection (4) does, that there are circumstances in which a new service may be unforeseen is irresponsible. It is also an invitation to abuse the provision. Hence our amendment which suggests that reference to (	<i>a</i>) be omitted from subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I acknowledge readily that this might not apply in the case of a replacement service, because in organising a replacement service speedy action may be needed to ensure continuity of service to the public and that an efficient means of transport is provided to fill the gap which does not erode the potential for a good replacement bus service and take over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am assuming, naturally, that the speedy, less efficient or less economical temporary replacement is to be regarded as temporary in special circumstances, and that the Minister would wish, as we do, that after that short, temporary operation, a replacement bus service would take over normal operating services. In my view, a replacement service is not a new service, and therefore we should distinguish between the two. If it is a replacement service, it may be the same service but provided by a new operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that this may be an argument about interpretation. The amendment seeks to avoid any possible doubt. To that end, the second amendment adds a definition in subsection (8) to show the circumstances in which a replacement service is not a new service and can benefit from a relaxation procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will agree that we have taken a constructive approach to a provision dealing with a genuine operational problem that can arise in certain circumstances. I hope that it will never be the Minister's intention to put in such a provision as a general loophole under
	<span class='label label-info column'>992</span>
which people could operate anything other than ideal services without the sort of control that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that a line has to be drawn somewhere in drafting a measure of this kind. A line has to be drawn to decide when a replacement service is not a new service. Its only significance in relation to the relaxations I have mentioned is in the experience of the bus-operating industry. I admit, therefore, that the amendment is based entirely on the bus industry's experience, not my experience. But the industry has assured me that the two-week break is a practical division to make. The industry is probably the best judge, but I accept that the figure could be 21 instead of 14.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that if a service has failed, the replacement, to succeed, would have to be on an improved basis. That is a fair argument. But it is no good making changes if the public are not properly informed of those changes. The changes should be advertised. Moreover, by advertising, the chance of the service succeeding will be improved. So the service should be advertised, even if it is to run for an interim period. If the need to make the change is imperative, the replacement service will be seen as a continuation, not as a new service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have outlined the advantages of the two amendments. They remove the possibility of abuse without in any way detracting from what I take to be the Minister's intentions in the original drafting of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to break the habit of accepting Opposition amendments because, again, there is not a great deal between us. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman when he says that the amendments are an attempt to be a constructive improvement to the Bill. However, I believe, on consideration, that they would not achieve the purpose that he claimed. Indeed, they might create other difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 generally requires proper notification to be given of any new service or any change and variation in an existing service. They are important provisions for the protection of operators and the general public within trial areas. We are extremely anxious that trial areas should not be invaded by fly-by-night operators or by people who act as pure pirates, abstracting traffic from an existing service,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0544">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>993</span>
turning up without notice on a particular day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As these are important provisions, they should be waived only in extreme circumstances, but there could be unforeseen circumstances in which they were waived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman has conceded that in the cases of changes or discontinuances he can foresee circumstances in which there might be an unforeseen event that justified dispensation with the notice. I immediately concede that it is far more difficult to think of examples in which unforeseen circumstances might arise where a new service is being operated. I can only suggest one such example, outside that given by the right hon. Gentleman which he described as a replacement service, where there might be a strike or some other problem in a local newspaper which meant as a result that someone intending to provide a new service was not able to comply with the requirements of clause 14. I am sure that the Committee will agree that we would not expect that a strike in a local newspaper or something of that nature should have the effect of delaying the introduction of a new passenger bus service because the operator was not able to give the required notice. I agree that is a far-fetched example, but one that is just conceivable and for that reason the reference to subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>) is left in the Bill.

The other circumstance that we certainly anticipate is the replacement service where, for instance, an operator goes bankrupt and another operator wishes immediately to step in to maintain the service to the public. We would expect that to be interpreted as an unforeseen circumstance for the purposes of clause 14 and the notice not to be required. The right hon. Gentleman's amendment seeks to spell that out by making an explicit reference to replacement services at a later point in the clause. The trouble I anticipate is that that could give rise to disputes about exactly what is a replacement service for this purpose. There is no definition of "replacement service" at present in the Bill and one can conceive of arguments arising whether a replacement service has to be one that is identical in every respect with timetables, routes, fares and so on, so that the slightest deviation would render it not a replacement service and for the requirement for a notice to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>994</span>
I prefer the wording of the clause as it stands, which would allow common sense to be applied to individual circumstances. It would certainly cover the problems that might arise where an operator suddenly goes bankrupt and someone else steps in immediately. Even if he makes some minor variations to timetables, routes, fares and so on—perhaps even diverting one of his existing services to cover in part the route of the bankrupt operator—one would expect a ruling in all cases that that was an unforeseen circumstance and the position envisaged by the right hon. Gentleman and myself would be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude with an assurance. There is no question of the Government intending subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>) to be a loophole and as it stands there is no question of that. I accept that there is every reason in a trial area to require the proper public notification to be given. Indeed, last Friday I made a visit to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale) who had made arrangements for me to meet a representative of the firm of Jennings which conducts a long stage carriage service from Bude to Exeter. That representative had fears that if any part of his firm's route went into a trial area it might be possible for his stage carriage service to suffer occasional raids, if one likes, on his service whereby someone with a coach would suddenly turn up, heading along the route a few minutes ahead of the timetable and abstracting his passengers waiting at the bus stops. Other operators have expressed the fear to me that that might arise in trial areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was very glad to be able to put the fears of the representative of the firm of Jennings to rest and I think that other operators can be reassured that there is no question of a spare coach suddenly driving along the bus route and picking up passengers in the way that we are assured matters were conducted before 1930 and the introduction of licensing. Anybody who intends to set up a new service must notify and publish the details. As a result the operator can feel safe from sudden unexpected raids on his route. The public can feel satisfied that someone has a genuine commitment to the service and intends to run it seriously. Therefore, I repeat that there is no question of subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>) providing a loophole. I believe that there is no question of the present wording of the clause allowing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>995</span>
anything but genuinely unforeseen circumstances to provide an occasion for waiving the notification rules. I hope that I have persuaded the Committee that our wording suits the purpose and that the suggested amendment would not in practice achieve any benefit. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly accept that it is not the Minister's intention that trial areas should be used or abused in the way he has described. But he has not convinced me that the clause does not contain a loophole that would allow that. The wording:
	<br><blockquote><p>"making, otherwise than temporarily, any changes in a bus service to which this section applies"</p></blockquote>
almost invites people who wish to use the freedom of the trial area on a short-term basis to say that they are not covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to other people besides bus operators on the subject. Over the weekend I was at Leicester listening to local authority representatives discussing what they would do with their services if a trial area were instituted locally. One said that his authority was thinking of applying for a designation order. A representative from the neighbouring authority said that he was very interested. His authority had some buses that were idle at peak hours, and they might be slipped across the border now and again at slack times to pick up some of the other authority's trade. The first representative was horrified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There does seem to be a loophole. Perhaps my amendment is not the perfect way to deal with it, but certainly it is one way. The Minister has conceded that it is hard to imagine any situation precluded by the amendment that would normally be desirable. It is extremely doubtful whether even in the case suggested by the Minister the operator would be precluded from commencing an operation. Certainly it would be an unforeseen circumstance if the advert did not appear because of a strike at the local paper. But there are other ways of advertising which in such circumstances could be accepted as complying with the requirements of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a real difficulty here. There is some virtue in trying to distinguish between a new service and a replacement or temporary service. Unfortunately, the wording of the clause unintentionally
	<span class='label label-info column'>996</span>
invites a form of abuse. Since our aims are not at odds, I ask the Minister whether before Report he can produce an amendment that would achieve the effect that we all desire. That is to ensure that people could not come into an area like Vikings on a raid up the inlets, take advantage of unsuspecting legitimate citizens and then swiftly sail away along the roads, if not up the fjords of our coastlines. Both parties would like to achieve that end, but the wording is not adequate. No doubt the draftsman has fixed his eye firmly on law-abiding communities and is not too familiar with what actually happens in this area, where operations are not exclusively manned by law-abiding communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has a valid purpose. The clause aims to deal seriously with what is known to be a problem in the operation of trial areas. To prevent a loophole the temporary changes that are excluded from the advertising requirement have to be tightly defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends on their turn of phrase.

However, I believe that on this occasion their fears have run away with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked me to give an undertaking to reconsider the matter, but I cannot for the life of me see how the present working of the Bill fails to meet all the points that concern him. I have already sought to satisfy him that "unforeseen circumstances"—to use the phrase in the Bill—satisfactorily encompasses all the genuine cases that the right hon. Gentleman and I have in mind without giving rise to any fears about loopholes or fly-by-night operators. One must reach a firm conclusion about the matter. As I cannot at present see that any dent has been made in the wording of the Bill or any case has been set out which is not adequately covered, I cannot undertake to reconsider the matter before Report. It seems to me that the point has been fully canvassed and that the argument has now been closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. I can understand the logic of grouping a vast number of amendments together, but in this case not amendment No. 187. Amendments Nos 92, 145, 147, 190, 193, 194 and 195 all deal with offences for not publishing. But amendment No. 187 deals with the major offence of a contravention of a licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept your ruling, Mr. Dean, that the other amendments are related, but with amendment No. 187 there appears to be a contradiction in terms. This is the one amendment that is completely different from all the others. That being so, I should have thought that amendment No. 187 could have been dealt with separately, because it relates to an offence that is totally different from those offences covered by the other amendments with which it is at present grouped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All these amendments relate to the scale of fine, and therefore it is appropriate for them to be discussed together. But I am prepared to allow separate Divisions on any of these amendments at the appropriate stage if that is desired by any member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without wishing to challenge your ruling, Mr. Dean, the arguments on the level of fine and all the arguments relating to amendment No. 187 are substantially different from the arguments which we wish to deploy on the other amendments. Amendment No. 187 refers to a much more substantial offence in clause 21, in that it is the contravention of a licence rather than certain technical offences in not supplying information, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the representations made by two hon. Members and having had a little more time to consider the point made, I understand that there is a difference and that it would probably be better for the Com-

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael English</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>in the Chair.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend on this amendment to use any of the arguments about the increase in the rate of inflation, which obviously has a bearing on how appropriate a fine might be. If those arguments can be taken as read, and it can be assumed for the purpose of the speed and brevity of our proceedings that I in no way retract anything I have said on previous amendments dealing with the size of fines, I shall turn to the aspect of the amendment which is peculiar to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment will apply only to an operation within a trial area, and nowhere else in the country. I contend that in fact it will be very much more difficult to enforce the requirement of the clause in trial areas than it would be to enforce a similar requirement in other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the more relaxed situation in the trial area—the absence of the road service licence in particular, and the operator's freedom from the restrictions and conditions imposed by the licence—it will be very hard indeed for enforcement authorities to ensure that regulations, conditions and requirements such as those in clause 14 are complied with. It will be very easy indeed for an operator to slip through the enforcement net.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet there is a need in these trial areas for a form of discipline. I hope that the two sides of the Committee would not disagree about that. The Minister does not want—I must be careful, or the Parliamentary Secretary will tell me off again for my turn of phrase—to establish pirate enclaves where the writ of law no longer runs. He does not want to re-establish the Western frontier town before the sheriff arrived. He wants the trials to be conducted in a way which will give him a good and accurate guide to what would be the effects of a more general withdrawal of road service licences. That is my understanding of the Minister's intentions. Therefore, I suggest that it is in the Minister's interest, and the interests of those who are promoting the Bill, to look very
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0548">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1001</span>
carefully at any provisions of the Bill which could be flouted in such a way as to undermine that basic aim of maintaining a properly-disciplined service within the rules for the trial area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, therefore, that there is a need to counter certain enforcement problems by the introduction of the deterrent of a very heavy fine. Even if one accepts—as I certainly do—that it will be harder to catch the offender, the fact that the offender knows that if he is caught he is liable to a very heavy fine may deter him from failing to comply with the provisions of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been shown, unfortunately, in the area of traffic law, that a certain attitude is developing in some sections of the community—a very unhappy attitude for parliamentarians to contemplate. People weigh their chances of being caught, and think that if they take the chance, get caught and pay up they are somehow no less good citizens. There is some evidence that this attitude is developing towards parking charges in certain parts of cities. People may say, "I'll only get caught one day in 10. How much is the fine? Is it more than 10 times the parking fee? If not, I will probably be no worse off financially if I become a law breaker."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a very unfortunate attitude to be developing in our community, which I believe is very law-abiding, and in difficult economic times—troubled times—it is of inestimable value that a community should be law-abiding. I therefore want to see the Bill framed in a way that will come as near as possible to ensuring that people will comply with its provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the Minister this assurance. No matter how hard I oppose the Bill all the way through the House, when it emerges from the House and becomes law, I shall join him in any appeal to people to comply with its provisions, until such time as we can persuade the Government that it should be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to see a law-abiding community. I hate the idea of having traffic law, or any other law, which is flouted, which falls into disrepute, and which people feel can be set aside with impunity. I attach considerable importance to seeing that if trial areas are run, if the Bill goes through, they are run in ac-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1002</span>
cordance with decisions taken by the majority in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that there can always be difficult cases on enforcement. There may be instances where somebody has failed, unwittingly, to comply in a technical sense only. I should not, therefore, want to see this as a set penalty. It is not a set penalty that I propose, but a maximum fine. The courts will be able to use their discretion as to whether a case is appropriate for a maximum penalty. On those grounds, it would be a great strengthening of the clause, and would also be a great strengthening of the trial area concept as envisaged by the Minister, if he were to accept the amendment and chalk up another to his excellent score today of acceptance of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are doubts about the effectiveness of fines on actions by individuals. Some would argue for stiffer fines and penalties, and others would argue that such methods are frequently counter-productive. Commercial organisations, be they public sector bus operators or private bus operators, could be described as financial organisations. I believe that the level of penalties imposed on organisations that fail to discharge their statutory obligations is piddlingly low—if that word is not out of order, Mr. English—pathetically low. The public regard most fines imposed on organisations—admittedly, in some cases, for .minor breaches of their statutory obligations—as nothing more than a slap on the wrist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might even argue that the increased fines of £500 proposed by the Opposition would be regarded as a slap on the wrist for the National Bus Company, the Nottingham corporation, the Barrow-in-Furness bus company, the Cleveland transit undertaking, or any such organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Maybe we could arrange to go together, Mr. English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am trying to make is that some of these organisations are substantially funded, multi-million pound outfits. To fine them £200 is nothing more than an insult to the population, who do not approve of some large organisation being shuffled into court and being fined a maximum of £200 for what are in some cases, important offences covered by the amendments proposed by my right hon. and hon. Friends. I urge the Committee seriously to consider that the fines set at £200 should be increased to £500, and that those set at £500 should be increased to £1,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bear inflation in mind also. With compound interest, a 7 per cent. increase for 10 years doubles the starting figures. We shall be running at a higher rate of inflation than 7 per cent. So before the Bill becomes law the impact of these £200 fines will be substantially reduced as a result of the inflation which we presently face and which we can confidently or despondently expect to face for a number of years. We should set all these fines at a level which will make the operator, public or private, think twice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one offence is committed and the organisation is taken to court and fined, we want the impact to be sufficiently of a wallop to make the management ensure that it does not happen again. The management must not regard what took the firm to the magistrates' court as a triviality that can be forgotten about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gray Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is much in what has been said about the scale of fines. The size of a fine should always act as a deterrent. One can see the lack of deterrence by the size of some of the fines specified in the Bill. For instance, that specified in clause 24, the suggested fine for an individual who has applied for an operator's licence but fails to notify the commissioners of a conviction
	<span class='label label-info column'>1004</span>
before the date on which the matter is disposed of, is £200. That is not an adequate deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thinks of individuals who are hauled up before the courts because they fail to submit their VAT returns before a set date and are fined £200. It seems to me that an organisation which deals in considerably larger sums should be liable to a fine which is a genuine deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall what my right hon. Friend the Minister said when we were discussing this matter in relation to previous clauses—that fines have to fall into line with other fines under other Acts. But we should not necessarily pay too much attention to unsatisfactory precedents of this kind. We should be talking of this Bill in its own right and what would be adequate deterrents to unacceptable behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my right hon. Friend consider the scale of fines specified in the Bill and think about increasing them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) and with the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). Clearly, it is important that the law is complied with, and that the penalties for the offence mark its seriousness. I am in no doubt about that. Both my hon. Friend and the right hon. Gentleman are right to stress that. Whatever differences there may be between us on the Bill, once it is the law it must be properly complied with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be consistency in the penalties attached to various offences. Public respect for the law would be seriously reduced if that consistency were eroded. I remind the Committee that the Criminal Law Act 1977, which was clearly accepted by the Opposition, sought to iron out the confused levels of maximum fines on summary conviction. They were graded into four new categories, depending on the nature of the offence. The Home Office intends to introduce the power for the Home Secretary to make orders updating the four categories. They are £50, £200, £500 and £1,000. Amendments to the penalties would put the provisions of this Bill out of line with other similar Bills for which the Home Office is—rightly, and follow-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1005</span>
ing the intentions of the House for the Criminal Law Act—acting as a monitoring base.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want that to sound like a bureaucratic reply. It is not intended to be so. Just as there should be a consistency in sentencing policy, there should also be a consistency in the levels of penalties for individuals or companies. One of the bugbears in the law has been the inconsistency over the years. Many of us in the House have argued against that inconsistency and want, for our constituents and the public in general, a greater consistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The summary offences punishable by a maximum fine of £200 are normally those arising from conduct that is, for example, prejudicial to property or to the interests of the community at large, and that comprise a failure to comply with statutory provisions. The £500 maximum penalty is normally reserved for offences involving either a serious element of dishonesty—for example, supplying false particulars in relation to fare changes—or important safety issues. Amendment No. 92 seeks to increase from £200 to £500 the penalty for failing without reasonable excuse to give the local authority, or publish in a local newspaper, a notice describing details of a proposed service or change of service in a trial area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that everything that has come out of the Criminal Law Act 1977, and everything pursued by both Governments to bring about consistency in this area, leads one to conclude that the £200 penalty is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other proposed penalty increases are in the following amendments: No. 145, relating to intentionally obstructing a certifying officer or PSV examiner; No. 147, use of a vehicle without a certificate of fitness—which already carries a fine of £500; No. 190, use of a vehicle without an operator's disc, for which there is a fine of £200; No. 193, failure to inform the traffic commissioners of the relevant conditons, carrying a fine of £200; No. 194, failure to supply traffic commissioners with information about vehicles, which carries a fine of £200; and No. 195, supplying false information about vehicles, where we have rightly marked the seriousness of the offence by replacing the fine of £200 by a £500 fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that what we have done is

In some circumstances, some of those failures could be regarded as dishonest behaviour. I think that my right hon. Friend mentioned that as a general rule there should be a fine of £500 for dishonest behaviour. There is an allowance under subsection (4) for a reasonable excuse.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may discuss at the same time the following:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 9—(	<i>Duty to co-operate in trial areas</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 12—(	<i>Exemption from duty to co-operate in trial areas</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to refer to another offence—failure to advertise, which is mentioned in the consultative document—but as I do not have the document with me I shall check that matter before pursuing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clauses 9 and 12 tackle the same issue—whether some of the duties which the House has laid upon local authorities regarding the operation of road service licences can be held to apply in trial areas. When the legislation referred to in new clause 9—the Transport Act 1968, section 24; the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, section 151; and the Transport Act 1978, sections 1 and 3 —was passed, there was no serious discussion, and no proposition on the horizon at that time, as far as I know, that the duties specified should be operated by local authorities in respect of trial areas as defined in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conditions of free competition, or
	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
as near to it as we are likely to see anyone operating with such services, is it realistic to expect the duties imposed by the present law to continue to apply? We agreed in our previous debate that we did not wish to make nonsense of the law or do anything that might result in a massive measure of non-compliance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it sensible that an operator should be required to give information to a local authority which could, directly or indirectly, use that information to promote a competitive service to the detriment of that operator? Presumably one of the possible ways of assessing whether there is a chance to run a profitable service will be through that kind of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further question is whether it is sensible that the operators who are expected to compete with one another should be required to co-operate with one another. This flows from the legislation. It may be a matter of opinion whether competition or co-operation is in the public interest. The Bill should express clearly whether it is the intention in the trial areas to have co-operation in the public interest and whether indeed it is thought possible that that can be done within the present framework. It seems to me that the Bill tries to back both options and that we can only be on a losing course of action if we leave it in this form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to a few of the simplest examples of the absolute incongruity of the present obligations laid upon local authorities if one examines them from the point of view of trying to apply them in a trial area as defined in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 1 of the Transport Act 1978 lays a duty upon the local authorities in the nine metropolitan counties which will continue to rest upon them in respect of the whole of their area, whether or not all or part of it is a designated trial area. It will remain their duty
	<br><blockquote><p>"acting in consultation with public passenger transport service operators and district councils within the county—
	<ol>
	<li>to develop policies which will promote the provision of a co-ordinated and efficient system of public passenger transport to meet the county's needs, and</li>
	<li>for that purpose to take such steps as the council think appropriate for promoting the co-ordination, amalgamation and re-organisation of road passenger transport undertakings in the county".</li></ol></p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0552">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1009</span>
It will be almost impossible to do that in the trial areas if the effect of designating trial areas is that predicted by the Minister, if it results in people coming in and grabbing such opportunities as they see to run services where they can run them profitably. The Minister may argue that it is in the public interest that they should come in and complete with one another on that basis. But he cannot argue that that situation lends itself to the carrying out of the duties laid upon the authorities by the 1978 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Very similar provisions apply to other authorities under the 1978 Act. Section 3(5) of the Act makes the following requirements for non-metropolitan county councils:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When preparing or revising their plan and deciding whether any, and if so what, agreements should be made under this section, the council may require any of the persons referred to in section 1(5) above to furnish … information".</p></blockquote>
It further provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) the information shall be formulated in such a manner as may be specified in the council's requirement; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>) the council shall, when framing the requirement, have regard to any directions given by the Secretary of State to county councils about the form and content of the information".</p></blockquote>
I put it to the Minister seriously. Is that what he wants to happen in the trial areas? If it is, he should tell the Committee openly tonight that that is what he wishes to happen in the trial areas just as much as in other areas. If that is indeed his position, can he also say that it will facilitate the kind of competition that he holds should be brought about and is desirable in those trial areas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two things will not lie down together. They are not really feasible. We therefore have to reach a decision. One possible decision is that of the new clause now before us. In other words, we could admit in this legislation that it is impossible for the local authorities to carry out the duties laid upon them in the TPP arrangements in respect of the trial areas and that those duties should therefore be lifted. There are other ways, but it is for the Minister to say what they are.
I do not think that the Minister can suggest that these broad policies, these
	<span class='label label-info column'>1010</span>
clear and important objectives, which have been set down by Parliament after long and careful debate about the problems of developing passenger transport, will be able to be applied effectively in the trial areas unless there is a considerable degree of restriction upon the free competition advocated by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to go along with any consistent line because I accept that certain clauses have been carried and certain decisions have been made. We have to debate the remainder of the Bill in Committee on certain assumptions about what will happen in trial areas. However, if the Minister is saying that the trial areas can be run within the disciplines already set out in the clauses and the much wider requirement in the legislation mentioned in the amendment, and that the local authorities will be able to impose them successfully without cutting across those aims of competition, I shall be most interested to see how he suggests that that should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have a decision one way or the other. Either, as the amendment does, we must exempt operators from the general requirements of the law so as to bring about co-operation in the interests of passenger transport in the trial areas, or we must have a clear understanding that these duties still exist. If that is the Minister's intention, we can go on to examine, in the remainder of the Bill, how the aim is to be achieved. It is by no means readily apparent and to many operators it would appear to be impossible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) has made a fair point about this aspect of clause 14. I shall try to precis what we have now. The Transport Act 1968 created the PTAs, the PTEs, the National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group. The PTEs and the National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Group have a duty to cooperate with one another in the reorganisation of bus services and enter into agreements about the services to be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Bus Company, Scottish Transport Group, British Rail and the London Transport Executive have a duty to co-operate in the exercise and performance of their respective functions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1011</span>
for the purpose of co-ordinating their services and to give each other the information reasonably required. That is a brief and rapid summary of some of the effects of the Transport Act 1968.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Transport Act 1978 re-states the duties of shire counties to develop policies to promote a co-ordinated and efficient system of public passenger transport. The county councils, district council and operators have a duty to co-operate with one another for the purpose of co-ordinating public transport services and to give each other information reasonably required. The Act requires county councils to produce an annual public transport plan and to enter into agreements with operators to support services. For this purpose, the councils are given power to require operators to provide information subject to suitable assurances from the county about confidentiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the trial areas we must seek to make a distinction. A distinction must be drawn between the duty of operators to co-operate with each other and exchange information and their duty to co-operate with the county council and provide it with information. Because trial areas clearly mean more competition, as the right hon. Gentleman has suggested, it may be sensible to relieve operators of the duty to co-operate and tell each other what they are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept the force of what the right hon. Gentleman has said on that. We should like to give further thought to it with the intention of seeking to meet his point on Report. I hope that he will accept that as being a firm assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one, however, has proposed to take away the county council's duty to coordinate public transport. That function does not depend on the licensing system. Indeed, the co-ordination responsibility goes beyond bus services and the licensing system. County councils will be able to exercise it in trial areas through discussions with operators and through their powers to make grants. If counties have a duty to co-ordinate the activities of operators, it is reasonable to retain the duty of operators to co-operate with them and to supply information subject to the assurances of confidentiality provided by the Transport Act 1978.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point, therefore, I can and certainly will give a firm assurance
	<span class='label label-info column'>1012</span>
to the right hon. Gentleman. On the second, I must repeat that no one is proposing within the clause to take away the county council's duty to coordinate public transport. That applies to the trial areas as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>POWERS OF, AND FACILITIES FOR INSPECTION OF PUBLIC SERVICE VEHICLES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 14, line 42, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Notwithstanding subsection (1) a certifying officer or public service vehicle examiner shall not detain a public service vehicle which is in service unless he has reason to believe it to be so unfit as to constitute a hazard to its occupants or to other road users.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In subsection (1A), 'in service' means being used on a journey in the course of which it is intended that passengers shall be carried or at a time when the vehicle is proceeding to or is at a point at which passengers may be picked up".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to add two new subsections with a view to removing the power of certifying officers or vehicle examiners to detain for inspection vehicles likely to be carrying passengers or which are proceeding to a pick-up point on a service journey unless those certifying officers or vehicle examiners have reasonable grounds for believing that the condition of the vehicles concerned is such as to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a hazard to its occupants or to other road users."</p></blockquote>
Under the present wording of the Bill, the examiners and certifying officers have the power in the course of their duties to detain vehicles on journeys irrespective of their condition and of whether they are carrying passengers at the time. I believe that there must be some justification for doing that. We can imagine many situations in which it would be most undesirable for an examiner or officer to stop the vehicle unless there were reasonable grounds for doing so. None of us would wish to stop inspectors carrying out their proper duties to inspect vehicles. But where an operator has a first-class record of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1013</span>
always maintaining his vehicles in good order, where he always makes them available for inspection by certifying officers and examiners when requested to do so, where he has been operating for many years and has never been known to have a defective vehicle on the road, it seems unreasonable that power should exist for an examiner to stop a vehicle while it is on its way to pick up passengers and carry out an examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the simple aim behind the amendment. Unless the examiner has some reason to think that the vehicle is defective, he should normally make arrangements to examine the vehicle that will not put the operator in the position of having rapidly to terminate or reorganise a service. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the right hon. Gentleman's desire in moving the amendment is to ensure that services are not interrupted by over-zealous examiners suddenly stopping buses in progress in order to carry out vehicle inspections—spot checks. However, I believe that in practice that is not likely to arise, and that such a restriction is therefore unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the clause stands, a certifying officer has power at any time to inspect a public service vehicle. He may enter the vehicle and detain it during such time as is required for the inspection. This is in line with present practice. I am not aware of any circumstance having arisen of over-zealous inspectors leaping on to buses in the course of their ordinary operation and detaining them. It would be a wholly inappropriate stage at which to exercise their powers, unless there was a compelling reason for thinking that the passengers on the bus were in immediate danger. I do not believe it is necessary to circumscribe the powers in the way suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that the amendment appears slightly illogical, because it reserves to the vehicle examiner or certifying officer the right to detain a public service vehicle, even when in service, when he has reason to believe that there is a hazard to the occupants. I find it difficult to envisage circumstances in which the examiner or certifying officer
	<span class='label label-info column'>1014</span>
can know when passengers face hazard, unless he has carried out some sort of inspection. What would constitute good enough reasons, short of a vehicle inspection, for the officer to move in I am not sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The examiner might have heard rumours or received anonymous information that the bus was dangerous, but my main reaction is that this is an unnecessary and somewhat lengthy proviso for dealing with a circumstance in which the Department's officers and operators are ever likely to be involved. If the right hon. Gentleman has, in the course of his consultations about the Bill, been given specific examples of the Department's officers being over-zealous or so carried away in enthusiasm for their powers that they are causing inconvenience to passengers, I shall be prepared to look at individual cases and see that steps are taken within the Department to make sure that certifying officers and vehicle examiners use their powers sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that here we are being asked to legislate to cover circumstances which in practice do not arise, are not likely to arise and are wholly fanciful. I suggest that the amendment is unnecessary, quite apart from the difficulties in interpretation that it might give rise to in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could have used the first part of the Parliamentary Secretary's argument as an argument for the amendment. The second part raises a facet of the amendment upon which I did not touch but which is equally valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we carry the amendment, it carries with it the implication that if an examiner or certifying officer has reason to believe that there is a vehicle on the road in such a condition that it might be dangerous for passengers and other road users, he should stop the vehicle. I think that that helps my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of ways in which experienced examiners may form a view that a vehicle may be in a dangerous condition. There are a number of ways in which they may be informed that a vehicle is in a dangerous state. In those conditions it is quite right that they should stop the vehicle on the road. I admit that it is an inconvenience to the operator and to the passengers on board, but the safety of those occupants and other road users must take precedence
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1015</span>
over convenience to the operator, or even the temporary inconvenience to other people upon the route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is valid. It does not require me to show that the Minister has numbers of over-zealous inspectors waiting to pounce upon law-abiding operators and their drivers to stop them from running their services. Far from it; I have a considerable respect for the Department's inspectorate. In fact, I should prefer the inspectorate to be strengthened, not weakened, in present circumstances. I do not want my remarks to be taken as necessarily referring only to passenger vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, the Minister has made no case against the amendment. He has admitted that it does not stop his</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>inspectors doing their job. It would carry the implication that in certain circumstances they should do a job to which—I take it—he would not object. I take it that he would not want the amendment to be rejected in a way which would suggest to anyone reading the 	<i>Official Report</i> of our debates that he did not want to prevent inspectors from stopping vehicles which appeared to be in an unsafe condition. So I believe that everything is in favour of our carrying the amendment.</p>

	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>premises as official PSV testing stations. I know that there is concern about the matter. That concern is shared, among others, by the National Bus Company, which wants some indications of the Government's intentions about the designation of official stations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments draw attention to three criteria which might apply. The first is whether the stations could include premises owned or occupied by a bus operator. The second is whether it should contain the prescribed equipment. The third is whether we can designate a particular station as a place where the operator's own vehicles can be tested. I propose to give a general indication of what we have in mind. I believe that all the operators' requirements can be met under the Bill as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first and most important point, which I think will be welcome news to those with whom Opposition Members have, clearly, been in contact in drafting the amendments that there is absolutely nothing in clause 15, as it stands, to prevent the designation of an operators' premises as an official PSV testing station. When discussions get under way about the system that we shall adopt to designate testing stations, we contemplate that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1017</span>
system will include some operators' stations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment seeks to require that we should designate stations where the necessary equipment is installed. I invite the Committee not to seek to write that provision into the Bill. Clearly, it will be essential that the necessary equipment be installed. That will be a precondition that the Minister will look for. But that is not the sole criterion on which we shall judge whether to designate a station. Other matters—mainly geographical convenience and location—will have to be taken into consideration. It is conceivable that we may find—as we found in the case of MOT testing for private vehicles—that in one or two very remote parts of the country the equipment requirements may have to be relaxed slightly.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Birmingham.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not Birmingham. In Birmingham and other more populous centres, of course, we intend to apply the full rigours of the equipment requirements and the law, but in one or two places it may be necessary to relax the requirements slightly in order to enable someone to set up a station which can sensibly be designated. I wish to leave that possibility open.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 165 raises the question of designating a station which is owned by an operator but will be used for the purpose of testing the operator's own vehicles. That possibility is left open under the Bill, but we would prefer that, where an operator's own premises are designated as a testing station, it should be possible for other operators' vehicles to be tested at the same station. Otherwise, bearing in mind the geographical distribution of stations and so on, it would be possible for the dominant operator in one area to have his own premises designated as a testing station and force all his smaller competitors to travel very great distances to the nearest testing station elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are very ready to discuss all these matters. There have been preliminary and fairly informal talks between myself and the NBC—my right hon. Friend is fully acquainted with the situation too—and we see no likely clash of interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have given a clear general indication of policy. I assure hon. Gentlemen that we actually expect operators' premises
	<span class='label label-info column'>1018</span>
to be among the designated testing stations. Indeed, we have no objection in principle to all the designated stations being operators' premises if that were practicable, which it may not be. All the matters encompassed by the amendments are already contemplated by the wording of the clause as it stands. I trust therefore that these amendments will be treated as probing amendments and that no one will feel a need to press for their inclusion in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary's contribution has gone some way towards meeting the concern of a considerable number of Operators who have read the Bill. It seems to me that no harm would be done, and much good would result, if the Minister accepted some of these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that an operator had gone to the trouble of installing the appropriate equipment on his own premises for the purpose of testing his own vehicles, it would be ridiculous if the Minister refused to designate his premises and insisted that he take his buses to some designated centre 30, 40, 50 or 60 miles away. Some regard must be paid to the willingness of certain good operators to install on their premises proper testing equipment for their own vehicles. I imagine that, if the Minister has consulted his inspectors, they will have told him that they would be very happy with such an arrangement. I see no reason why amendment No. 165 should not be accepted. I would suggest that it would be a quite unnecessary waste of resources to install the prescribed testing equipment if the Minister were to deny the operator the chance of having it used to test his own vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the first reason why I think the Minister is being very cautious. But it would certainly be within the spirit of what he has said if he accepted that part of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other statement the Minister made in relation to these amendments worries me more. He has said that if he designates an operator's premises as being suitable for testing his own vehicles, that will be only in circumstances where he allows other operators' vehicles to be tested on the same premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the Minister was the apostle of competition, yet he is denying a competitive advantage to an operator who is prepared to set up good and valid
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0557">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1019</span>
equipment to have his own vehicles tested. From his standpoint, surely that is an unreasonable proposition. It may be part of a county council's duty to promote some co-operation, but I should not have thought it was the duty of Conservative Ministers to try to drive through the House Bills that require one operator to provide facilities for other operators with whom he is competing. Therefore, I believe that the matter is unacceptable.

I hope that we shall later be able to frame an amendment that will remove completely from the Bill any possibility of the Minister's designating test stations on that basis. He would be able to say to an operator "Your premises with good and valid equipment can be used to test your vehicles and have them certified by my officers, provided you make them available to other operators as well." I should like to know the premise on which that is based. Even those who believe in Socialist co-operation do not think that it should be rammed down the throats of private operators in competition with one another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I attempted to be reassuring, but plainly I was not at my best. Admittedly, I had not then heard the points, but I thought that I had met any which would arise. However, I could see what was contemplated from the drift of the amendments. I believed that I had covered all the matters that had so far been put to me by operators, including the NBC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the first amendment is unnecessary. As the Opposition have been so helpful in improving the Bill's drafting, I cannot see why they need to put in two lines of wording that do not add anything to the meaning. What is in the amendment is already encompassed perfectly adequately by the wording of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment would restrict matters to a basis of designation purely on the suitability of the equipment. That is not the only criterion which we shall apply. As I said, it would not deal with the problems of the remote areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third amendment, concerning a matter which so upsets the right hon. Gentleman, gives rise to the problem whether a designated station should be open only to the vehicles of the operator whose premises it is, or to those of other
	<span class='label label-info column'>1020</span>
operators as well. We believe in competition, but it must be fair and open. When there is a Government requirement that vehicles must be inspected at a designated centre, we do not want that used by any operator to steal a march on his competitors, particularly those which are smaller and newer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not inconceivable that a dominant operator in an area, faced with one or two newcomers to the business, would designate a station at which only his vehicles were tested, thereby obliging the "min-nows" to travel great distances to other testing centres. We do not intend to impose an obligation on an operator. I imagine that he would charge for the facility of opening up the designated test station to other operators' vehicles. I do not see why he should be obliged to do that at no cost to themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want a proper network of official PSV testing stations. We believe that many of those will be at premises which are those of bus operators. There is nothing in the amendments that would add to the Bill or that needs to be pressed to meet operators' legitimate interests, which I am sure will be accommodated in our policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take new clause 10—(	<i>Annual inspection of public service vehicles</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be reasonably brief. To a large extent the clause speaks for itself. However, if we go into the matter of testing, we should lay down a regular period. The Minister's notes refer to regular inspection, such as of cars and heavy goods vehicles. If we see fit to test cars and heavy goods vehicles on a regular basis logic dictates that we should lay down a regular basis for public service vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes add that the Minister established, from sources unknown, that normally public service vehicles are examined every 12 to 18 months, as resourses permit. If the matter is so urgent that we decide that inspections should take place, can the Minister in all honesty suggest that 12 to 18 months is a suitable period, subject to resources
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1021</span>
permitting. Subject to resources permitting rules out the 12 to 18 months. In some areas the period could be two years. All we ask in the new clause is that we lay down some conformity in testing, and stipulate an annual requirement. We understand that under EEC regulations that may be a requirement by January 1983. If so, why does not the Minister beat that by accepting the new clause and laying down such a regulation, so that we are at least putting some teeth in the powers to test vehicles, otherwise there is no point in testing vehicles at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) I strongly support new clause 10. The Parliamentary Secretary said on Second Reading that he completely rejected suggestions that safety was threatened. He said that such suggestions were absolute nonsense, and that if anything the Bill would improve the safety arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In tabling this new clause we are fulfilling his desires and designs by providing an improvement in the present testing arrangements. We understand that the present tests are carried out at intervals of 12 to 18 months, depending on the availability of resources. We are all well aware that resources in these spheres are likely to be subjected to pressure for reduction, and the ready way to reduce expenditure, both in money and manpower, is to extend the period by a month here and a month there, until the present arrangements are severely eroded. Provision for a regular 12-monthly inspection can only be of benefit to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many amendments have been suggested by the various transport undertakings, and organisations representing them, some could be interpreted as being in the interests of the transport organisations, and possibly some of them as not so much in the interests of the travelling public. However, this new clause is one proposal which the organisations representing the public passenger transport industry strongly support. In those circumstances we should encourage them in this effort to improve safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor should we depend exclusively on the prospect of EEC regulations. For all we know, with a bit of luck, Government hon. Members and particularly the Prime Minister, might see the light and decide
	<span class='label label-info column'>1022</span>
that if the Government do not get a concession from the Common Market we shall withdraw from the whole stinking rotten shambles, and then we would have no regulations at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister wants an Act which will work for some time in the future. Therefore, for the purpose of enhancing the safety of public passenger transport, we need the 12-monthly inspection. I cannot believe that the Parliamentary Secretary, with all his charm and wit, can come up with a satisfactory rebuttal of the case for regular 12-monthly inspections demanded by statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing clause stand part and I understand that there is no controversy inside or outside of the Committee about the powers and facilities for inspection of public vehicles to contain that. It is a welcome feature of all discussions on passenger road transport that everybody places great emphasis upon the safety of the passenger. All the representations from the operators to the Government, and, apparently, to the Opposition, have stressed the need for the highest possible standards of safety in the interests of the travelling public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not try to rebut the case for annual inspection of vehicles. It is the policy of the Government to move to such an annual system and that will be done in the near future. In fact, it is a requirement of an EEC roadworthiness directive that all vehicles must be tested in accordance with its requirements by 1 January 1983 and that means starting to test vehicles by 1 January 1982. In order to allow full consultation with industry, detailed regulations therefore need to be prepared this year. I have heard the arguments of hon. Gentlemen and accepting what they said, it seems that the best way to deal with that matter from a parliamentary point of view is to take powers in the Bill to require annual inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just in case the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) feels so strongly about the EEC that he is almost tempted to vote against annual inspections because that is an EEC requirement, let me reassure him that it so happens that we would implement that policy regardless of the EEC directive. If it makes the hon. Gentleman happier, we may regard that as British legislation for a British change that happens to coincide with an EEC directive.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1023</span>
I should therefore like to conclude my speech by saying that I would happily accept new clause 10 but I am afraid that as it stands it is slightly defective. It is confined to public service vehicles whereas we propose to bring forward a similar requirement for all large passenger vehicles, whether public service vehicles or not. We shall bring forward the necessary amendments in the course of the Committee's proceedings on the Bill and suitable Government amendments will be presented to meet the points made to us by hon. Gentlemen on the other side of the Committee. I expect that the right point
	<span class='label label-info column'>1024</span>
will be found in part IV of the Bill, but I give an undertaking to the two hon. Gentlemen who pressed the matter that we shall bring forward a suitable amendment to meet the tenor of their remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
