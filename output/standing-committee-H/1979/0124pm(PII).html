	<section>
	<div class='title'>PUBLIC SERVICE VEHICLES: CONDITIONS AFFECTING STATUS OR CLASSIFICATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 68, in page 49, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"1. The number of passengers carried must not exceed five."</p></q>
The amendment is eminently reasonable, but raises serious issues. It arises because the provision in clause 2(2) allows that:
	<br><q><p>"A vehicle carrying passengers at separate fares in the course of a business of carrying passengers, but doing so in circumstances in which the conditions set out in Part I, II or III of Schedule 1 are fulfilled, shall be treated as not being a public service vehicle unless it is adapted to carry more than eight passengers."</p></q>
From that, it is clear that part I of the schedule is dealing with vehicles that are not public service vehicles provided that they carry no more than eight passengers. That is a different provision from the present law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) will deal later with the limitations in existing legislation in respect of the pursuit of a business on a hire-car basis. He will also make known our view on the unreality of grouping taxis and hire cars in the proposal. Although they may be covered in theory, taxis are subject, in practice, to other legislation. Therefore the two cannot be considered as comparable in the terms of part I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taxis of course operate at fixed fares and generally carry no more than five passengers in the provinces and four in London. Our amendment is designed to get a serious response from the Government to the problem of the unequal relationship
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>560</span>
that will be created between taxis and hire cars by passing the Bill and schedule in their present forms. Without developing the argument at this stage, I merely state that we are close to the position where it will become impossible to have a sensible business relationship between the two types of passenger service if the law is extended to such an extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I readily acknowledge that the Labour Government moved some distance in this direction in their legislation. However, they always put a limit on the number that could be carried in the course of a car hire business. The point that I wish to raise, which will supplement and underlie the main argument that will be developed, concerns the effect of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of part I on the new position that will arise as a result of applying the provision to hire cars. I reiterate that it cannot apply to taxis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new situation arises because existing provisions are being greatly widened—we are not talking of an increase of one in the number of passengers, but of doubling to eight the number of passengers who can be carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second direct question, given that eight can be carried under the Bill as framed, is, who will initiate the agreement which part I clearly envisages. Part I states:
	<br><q><p>"The making of the agreement for the payment of separate fares must not have been initiated by the driver"—</p></q>
That is clear and specific and no one can complain about lack of clarity in the drafting of the schedule—
	<br><q><p>"or by the owner of the vehicle, by any person who has made the vehicle available or by any person"—</p></q>
who is presumably not the driver-owner or a person who can make the vehicle available under an arrangement—
	<br><q><p>"who receives any remuneration in respect of the arrangements for the journey."</p></q>
Our question is relevant and justified. Who does the Minister say is to initiate the arrangements under the agreement for payment of the separate fare?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another specific, clear and relevant question concerns the background of the argument on the amendment. How do passengers know of the availability of the service under this provision? The Minister will accept, no doubt, that the journeys that we are discussing have to be made without previous advertisement of the facilities to the public. In fact, the schedule states:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>561</span>
	<br><q><p>"The journey must be made without previous advertisement to the public of facilities for its being made by passengers to be carried at separate fares."</p></q>
That, I admit, throws some doubt on the scope of advertising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Surely the amendment is concerned simply with the number of passengers carried. The right hon. Gentleman is talking about who initiates the arrangements, advertising and so on. Can that possibly be in order under this rather limited amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the right hon. Gentleman. It is a fairly narrow amendment, but, in my judgment, so far he is giving his arguments in favour of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to you, Mr. English, and to the Committee if I have not made clear the relevance of my argument to the law that allows a business to be carried on, using a vehicle that is not a public service vehicle carrying up to eight passengers under a provision which never previously existed in law. I suggest that, previously, the law, in so far as it contained such provisions, was not concerned with vehicles of this character. In fact, there was a definition in a previous law that if vehicles were to be used under such provisions they could not be used in the course of a business if they carried more than four passengers. I suggest that a much wider range of vehicles may be involved in future, together with a much wider scope for passenger carrying. That makes my questions relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the right hon. Gentleman is clear about what he is arguing. I realise that the meaning of the provision is not immediately apparent and that I have the advantage of having looked at it and the background briefing beforehand. This part is concerned with arrangements where passengers in a taxi share the fare amongst themselves. It relates only to taxis and hire cars and is merely distinguishing the position where people get into a taxi and agree to make one journey and share the fare among themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the provisions about which the right hon. Gentleman is worried are designed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>562</span>
only to ensure that the driver of the taxi or anyone with a financial interest in it, such as the owner of the business, do not make the passengers share the fare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken at length, but it has been necessary. We are concerned only with the situation in which a number of people get into a taxi and agree to share the fare amongst themselves. The Bill merely makes clear that that arrangement does not make the taxi a public service vehicle and that it will not therefore require a road service licence. The right hon. Gentleman apparently wants to restrict the right of passengers to make sharing arrangements to a situation where there are no more than five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Committee by reminding it of a ruling I gave earlier when both sides of the Committee asked, on a point of order, whether it would be acceptable to discuss certain general points under schedule 1 which had not so far arisen on clause 3. Both sides of the Committee seemed to regard it as acceptable that these general points would be in order on a clause stand part debate. I hope that, in view of what has just been said, the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), in developing his arguments, will bear that in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary's intervention to my speech was a most ingenious one, which sought to hide completely the very important difference between the provisions in previous legislation, which restricted it to hire cars on business operations which could not carry four people, and the position under this Bill, which I said at the start was only governed and limited by subsection (3) of clause 2, which enables any vehicles operating under conditions herein to run without being subject to public service vehicle requirements. So I disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make clear to you, Mr. Dean, and appeal to you, that the meaning is not nearly as narrow as the Parliamentary Secretary suggests. If you do not accept that, I make the further submission that, whilst this provision is written in a way which suggests that it applies equally to the sharing of taxis and hire cars, it cannot in reality bear that meaning, because the use of the taxi is governed by Home Office regulations and bye laws in such a way that it would not ever be used for carrying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>563</span>
eight passengers to a series of places, which can happen under the Bill's provisions. So it is a different matter, but one that I do not wish to develop, preferring to leave it to others who have studied it more carefully than I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. May I draw your attention to the fact that the whole purpose of part I of the schedule is to exclude from the Bill taxis and hire cabs which are not the subject of separate legislation? There is a danger that taxis and hire cabs would be included in circumstances where passengers pay separate fares, which is part of the definition of "stage carriage".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This makes clear that it does not matter if the passengers pay separate fares so long as the arrangement is made among the passengers themselves. For that reason, the meaning of part I and of the amendment is that we are talking about the number of passengers in a taxi who can agree to divide the fare amongst themselves on their own initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not being ingenious, and I assure the right hon. Gentleman that I am not misleading him. That is all the amendment does. He is saying that the number of passengers in a taxi or hire car who agree to share the fare should be limited to five. As the Bill stands, it would be limited to eight. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that that is the only effect of his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to rule on the substance of the wording in the schedule. I think that we would proceed more satisfactorily if the right hon. Gentleman were to develop his arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first withdraw my reference to the Minister's intervention being ingenious? In the light of what he just said that might have been unfair, and I withdraw it unreservedly. Moreover, I shall not challenge what he says about the purpose. I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary is sincere, and if he tells me that that was his purpose, I accept it. But I am arguing that the effect, or legal possibilities, that will be brought about by a combination of clause 2(3) with part I of schedule 1, are such as to make relevant three questions I am seeking to put to the Minister, which I believe are a background to the major argument on the merits of having taxis or hire cars—my concern is particularly with hire cars—used
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>564</span>
in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a change in the law, and at least there is no difference between the Parliamentary Secretary and myself on the contention that it will be possible for hire cars to be used on a separate fare basis with up to eight passengers. That does not arise under present legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question is, who can initiate agreements? Secondly, how do the passengers know of the availability of the service, because the advertising limitations prevent anyone advertising that the service is available? That is a very apt question in view of the action now before the courts arising from persistent touting. My final question arises from paragraph 3 of the schedule. How else can a vehicle be used that is being used for this purpose? Paragraph 3 states:
	<br><q><p>"The journey must not be made in conjunction with, or in extension of, a service provided under a road service licence"—</p></q>
It is clear and, I hope, obvious, that this is not an adjunct to road service licence operating—
	<br><q><p>"if the vehicle is owned by, or made available under any arrangement with, the holder of the licence or any person who receives any remuneration in respect of the service provided under it or in respect of arrangements for that service."</p></q>
In deciding the merits of the proposition, it is relevant to have answers to those questions. If a vehicle is being used for this purpose, given the limitations of paragraph 3, how else can it be used—or is it a vehicle that must be used exclusively for this purpose?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I leave to my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East the question of the merits of opening up such a service on that basis for twice as many people as hitherto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to clarify what the amendments are about. I think I shall be able to reassure the right hon. Gentleman on the issues he has raised. It is not easy, as I said, to arrive at the purpose of part I of schedule 1. It would help everybody if I indicated how one arrives at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This all relates to clause 2, and only clause 2. Clause 2 gives the definition of a public service vehicle. A public service vehicle is one which will carry eight passengers, but that does not concern us here. A vehicle with one driver and eight passengers or less is only a public service
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>565</span>
vehicle if it is used for hire or reward and, in clause 2(1)(	<i>a</i>), if it
	<br><q><p>"is so used to carry passengers at separate fares in the course of a business of carrying passengers".</p></q>
When we debated clause 2, we agreed that that normally excludes taxis. Taxis do not normally carry passengers at separate fares. Nor do hire cars. The vehicle is hired as a whole, and there are no separate fares. Therefore, the purpose of clause 2(1)(	<i>a</i>) is to exclude taxis from the definition of public service vehicles. But that does not exclude taxis from the law. The right hon. Gentleman correctly said that there is considerable law surrounding taxis which is the responsibility of the Home Office, and is also very carefully prescribed by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is desirable that this legislation, and the legislation covering public service vehicles and buses, should not overlap that applying to taxis. Hence, the definition in clause 2(1)(	<i>a</i>) is designed to exclude taxis and hire cars from our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are certain circumstances, with which most Members of Parliament are familiar, in which a taxi will carry passengers at separate fares. Often three or four Members of Parliament at the end the day's sitting pile into a taxi and agree to divide the fare amongst themselves. The driver cannot ask them to divide the fare. The owners of the taxi cannot advertise a service of carrying at separate fares. However, if the passengers agree among themselves to share the fare, that is travelling at separate fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Committee has followed me so far, although I see that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) is looking puzzled. That taxi is carrying passengers at separate fares. I hope we all agree that it is desirable that legally run taxis should not be within this legislation. Therefore, that has to be covered to make clear that it is outside this legislation. That is the sole purpose of part I of the schedule as I understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we must ensure is that, as a result of that practice, a loophole is not opened in the law whereby certain Hackney carriage licence holders set up a business which is in competition on small vehicles with stage carriage services, buses, and so on, by only picking up passengers who will agree to share taxis, only picking up passengers who will agree to share the fare, or setting set fares to different passengers in the same cab depending on how far they wish to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>566</span>
travel, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result is that, to make clear that where a vehicle with eight passengers or less is travelling at separate fares, it can still not be a public service vehicle where the criteria set out in part I of the schedule are satisfied. Hence, this schedule makes clear that any agreement to travel at separate fares must be initiated by the passengers themselves. The driver of a taxi is not entitled to drive into a station and organise a group of passengers to divide the fares. A traveller at the head of a queue for taxis is entitled to the next available taxi. He does not have to share it with anyone. The taxi driver is obliged to take that passenger to wherever the passenger stipulates. Therefore, if the driver starts organising separate fares he needs a PSV licence and possibly a road service licence, if he is not careful, because he is running a stage carriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies if the owner advertises. We must make sure that people do not fiddle—and we have agreed throughout the debates that people do fiddle in the taxi and hire car area. If the proprietor, or someone who has a hire purchase interest in the taxi, or some shadowy backer, initiates or advertises arrangements whereby people can travel at separate fares in taxis, that moves him straight into the ambit of our legislation. That would make him a public service vehicle operator, and once he starts advertising services at separate fares he needs a road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, this part, in order to make sure that it is covered by taxi legislation, is exempting from our legislation, the arrangement whereby the passengers in a taxi choose to divide up the fare among themselves. Having heard the right hon. Gentleman I realise that he is not supporting the effect of his amendment. He is exploring and this is a probing amendment. The effect of his amendment would only take a taxi outside the ambit of the Bill if the number of passengers did not exceed five. The result is that one might have a taxi that was constructed to carry eight passengers and if five passengers piled in and agreed to share the fare that would be all right. But if six, seven or eight passengers got in and agreed to divide the fare and if the right hon. Gentleman's amendment were carried that would be illegal and that sort of case would have to go back to the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I anticipate hon. Members rising to say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>567</span>
that very few taxis or hire cars carry six, seven or eight passengers in a taxi is dangerous. Let me make it clear that we are making sure that taxis remain governed by taxi legislation. Over the vast majority of the country there are restrictions on the number of people who may travel in a taxi—it is four in London, but the number varies in local authority areas. The schedule has no effect whatever on that and that will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that there are a very few areas in the country where the policy of the local authorities and the police are such that there are no tight restrictions on numbers, and vehicles are used as taxis that are constructed to carry more than four or five passengers. If that is wrong that can be dealt with under separate legislation for which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is responsible. We believe that we should continue to exclude these taxis from our legislation when the passengers agree to divide up the fare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that sheds light on that matter. It is obvious that the Opposition did not intend this, but they are simply arguing about whether there should be a limit on the number of passengers in a taxi who have agreed to divide the fare amongst themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether I agree with him or not, the Parliamentary Secretary usually clarifies matters. But I am now much more confused about separate fares than ever I have been in the past. It seems that the circumstances he described were of people clubbing together to pay a fare. There is a distinction between three or four people jumping into a vehicle and saying "We will split the fare between us" and circumstances where one might get into that vehicle with another person and hand over one's fare as one left the taxi, and the other person will pay the fare for the remainder of the journey. I see those as separate fares but I do not see these hypothetical Members of Parliament paying separate fares. I see them as clubbing together to pay a fare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes I need to borrow money from my wife to pay a taxi fare and vice versa, of course. It seems to me that we are not paying separate fares but are clubbing together our family funds to pay the enormous rates now charged. That seems at variance with the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>568</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is conceivable that if it is organised in that way the hon. Gentleman is right. Separate fares are important to the root of what I have said. The difference between a taxicab and a hire car is that one hires the vehicle. Separate fares means that each passenger pays a fare for his journey. I agree that if we all leap into a taxi with the hon. Gentleman and he collects subscriptions from us and he pays the driver, he is probably hiring the vehicle. It is conceivable that each passenger may be paying different amounts at different stages, but so long as that does not add up to more than the total fare, and if that is an agreement initiated by the passengers, we make clear that that is outside the scope of this legislation. I think that the hon. Gentleman brought out that we are dealing with only a limited number of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I hope that I have satisfied the Committee that if the amendment is carried, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Boscawen) has just pointed out, the Liberal Party will be most unfairly dealt with the next time it travels home from this House because it slightly exceeds the maximum laid down by the amendment and will find that the taxi requires a road service licence, if it starts dividing up the fare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I thought that it would be helpful to the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), when moving his amendment, and to the Minister, to go somewhat wide to have—in effect, a clause stand part debate on the schedule. I must point out to the Committee that we are now on a very narrow amendment which seeks to add the words:
	<br><q><p>"The number of passengers carried must not exceed five".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a suggestion to you on this point Mr. Dean? The Minister has made no reference to my main contention that the provision as drafted is not restricted to the use of taxis.

realise that this is a matter for argument rather than a ruling from the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly bear in mind the very valid points that you made, Mr. Dean. It may seem to be a very narrow amendment, but when the Minister was presenting his argument we were agreeing at each stage with his interpretation of what it meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was not following through the implications of what the numbers game meant in the sense that we are saying that that should be limited to five. I shall cut out references to other pieces of legislation relevant to the point since schedules are being changed in other pieces of legislation. We are agreed that we are dealing with taxis and hire cars, and definition has proved to be one of the difficulties. I normally think of the ordinary hackney cab as a taxi, but an enormous range of vehicles go under the name of taxi from mini buses down. However, the only restriction in the legislation is that the vehicle should not carry more than eight passengers—I believe the figure would be nine with the driver—and where there is a shared fare not initiated by the driver but at the instigation of the passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not relate to car sharing, as we know from clause 2(2)—it is for those actually involved in the course of business. The difficulty for us with this, as with past legislation, is that the meaning of "the course of business" has not been made clear, nor, as we know from the courts, has the definition of hire for reward or profit. But a limit of four in the numbers carried under hackney cab legislation, which I believe is the case in London, may be followed or not in various areas outside London and may be varied to five, or there may be miscellaneous local authority legislation which gives powers to authorities to impose some sort of licensing on private hire cars. So there is no doubt about what vehicles we are talking about in the Committee, nor about the interpretation of the practice of initiating car sharing. Therefore, both sides of the Committee agree on the interpretation of the vehicle and the action involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to limit the number of passengers to five. From what was said by the Parliamentary Secretary, there is no doubt that under this provision any car must now be limited to five passengers. So if eight people, or eight
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>570</span>
Members of Parliament, wanted to share a taxi, they would be prevented from doing so under this provision. The effect of the amendment would be limited to people wishing to share a taxi or hire car on the basis of the arrangement that we have agreed is the proper interpretation of this legislation. The number of passengers would be limited by the amendment to five. If the Government's proposal is accepted as it stands, eight people could pile into a car and come to a sharing arrangement among themselves. The distinction between five and eight is crucial. The legislation proposes that it should be eight. The Opposition believe that it should be five. As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, the amendment has a restrictive effect—whether on the Liberal Party or not, I leave for others to judge. At least we are clear in our minds about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was essentially a probing amendment to ascertain exactly what the provisions mean. Even the very good and useful notes on clauses have difficulty putting the exact point across. That may not be the view of those who drafted them, and I intend no slur whatever, as I found them very useful. Nevertheless, it took a few readings as well as listening to the debate to understand what was meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a basic point of the Opposition's case that the number of passengers in a car is a commercial consideration. We do not wish to create unfair competition among those who are competing for the same traffic. We have agreed that we are talking about business cars and people who ply for hire and reward. Taxis may do that, although for private hire cars certain other conditions are laid down. In other words, we are referring to those in competition for the business of the five or eight people who wish to share a car. Clearly, in the case of the ordinary hackney cab, eight people would have to use two cabs. But under the Bill eight people could share a single car, or large car or minibus or whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That begins to undermine one section of the cars that are involved in business, namely, hackney cabs and private hire cars. They are put at a distinct disadvantage as compared with those who will be able to use this provision to make a fair sharing arrangement for up to eight. It could be argued that in some parts of the country there is at present no limit on the number of people who may share a private hire car, unless the local authority imposes restric-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>571</span>
tions. I understand that some authorities in this country in a number of areas which together are as large as the whole of Wales impose no restrictions whatever on private hire. Others may impose limitations on seating and so on, or they may not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our basic argument is that small business people—the very people whom the Conservative Party seeks to represent, and I think that we, too, were playing around with the idea in the later stages of the Labour Government—would be affected by unfair competition as a result of the Government's proposal. We are dealing here with the area of business. It is no longer a question of social car ownership or Jack going along and taking five others with him. We believe that that will undermine the cab trade anyway, but I leave that aside for the purposes of this argument. I speak only of the business sector, of taxis and private hire. If our amendment No. 5, or at least the idea behind it, were accepted, it would put the matter on a fair competitive basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of your ruling, Mr. Dean, I have not dealt with the distinctive qualifications and extra costs involved with regard to hackney cabs. But I think that the principle is clear. The Minister said in part answer to that aspect of the argument that any change in those matters is not a matter for his Department. If London cabs required a limit of five or eight, the Home Office would have to change the regulations for which it is responsible. In the provinces, local authority provisions would have to be changed. That argument would be more convincing if there had not just been a debate on provisions about education buses which the Minister honestly admitted had been drafted in line with what was being done in another piece of legislation currently before the House. Another Department was involved there. This involves a necessary part of transport policy. In that case, apparently, the Ministry of Transport got together with the Department of Education and Science and brought the two things together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the principle has been breached and the Minister has looked at the consequential effects of this legislation on other aspects of transport in another Department, it is a great pity that he did not look a little further to see whether it affected taxis and, if it did, whether he should not recommend to the Home Office an increase from four to five. On a previous amend-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>572</span>
ment, which was not accepted, we sought to argue that it should be changed from four to five. We were told then that it would be no great step for mankind—no massive leap, to use the Minister's words—to go from four to five. But clearly it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to stem the hon. Gentleman's flow of words, but I should like to put a question to him. I have been trying hard to follow the debate on this complex matter. I hope that I have understood it so far. If I understood the Minister aright, in some areas of the country present regulations may permit even taxis to carry up to eight passengers. That being so, whether it be by charging separate fares or whatever, is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that in the future, as a result of his amendment, those taxi operators will be prevented from carrying eight people if they voluntarily agree to share a fare? Surely that is not his intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an interpretation of our amendment. We are exploring this matter and trying to bring out the basic principle. In the clause as drafted, there is a disadvantage the other way. The hon. Gentleman asks why a taxi driver should be denied the possibility of putting eight people into a car if that is the existing principle in his area. Certainly, that is involved in the argument about whether it should be five or eight. It is unfortunate that not all local authorities have imposed some kind of taxi control. Parliament passed legislation to enable local authorities, if they so wished, to endorse that principle. Yet in a number of areas which together constitute a mass as large as Wales, there are no regulations whatever. To that extent, I believe that there should be a standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment merely seeks to provide that for all those covered by some form of regulation there should be a limit on the number of passengers they may carry. Presumably those regulations are made for reasons of safety. The argument given in relation to London taxi cabs is that the number cannot be increased from four to five because it would make the taxi cab less safe. The fact that all kinds of cars, Minis included, will now be careering around with God knows how many people inside them because there is no control is a matter that we have dealt with previously. In the area of business, however, the number of people carried becomes an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>573</span>
essential consideration for obvious reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill extends the limit for private cars to eight this will seriously disadvantage the other area of the taxi trade which is limited to four passengers in London or five in the provinces. Taxi drivers and owners have constantly complained that that situation is one of unfair competition. It is strange that the Opposition should have to argue the case about unfair competition. If the Government have embarked on a policy of concern for the small business man, they should not disadvantage the regular professional taxi operator by allowing other people to carry up to eight passengers when taxis are limited by other laws and regulations to four or five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the difficulties about schedule 1 is this. The heading of part I of the schedule reads:
	<br><q><p>"Sharing of Taxis and Hire-Cars".</p></q>
The Conservatives for a long time have stood for the policy of fair competition. But this provision is open-ended. The Parliamentary Secretary spoke of eight-seater taxis. The National Federation of Taxi Owners and Drivers does not agree. It says that the regulation in London is four, and in the provinces it is five. Nowhere is it more than five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has met the National Federation of Taxi Owners and Drivers. If he has some information about eight-seater taxis, I should be pleased to hear it. So, no doubt, would the National Federation of Taxi Owners and Drivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties is that two Departments deal with the same thing. The heading is
	<br><q><p>"Sharing of Taxis and Hire-Cars".</p></q>
The Home Office deals with that. I do not wish to go down the avenue of why that is so, or why it should be changed. The Home Office could be right, it could be wrong. In my opinion it is wrong on a number of issues. Nevertheless, the Home Office makes the regulations. In London the limit is four, and in the provinces five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule is unbelievably open-ended. It makes no regulation as to whether the car is capable of carrying that number of passengers. There is nothing at all on the subject. We shall leave aside for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>574</span>
the moment the question of the fitness of the driver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the Government stand for fair competition. We are told that they are the supporters of small business men, like many taxi owners. If so, how can they initiate a situation so favourable to unfair competition? I shall imagine that I am a London taxi driver governed by regulations that admittedly are laid down not by the Ministry of Transport but by the Home Office. I can only take four people in my taxi. If I take a chance and take more, I am breaking the law. Under the proposed legislation, if I went out in something other than a taxi I should have unlimited scope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Home Office arguments for having a limit of four or five? Surely they are ruled by the safety considerations. In that case, how can we logically argue that it is right to give a blank cheque? If safety reasons dictate a limit of four or five in the taxi service, should we not go along with that and say something about numbers? The schedule says nothing about numbers. We should like to see a number specified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have deliberately avoided the issue. The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that the schedule replaces schedule 1 of the Transport Act 1978. Part II of that schedule says:
	<br><q><p>"The number of passengers carried must not exceed 7; and if any passengers are carried in the course of a business of carrying passengers, the number carried must not exceed 4".</p></q>
The Labour Government deliberately put that in; the Conservative Government, as a deliberate act of policy, have taken it out. That did not happen without some design.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's highlighting of the issue. The Bill should not contain this blank cheque. When it becomes an Act, someone will have to interpret it. How does one interpret schedule 1? Does it specify a number? Is the car safe to carry five or 25? Let us have what the Government have always stood for, fair competition. That would be achieved by specifying the number five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether we like it or not, the people covered by schedule 1 will be in competition with taxis and hire cars, yet taxis and hire cars are the prerogative of the Home Office rather than the Ministry of Transport. I hope that the Minister can tell us why that is so. It would be interesting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>575</span>
to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that they should not be the prerogative of the Home Office. Then we could have some sense. We could carry legislation under the auspices of one Dept. When we examine the Bill we find that the Home Office is to take charge of parts of its operation. We have to consider not only the activities of the Department of Transport, but what the Home Office is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government believe in fair competition. I also understand that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have met representatives of the Federation of Taxi Owners and Drivers who asked them a large number of questions. One of their fears was that others will be able to move in, with unlimited seating capacity, while the taxi men are restricted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the Minister's problems. The Home Office controls the legislation affecting taxis. Yet we shall be passing a measure which—perhaps unintentionally—will create unfair competition for those who depend on this activity for their livelihood. How can we pass such legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister would give a categorical assurance that the Ministry of Transport will take over responsibility for taxis from the Home Office, so that there will be conformity, that would be a different kettle of fish, but we have to deal with the situation as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Party is supposed to support fair competition, but the Government, by failing to specify a limit on the number of passengers, will force untold numbers of taxi drivers to opt out. They have made the competition completely unfair. The Minister could bring about fair competition by accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow my hon. Friend's argument closely. He contends that there is an obligation on Ministers in the Ministry of Transport to have some regard for fairness in the competition between those who operate taxis under Home Office legislation and those who will operate hire cars under the Bill. Will he reflect on the fact that when we tackled the Minister on this issue we were told that we should take account of modern conditions rather than be prejudiced by licensing conditions that were thought appropriate 30 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>576</span>
The Parliamentary Secretary is now telling us that we should have regard to taxi licensing laws, made in the last century, that for some obscure reason allow taxis to carry up to eight passengers in Wales. He is telling us to disregard the effects of legislation, that I understand his party did not oppose, from 1968 and 1978 which set limits for the hire car vehicles to which he now refers, and allowed them to carry only four passengers in the course of a business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He has raised an important point. If we were discussing legislation that applied only to Wales it would be a different matter, but we are discussing legislation which will apply to the whole country. There may be a wonderful situation in Wales, with elongated taxis. If so, I am pleased that they have them there, but there are other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with the safety of passengers, and with unfair competition. I am amazed at the Minister who is the defender of fair competition. This is what the Bill is all about. But how can he defend a situation where everybody can have the widest choice and do what they like except the taxi driver who is under the control of the Home Office.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I do not understand. I am reading from the notes on clauses, excellent document that it is, despite its blue colour, of which I do not approve. It says that the schedule is a simplified version of the Twelfth Schedule to the 1960 Act. That Act is straightforward, especially as it refers to the number of passengers who may be carried in a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>577</span>
vehicle. It is crystal clear. In part II, paragraph 2 it states:
	<br><q><p>"The number of passengers carried must not exceed four."</p></q>
What has changed? The restriction was perfectly reasonable, and to the best of my knowledge we have had no representations saying that it is unduly severe and causing trouble except for 19 taxis in Wales or somewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"The number of passengers carried must not exceed five." That is a concession, no less than 25 per cent. towards the position of the Parliamentary Secretary. I cannot understand what justifies the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be most grateful if the Minister could explain that in words that I can understand. He usually speaks in words that even I can understand—and that is saying something for a lawyer. Perhaps he could explain why, since the figure four has been satisfactory for at least 20 years and, for all I know, before that in many earlier measures, it is now unsatisfactory. More to the point, what is more satisfactory about the figure five? If four was justified in 1960—it was a Conservative measure and, presumably, rationally thought out at the time—and fits in with the black taxis in London, why is it not now justified? There are a lot of other hackney carriage regulations throughout the country, particularly applying to vehicles that are not purpose-built, providing for a maximum of four passengers. I have even ridden in some in London where the maximum number of passengers is three, because the driver takes up what, in effect, would be a passenger seat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To remove that seems to me to put the licensed taxi trade all over the country, at a disadvantage, except in Wales, where they apparently, carry around half the rugby team, some sheep, or something like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister owes us an explanation as to why the change is now necessary. God knows, most of the taxi drivers are not likely to be Labour supporters, so I am not raising the matter on their behalf, most of them seem to be the epitome of the small business man and so would support the Conservative Party.—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

would be a better description. Some of them will be most disgruntled by the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may begin by following up the last remark of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), I have had the pleasure of meeting a number of deputations of taxi drivers, and those representing them, from London and from provincial centres. I know that they by no means agree with many of the things we have put into the Bill, particularly on car sharing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter they put to me was that they would like to be able to initiate sharing arrangements rather more regularly amongst their passengers. I referred them to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. There are, of course, excellent reasons why, in regard to taxi legislation, that should not be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that occasion, although right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite are correct in dealing with the matter of taxi and hire car operations, the amendment they are moving to limit the ability of the passengers to share the fare would not, I think, be overwhelmingly popular with taxi drivers, who tried to persuade me to the contrary, although I had to explain that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary was responsible, and they appreciate the law which he operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the next point of how we need to legislate in line with legislation by other Departments. As regards the education clauses, there has been close discussion between my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Education, who are both concerned to facilitate the provisional school transport at minimum cost. We discussed that yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the Home Office—from which we are not divorced—the position is that the understanding between ourselves, my right hon. and learned Friend on the one hand and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on the other, is that the Home Office retains the responsibility for taxi legislation. There is, quite rightly, considerable legislation and control in that field. That includes control over the maximum number of passengers in a vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In London the number is four. That, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has, as far as I am aware, no intention of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>579</span>
changing. Many local authorities have taken advantage of powers under the previous Government's legislation to impose limits in their areas—normally four seats or five. Again, we do not wish, to override that legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some areas where no limit has been imposed. I am not aware of taxis constructed to carry eight, but there may be hire cars of that capacity. It appears that there are areas of country where it is legally possible to operate as a taxi or a hire car up to a limit of eight passengers as the Government have drafted it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, of course, the car is not constructed to be safe—and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) is very concerned about the safety of passengers—there are other regulations to cover that possibility. I am referring to the Motor Vehicles Construction and Use Regulations 1978, Regulation 97(1). That makes it clear that a vehicle has to be loaded, either with passengers or other impedimenta, so that at all times
	<br><q><p>"no danger is caused or is likely to be caused to any person in or on the vehicle or trailer or on a road".</p></q>
So a taxi, a hire cab or a private car cannot sail along the road loaded with passengers or baggage to such an extent that it is constituting a danger to the passengers or to anybody else. I can recall occasions when accidents have been caused by vehicles being dangerously overloaded by people larking about, and criminal and other prosecutions have ensued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far I have covered Home Office law, and event the construction and use regulations relating to overloaded vehicles. Here we are considering the taxi law, of which there is a considerable quantity. It may be old legislation, but at the moment it is accepted by all parties. In the provinces, the local authority legislation was passed by the previous Labour Government, but as far as I am aware, it had the support of Conservative Members—and we are not changing it. So there is taxi and hire car legislation and limits on the number of passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill does not override any of that legislation. The purpose of part I of schedule 1 does not seek to override any of that legislation. It simply takes it out of our legislation, thereby reserving it to the legislation of other Departments to govern taxis and hire cars in that one situation in which passengers are travelling at separate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>580</span>
fares because they have decided among themselves to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that I find it difficult to conceive of many situations where six, seven or eight passengers travel in a taxi—I do not know whether such vehicles exist—and then divide the fares. But that is a matter for a local authority to determine. Local authorities should take the powers under the previous Labour Government's legislation and put limits on the number of people in a cab. What we do not want is to have someone operating quite lawfully within the present legislation as a taxi or hire car driver who then finds that a lot of people pile into his cab, up to the legal maximum in his area, and put him outside the law because they agree among themselves to divide the fare. Suddenly, he has a taxiload of people travelling at separate fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill, as it stands, makes clear that that is all right up to the limit. The amendment could mean that in a local authority area—we are talking about fanciful situations; I am told by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) an area the size of Wales—there is no limit at all. So if a taxi driver has a large vehicle and six passengers get in who, in the course of the journey, divide the fare between themselves, he would be operating unlawfully, if the amendment were carried, because he would need a road service licence in that he was carrying passengers at separate fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked earlier whether it matters if the passengers themselves pay money to one of the passengers. I refer to clause 2(7) which says, when it comes to hire or reward, that the payment is relevant
	<br><q><p>"irrespective of the person to whom the payment is made".</p></q>
So the argument cannot be got round by handing money to one of the passengers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When a London taxi is carrying a number of passengers who, under part I of the schedule, are clubbing together to pay the fare, does it cease to be subject to the Home Office taxi rules or does it remain, as a London taxi, fully bound by all the rules and regulations and by the limitation to four passengers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I assume—I do not know whether my hon. Friend will agree—that what lies behind amendment no. 68 is the sense of grievance which London taxi-drivers have—a sense of grievance which I understand and for which I have some sympathy—because they are still limited to carrying only four passengers. If the amendment were carried, the London taxi drivers would not be satisfied. The nature of their grievance would only be emphasized
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>582</span>
even more, because although the number five had been introduced they would still be restricted to four passengers in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A London taxi is restricted to four passengers whether they all pay in the ordinary way or share out the fare among themselves. That is a matter fixed by Home Office regulation, and will remain so. If the passengers share out the fare amongst themselves, the status of the vehicle is not changed. It remains a London taxi. But because of the schedule it is not affected by our legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is quite right. The amendment, if carried would have no effect in London, where there is another control limiting the number of passengers to four. The amendment would have an effect only in those few parts of the country where it is possible to carry more than five passengers in a taxi. There, a taxi driver could suddenly find that his operation had been made illegal by six, seven or eight passengers piling in and sharing out the fare among themselves. I therefore invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister two very serious questions on this matter. We are trying to deal with a serious point connected with the way in which the law treats taxis and hire cars. It is our contention that the Minister may have inadvertently—I do not suggest for a moment that he did it on purpose—made it possible for hire cars to operate in a way which would give them a passenger number limitation completely different from the limitation that applies to taxis. Is the Minister absolutely convinced that all local authorities have used their powers under the ancient taxi legislation to impose an equal limitation on the number of passengers that hire-cars, as well as taxis, may carry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask this question for a very practical reason, because of what I have seen in areas of the country other than London. Perhaps hire-car operators in London are more careful than operators in other parts of the country, or perhaps the law is different. In other parts of the country the matter is regulated by byelaws. If I recall rightly, a very ancient piece of legislation, when the Home Office produced that legislation giving local authorities the right to limit the number of people who could travel in a taxi, it published a model set of byelaws but left it to the local authority to decide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>583</span>
whether or not to adopt that model set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should therefore like to ask the Minister whether he is absolutely satisfied that, whether or not they followed the model byelaws set out in the original Home Office legislation, all local authorities have imposed a limitation on the number of passengers that a hire-car may carry in the course of business which is identical to the limitation imposed on taxis. Have some local authorities—as I think may be the case—applied their byelaws only to taxis and not to hire-cars? If that is the case, I submit that the Minister may inadvertently have opened up a certain difficulty here. Even if that is not the case—and here I come to my second question—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.0 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>10.17 p.m. 	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am ready to give way to the Parliamentary Secretary if he thinks that it will help the Committee for him to answer my question, which is serious and relevant to our proceedings. Will he tell us, first, whether all local authorities, in using their powers from the Home Office, have in every case prescribed a figure both for hire cars and taxis, and not just taxis? Secondly, have they always prescribed an equal number for both?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is relevant to the possibility of our reaching an understanding between the two sides of the Committee on the amendment. Our major concern arises from the possibility that hire cars will inadvertently be given an advantage over taxis by the way in which clause 2(2) and the first three paragraphs of schedule 1 are drafted. I have put the second question so that the Parliamentary Secretary will not think that there is a trick in the first one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Parliamentary Secretary answers my questions in the affirmative, I shall wish to know whether things have just happened to work out that way or whether the Home Office strictly requires local authorities, when prescribing for taxis, simultaneously to prescribe the same numbers for hire cars. If that is not so, I can see another way in which we may overcome the difficulty arising from our possibly suspicious way of reading this part of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Parliamentary Secretary will answer my questions. If he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>584</span>
does so, I shall make a suggestion that may enable us to withdraw the amendment and proceed with the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion will be. He has asked me two questions which fall well outside the scope of the legislation and which are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. I shall answer them to the best of my ability and knowledge, given that I am not being advised by officials from that Department, although I am sure that my advisers know the law on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of the legal requirements is that there is no obligation for local authorities who take up those powers to put the same limits on hire cars and taxi cabs. However, I believe that in practice almost all of them have, and the Home Office takes a favourable view of putting the same limits on the two types of vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the position, but I cannot see that either of the right hon. Gentleman's questions has the slightest bearing on the legislation before us, which—particularly part I of the schedule—is aimed to make sure that we do not make law that conflicts with or overrides other provisions covering this sphere, or the powers and responsibilities of local authorities under legislation of the previous Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a different position from that which I understand was taken by Government and Opposition on the two previous occasions when the matter was debated by Parliament. In the legislation of 1960 and 1978 it was thought proper to place a limitation in respect of the number of passengers who could be carried in the course of a business by cars that were operating other than as public service vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effective legislation now, which is the 1978 Act, and the 1960 Act which prevailed before that, interfered—to use the Parliamentary Secretary's phraseology—in what a hire car business could do. I suggest that if we remove the limitation without an absolute assurance that the Home Office will deal with the problem that we have raised, it would be far better to do what the present law does, and prescribe the limits in Ministry of Transport legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that there is no argument about that. If there is, we can check the legislation. The 1960 Act prescribed the maximum number of passenger seats in a car used for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>585</span>
business purposes if it is not a public service vehicle, and so did the 1978 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment interferes no more than those Acts did. In fact, it is arguable that it is less interfering, as it opens the scope for four to five passengers to be carried in the course of a business. On that basis, I believe that the amendment is valid and I am not inclined to offer what may be another possible solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said in his reply that taxi drivers are telling Home Office Ministers that they would favour a change in the arrangements and a lifting of the restriction—presumably that means in the Home Office legislation as well as this Bill—so as to enable those drivers to initiate the sharing arrangements. If that is so, it raises an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not attempt at this stage to suggest that we deal with the matter of discrimination between hire cars and taxis. I had not realised that that was raised by this legislation, and I have not examined the matter. Speaking off the cuff, however, I cannot see that that alters the amendment's validity in any way. I would assume if the Home Office brought forward legislation which allowed drivers to initiate, they would deal with the question on the basis of the Parliamentary Secretary's advice in respect of both hire cars and taxis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Home Secretary does not propose to change. He has not responded favourably or given any assurances to these operators that he is considering changes. He has listened without giving assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the car construction issue is very important. I am not suggesting that it is not important that a car constructed for four passengers carries eight or nine. It is not crucial to the amendment and, if it happens, presumably our amendment is a safeguard in that it makes the whole thing illegal. In practice, if we are right in our amendment this is a loophole and some local authorities have not, because the Home Office law has left them free to decide, put limitations on hire cars where they have put them on taxis or have imposed different limits. I would say that the construction of all sorts of vehicles and vessels has always followed legislation. No matter how daft the legislation may have been, some constructor has constructed in accordance with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one time legislation was passed in this country which said that if a ship did
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>586</span>
not exceed a certain deck area it would not have to pay above a certain level of harbour dues. Somebody constructed a ship called a turret vessel, the deck width of which was about one-third of the width of the vessel. It sold rapidly to a number of ship owners until the law was changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same may well apply here. If there is a loophole in the law as we suspect—not necessarily as a result of the Parliamentary Secretary being remiss, I can understand him wanting to leave legislation to the Home Office—as a result of the Home Office being remiss and not having safeguarded or insisted that every local authority in its byelaws dealt with absolute parity between the hire car and taxi, we should safeguard the position here by passing the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be one other way in which to do it if we could be assured of the way the Home Office legislation works, but that has not been forthcoming. I believe that our amendment has proved to be valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Road Traffic Act 1960, which restricts to four the number of passengers to be carried, appeared 16 years before the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 which gave local authorities the power to restrict the number of passengers in taxi cabs and hire cars. That no doubt explains why back in 1960 it was thought appropriate to have such a low limit. Now all we have to do is to set a limit which makes it clear that our legislation does not overlap with the local authority legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the loophole of the kind that the right hon. Gentleman described exists, and I believe that all the fears that he expressed for overloaded vehicles and unfair competition should be dealt with by the local authorities, which is exactly what the 1976 Act provides for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this stage may I suggest that I withdraw the amendment so that we can study before Report Stage the legislation to which the Parliamentary Secretary has referred? That will enable us to get on more rapidly. If that had been said in the first place we might have proceeded more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

No. 69, in page 50, line 6, at end inseit—
	<br><q><p>"8A. In the case of a journey to a particular destination the passengers must not include any person who frequently, or as a matter of routine, travels, at or about the time of day at which the journey is made, to or to the vicinity of that destination from a place from or through which the journey is made."</p></q>
We now come to the issue of public service vehicles in the area of contract carriage operation. This is an issue of which the Minister has had long notice. I raised it on Second Reading when I asserted that the contract carriage definition in the Bill was different from that contained in current legislation and would make possible a whole series of operations that cannot currently take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was challenged by the Minister who denied that that was so. I hope that I shall have an apology for that, because we have both had time to study the matter more deeply and it has been established beyond a shadow of doubt that the views of all those whom I have consulted and those who have studied the issue carefully confirm the view that I put on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of restrictions on contract carriage operation are removed by the Bill, but the one to which the amendment refers is by far the most important and is of most concern to hon. Members. It is, the restriction in our present law preventing a contract carriage operator running a regular service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present a public service vehicle may be run as a contract carriage. A road service licence is not required and provided it is run on a single fare basis that contract carriage may pick up people in one place and put them down in another. They can be picked up in a town and put down in a factory. They may be picked up at a factory and put down at a place of entertainment. The requirement that the arrangement has to be made by somebody other than the operator is not being changed. That person goes to the operator says that he has made an arrangement with a group of people whereby he receives payment from them and he asks the operator for a contractual arrangement to produce that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many services are provided on that basis, but there have been a number of limitations. In fact, all 12 paragraphs of the schedule to the 1960 Act give an idea of those limitations. However, a number are now being swept away, which accounts, in large part, for there being only eight
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>588</span>
effective paragraphs in schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides that a journey to a particular destination must not include a passenger:
	<br><q><p>"who frequently, or as a matter of routine, travels at or about the time of day at which the journey is made, to, or to the vicinity of, that destination from a place from or through which the journey is made."</p></q>
We have picked up the exact wording of the existing legislation, though we shall not make a great point of the wording as long as the essential meaning is accepted. It might be better phrased, but the Parliamentary Secretary understands there is now nothing in our law to prevent people running regular services on a contract carriage basis within conurbations. I have looked at all parts of the country. One could quote examples from London. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) and I described the provision on Tyneside and we were told that there were a number of examples there where it applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opinion of those who have examined the matter is that this way of defining contract carriage operation, which is so different, will enable people to avoid the need to have a road service licence though they will be able to provide a public service. They will be able to advertise—within the limits on advertising which I admit are restrictive, but not as restrictive as in previous legislation—that they will pick up people in one town at half a dozen stops and put them down in another town at half a dozen stops. Provided they advertise within the prescribed limts—the Parliamentary Secretary does not seem to disagree that this can be a contract carriage operation—they can pick people up in one town and put them down in another town. Other provisos are that they charge only a single fare and that the contract to provide the service is made by somebody other than the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may have been a mistake or misunderstanding on the part of the Minister. I shall try to save time and put it to the Minister that it cannot really be his intention to amend schedule 12 of the 1960 Act to allow a practice that would patently cut clean through the proposed new basis of licensing, let alone existing provisions on licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can save much of the Committee's time if the Minister will agree that he has now so changed the definition of "contract carriage" that it could cover all sorts of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>589</span>
operations, because I do not wish to belabour the Committee with examples. The new definition will enable services to be run town to town, place to place, picking up in the vicinity of one place, setting down in the vicinity of another, provided the contracts were set up by someone who had arrangements to collect fares and were within the advertising limits. That is a highly undesirable extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Contract carriage" has a place in our transport system. There is no doubt about that. It has been operated without much difficulty or complaint from operators or the public. I suggest that the amendment is needed to keep the definition within reasonable expectations of what can be done by "contract carriage" rather than by those who require road service licences. I hope that this will not prove to be a contentious matter and that the Minister will either accept the amendment, which would be easier, or undertake to table his own amendments for the same purpose on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the right hon. Gentleman again but I cannot undertake to accept his amendment or anything similar. I can best illustrate why by pointing out how completely unenforceable the amendment would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends belaboured the problems that they thought arose from enforcement of some of the provisions in clause 2 and other places. I cannot see how one could enforce a provision which said that a contract carriage:
	<br><q><p>"must not include any person who frequently, or as a matter of routine, travels, at or about the time of day at which the journey is made, to, or to the vicinity of that destination from a place from or through which the journey is made".</p></q>
I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will agree, on reflection, that the amendment would require a quizzing of the passengers to determine whether they included any person who frequently, or as a matter of routine, travelled on the journey. I can think of nothing less enforceable and nothing against which the operator would have less protection. The danger that there might be among the passengers in his contract carriage someone who had smuggled himself aboard without admitting that he frequently made the journey is something from which no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>590</span>
one could protect an operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not confine myself to the unenforceability of the provision, because, I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that he has identified the major issue between us on "contract carriage". We discussed on Second Reading some of the changes that we were making to "contract carriage". The right hon. Gentleman regarded one change as being of substance, and I suppose that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the amendment or an improved version of it, "contract carriage" allows for regular contract carriage arrangements. That is, it will be possible for someone other than the operator to hire a vehicle that would take people at single fares on a regular journey, daily or weekly, to work, school or some frequent event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the right hon. Gentleman reached the point where he pointed out with a faint hint of horror in his voice that we were opening up the way to regular contract carriage I heard my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham say "Good", which is a sentiment with which I wholly concur, because it is not an accidental difference between the two sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to facilitate the regular arrangement of contract carriage services where groups of people want to fill a gap in their transport requirements. I illustrate that with the example of two groups that we hope will take advantage of the ability to organise regular contract carriages—commuter clubs and parents' associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see nothing wrong with a body of people, who move from the same area of residence to the same place of work, organising daily or as regularly as they like by way of a commuters' club a contract arrangement with a bus company to provide travel for them. We see nothing wrong with parents' associations in villages from which all the children go to school in a nearby town or village arranging a contract to take their children daily to and from school at the appointed hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, in the village of Ruddington in my constituency I have already warned the parents, who are extremely agitated at the lack of public transport to take their children to school and at the unfair and heavy burden of fares laid on them at present, that the moment that the Bill becomes law they will be able to organise themselves into a parents' association and settle down with a parents' association bus at contract carriage rates to go back and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>591</span>
forth with all their children to the schools that they attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to encourage such schemes and can see nothing wrong with them. Contract carriage will be taken out of the road service licence requirements, and we cannot see anything objectionable in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that the difference is one that is entirely predictable. The Opposition have taken a narrow defensive line, heavily influenced by the more nervous—and only the more nervous—among the commercial operators and those who work for them. We have taken a much more liberal and optimistic line and we have particularly taken the point of view of the passenger. We believe that there are many passengers, commuters and parents, who will benefit and we look forward to an extension of contract carriage arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if my hon. Friend could help on a factual point. Am I right to assume that a service that is being provided over 30 miles, say a regular commuters' club 30 miles from the centre of London, would not even be a contract carriage, but would come within the express service category and equally would not require a road service licence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly confirm that. As long as no passenger can travel a journey of less than 30 miles, no road service licence of any sort will be required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the most incredible reply that I have ever heard. To begin with, I cannot understand what possible relevance there can be in saying that contract carriage is taken out of road service licence provisions. As I understand current legislation, contract carriage has never been within the road service licence provisions. That is no part of the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has successfully identified the change. Regular arrangements were not contract carriages before. We are making sure that regular arrangements are contract carriages and therefore outside road service licensing. If I misphrased what I said earlier and did not make that distinction clear, I accept the correction. That, in fact, is the change that we are making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful and clarifies
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>592</span>
matters. We are agreed upon what we are talking about, which is that something that at present requires a road service licence, if this part of the legislation is passed, will not in future. Depending on the size of the vehicle, and so on, it will require a PSV, but it would be able to run as a contract carriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, the matter of distance raised in an intervention by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) is equally irrelevant to the argument, because the contract carriage definition has no mileage limit whatever. One can contract to go 100, 200 or 300 miles under the arrangement. That is not part of the argument between us, which is very clear and explicit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument concerns whether one can set up a contract carriage arrangement to provide a regular bus service from A to B with a public service vehicle that is subject to no road service licensing requirements, depending on exception limitations concerning advertising of the service, and also subject to someone setting it up who is not the actual operator—in other words, provided the operator receives a contract from somebody else to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that if the Parliamentary Secretary reflects on what he said about unenforceability, he will admit that he was not quite up to par. He knows as well as I do—in fact, possibly better than I do—that a Conservative Government put into legislation the amendment that we are now debating, believing that it was a proper way in which to define contract carriage operation. They did that in the 1960 Road Traffic Act. Part IV of Schedule 12 states:
	<br><q><p>"In the case of a journey to a particular destination the passengers must not include any person who frequently, or as a matter of routine, travels, at or about the time of day at which the journey is made, to or to the vicinity of that destination."</p></q>
In other words, legislation introduced by a Conservative Government in 1960 in precisely similar circumstances was unenforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to start an argument in which the Minister of Transport will defend the Labour legislation of 1978, and say that I am a wild Left-winger who is trying to move the policy of the Labour Party way out of line, while I defend the 1960 legislation of a Conservative Government. That would be most undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this is a serious aspect of legislation, and we accept that there are difficulties in enforcement. If every one of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>593</span>
the proposals in the Bill had to pass a test of strict enforceability, the Minister would not get far, and he knows that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Up to now the system has worked. For about two decades there has been limitation. It has worked reasonably well and it has not stopped people from setting up contract carriage services in many areas. I am not sure that in certain instances it has had the effect that the Parliamentary Secretary supposes. If he examines the matter carefully, he may find that some people have found ways of running regular services. I do not think that that is desirable, but I believe that it has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point is that what is being done in the legislation is not to allow people to fill gaps, but to get in and set up highly favourable arrangements to take over certain parts of existing operations that require road service licences. That is really what it is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that there is another underlying purpose that the Parliamentary Secretary may have as a reserve reason. He knows that what is being done by the Government in certain other areas, including the Education (No. 2) Bill, will leave a large number of operators desperately looking for somewhere to use their buses. He will be able to tell them that he has changed the whole of contract carriage law, so they can go and make an arrangement with somebody who can contract for them to get into an area. If they reply that they cannot do that without a road service licence, he will tell them that they can, because he has taken out the restriction which required them to have a road service licence in order to operate regularly on a particular route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a disgraceful provision. I am horrified to hear that the Minister was serious about it. I can only advise my hon. Friends to oppose it now and to try to find a way between now and Report of organising much greater support for the basis of the amendment now before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I briefly express my wholehearted support, not only for the Bill in its present form, but for the very robust speech of my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary. I am delighted that he has made the intention of this legislation absolutely and categorically clear. The intention is to meet a need that is clearly felt by a large section of the travelling public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>594</span>
If ever there was a clear distinction between the philosophies of the two parties, it is expressed in the Opposition amendment. It is the most extraordinary amendment one could ever see. We have the statement that operators are allowed to provide bus services so long as they do not satisfy the particular needs that passengers feel. In other words, they must not allow a passenger to go to a particular destination to which he wants to go. He must not be allowed to travel from the place from which he possibly is able to travel, on the day on which he wishes to travel, or at a time he regularly wishes to travel. In other words, if a passenger wishes regularly to undertake a certain journey, the bus operator must in no way be allowed to provide that service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a most extraordinary concept. It shows that the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) realises that there are people who actually want to use such bus services. If he did not, he would not have put down the amendment. There are indeed such people. I am very conscious of how many people in the South of England, particularly those who commute into London, find themselves in a desperate situation in terms of both inadequate and very expensive travel arrangements. The clause offers some alternative facility for those people to travel to and from their place of work.

That is just one facility. But there are others. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary referred to parent-teacher associations. I would add hospital visiting.

establish regular commuter journeys as express services would be successfully opposed by British Rail on every occasion. That can be done anyway under the express service arrangements. But there are many commuter areas within 30 miles of central London and other cities where in future people will be able to take advantage of this new facility. Certainly, it means competition for British Rail. I believe that that will ultimately be for the good of both British Rail and its passengers. At present, too, many of our customers are captive travellers, because they have no choice. This will offer some choice.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment paves the way for an amendment which, while narrow in purpose, has an importance in trying to bring to the Bill a clarity of intention. It is also a means of ensuring that what is intended to be a genuine provision of exception in the way in which clubs can advertise contract carriage arrangements that they have made operates in a particular way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It provides that a club will have such a right or facility, or be exempted from the limitation on advertising that applies to certain other organisations, provided that it has been genuinely set up for another purpose—that is, a tennis, or football club, and so on. The amendment also provides

at present expressed. I am delighted that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary defended it so robustly, and I am frankly surprised that the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness took so long to realise what it was all about, particularly when so often over the past months we have referred to the need to provide commuter coach facilities. That has always been evident. I am delighted that, if any doubt existed before, none exists any longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>that there will not be a loophole through which people will be able to set up clubs ostensibly for some other purpose, but really to get round the law limiting the advertising of contract carriages. It is as simple and straightforward as that, and I believe experience has shown that, given such a loophole in the law, people will use it.</p>
	<p>I do not suggest that someone will start a club called the Schedule 1 Travel Club, or anything quite so blatant as that. But I think that unless the limitation is written into the Bill there will be a number of fiddles. Organisations will advertise widely something that is supposed to be a contract carriage arrangement, and which has other advertising limitations, and get away with it by saying that they are acting under the auspices of a club.</p>
	<p>I do not believe that the Government intend that that should happen, and I hope that they will happily round off their approach to schedule 1 by accepting an amendment that is intended to improve the Bill and to conform with their purpose.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the amendment is moved in a genuine spirit. As the right hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We debated adequately in the last amendment the difference of opinion between us. My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham and I have made clear that clubs should be able to take advantage of the contract carriage arrangements. It is our intention that if anyone forms a Faversham to London commuters club, or a Ruddington to West Bridgford school bus club, he should be allowed to operate such a service by way of contract carriage. The Bill facilitates that. We made clear during the debate on the previous amendment that there was unfortunately a wide difference of opinion between us. I know that he has taken the amendment from a similar provision in the Transport Act 1978. A provision of that Act specifically excluded commuters' clubs, but we wish to encourage commuters' clubs and I therefore invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), may I remind the Committee that, following a request from both sides of the Committee, I agreed that certain general
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>598</span>
attached to them are not present for the debate. In my opinion it is a serious indication of how frivolously some amendments are being proposed when hon. Members in whose names the amendments have been tabled have not even bothered to turn up for the discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What arrant nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has to have the accolade for absolute frankness. He is making clear that the Government are giving an open invitation to the people of this country, though not to do what he said. He attached a far wider significance to the amendment—which only imposes limits on advertising—than it possesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the amendment affects the setting up of clubs. It merely ensures that one cannot set up a club specifically to gain advertising advantage over other organisations. I greatly regret what the Government are doing here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully accept the statement of the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) that we are talking about working people. I have never denied that. But working people will suffer if there is a total undermining of genuine road service licence services. For that reason, we shall do the only thing that we can, and record our fundamental difference with the Government on this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 4, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>points concerning clause 3 and the schedule that have not been raised so far, could be raised now.</p>
	<p>However, I also remind the Committee that we did, in effect, have a stand part debate on part I of the schedule, and it would not be in order for those arguments to be deployed again.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As always, Mr. Dean, I fully
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>599</span>
accept your guidance and I do not want to deploy any of the arguments used previously on schedule 1, or on the related clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of the debate we have covered all the ways in which, under the provisions of schedule 1, the Government are opening up the scope for services under the heading of contract carriage, which are not permitted under existing legislation. We have, I believe, sounded the feeling of the Government on two aspects—one an important and significant aspect, and the other a comparatively narrow aspect. But the tone and the temper of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply was such that I do not think that there is much point in pressing further at this stage. When the full enormity of what the Government have said, particularly on the first amendment, is realised by those concerned with transport in this country there may be such a reaction that a different situation will exist when we reach the Report stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one reference to our proceedings by saying that it ill behoves the hon. Member for Meriden, who stopped the proceedings of the Committee at a time when he would have made up the quorum, to refer to some of my hon. Friends being absent, as they rarely are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Member explain whether he considers it the same for an hon. Member to be absent, but next door and available to be called back, and absent when his name is attached to an amendment that is being debated? It would be strange if he does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I attach importance to hon. Members putting their names to amendments, and if the hon. Gentleman attaches the same importance to that perhaps he will put his name to some of the Government amendments in future and we shall apply the same test to him. I do not want to pursue that now. We shall see if the hon. Gentleman is prepared to follow through the logic of his own words when we see the Amendment Paper next Tuesday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must now consider in a different light the attitude of the Government to the serious problems that they are creating for passenger transport in this country, and return to our debate next Tuesday possibly in a different frame of mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>600</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been stung into making one or two remarks. It is clear that there are distinct differences in approach, both on policy and philosophy, towards transport between the two sides of the Committee. That has become clear in debates on the schedule, and on clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are certainly not convinced by the argument that in setting free competitive forces the taxi operators, or the small business men as we know them, will be helped. Certainly they have fears, with good reason, that they will be disadvantaged by the Bill and the unleashing of this new potential against the organised taxi trade. They will soon realise the full extent of the legislation and the considerable effect it will have on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members have talked about the poor people who may get advantage from the Bill but we do not need to be told or educated about people in that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) that he talks to some of the commissioners involved in the allocation of licences and find out about the problem of the rundown of rural services. The problem, under any system, is that one cannot make a quick buck on a rural service and those areas are therefore disadvantaged in not having services. It is the needy people who will be disadvantaged, because there will not be people running in to provide a service in areas where money cannot be made. Indeed, the existing rural services will be undermined by many of the Bill's provisions. Further evidence of that is given in the county council reports on some of the surveys conducted on rural areas. Do not take my word for it. Take the work done by the Association of County Councils, which is clearly not inclined to my political view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my right hon. Friend was right to say to the hon. Member for Meriden, when castigating some of my colleagues who at this stage have decided that certain agreements can be understood between both sides—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not say "Ah". As I understand it, the pressures were coming long and strong at different stages. That is inevitable. It is happening in every Committee Room in this corridor. In those circumstances, there is a possibility for hon. Members on both sides of the Committee to fit into their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>601</span>
own personal arrangements to leave early. Both sides of the Committee are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distinction made by the hon. Member for Meriden in dealing with this amendment on the sharing of taxis and private hire cars is because, some hon. Members having put their names to an amendment, he felt it was in bad grace that they had left the Committee. He was making rather much of that, but I should have been more impressed if, during the presentation of the amendments at earlier stages in the Bill, the hon. Member had not had the radio in his ear listening to that and not the arguments made by Labour Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) is extremely strange in his arguments. First, he presumes that it was a radio, secondly, that I was listening, and, thirdly, that I do not have the intelligence—perhaps he does not—to be able to listen to anything that he said. Perhaps I was just searching for the big booth sound, which might well have been a musical phenomenon not often known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found the hon. Gentleman's statements hypocritical in view of the fact that when we returned to one sitting, when some of us were about 35 seconds late, he made an extremely sharp remark about it. I feel fully entitled to make any comment I like about those people whose names are on the amendments being debated. I can quite understand hon. Members having to make arrangements not to be present. I can understand perhaps one hon. Member not being here, but four out of six, when important amendments to clauses are being debated—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I understand that there are deep differences on the schedule. We cannot debate them again. I have not previously responded to any of the remarks made every now and again by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness about Report. Although this is not a matter for me, about the schedule we had a slight disagreement on Second Reading concerning what changes we were or were not making in contract services. We have made a change in allowing for regularity, and I have given every due deference to the tremendous amount of heat the right hon. Gentleman is able to generate about very small change. We have debated this. Otherwise the schedule reproduces the previous legislation in almost every respect, and I cannot, for the life of me, see how we can possibly return to this rather stale matter on Report. No doubt that is not too far away and we shall find what we have to report on on Report. Meanwhile, I commend the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
