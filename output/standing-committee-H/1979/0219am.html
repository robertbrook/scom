	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 211 in page 65, line 16, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"4A. The obligations of the Corporation transferred by virtue of section 36 include any obligation of the Corporation, National Carriers Limited or any subsidiary of National Carriers Limited to afford travel concessions to employees transferred to the Corporation, to National Carriers Limited or to any subsidiary of National Carriers Limited from the employment of the British Railways Board under the Transport Act 1968 or to widows or dependants of such employees and the Minister of Transport shall, out of money provided by Parliament, reimburse the successor company in respect of amounts paid by the company to that Board and the London Transport Executive in connection with those concessions."</p></blockquote>
I propose to be brief, but hope to have an opportunity to speak again should my brevity be ineffective. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I accept that paragraph 7 of the schedule seeks to make similar provision to the amendment. However, we are advised that the amendment better secures the objective which appears to be common to both sides of the Committee—namely, to guarantee the carry-over of travel concessions, which former British Rail staff carried over into the National Freight Corporation in 1969 in respect of existing staff and the widows and dependants of existing and former staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of considerable importance to those employees and their widows and dependants, and I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say about the amendment before proceeding further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) for that brief introduction to his amendment. I know that it deals with a subject which is important to the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1650</span>
Gentleman and to the employees of the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has raised the matter with me outside the House because of his anxiety about the travel concession arrangements for employees of the National Freight Corporation who were employees of National Carriers Limited when National Carriers was transferred from British Rail to the NFC in 1969. Those former employees of National Carriers, together with their widows and dependants, have, since that time, continued to enjoy the usual travel concessions on British Rail and London Transport services which are available to all railway staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position is that there are substantial numbers of employees and their widows and dependants enjoying such benefits. Under the Transport Act 1978 the previous Government undertook to reimburse the corporation for the payments that the corporation was making to British Rail and to London Transport for these travel concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of the employees is entirely clear. The new company will succeed to all the rights and obligations, particularly all the contractual rights and obligations, of the corporation. Contracts of employment will, therefore, remain intact. The present terms and conditions of employment will remain intact, and there is no question of the company, in the unlikely event of it wishing to do so, seeking to avoid its obligations where those terms and conditions include travel concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's powers under the Transport Act 1978 to make payments to compensate the corporation for travel concessions will continue. The aim of the amendment is achieved by para 7(1) of the schedule which expressly provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The obligations of the Corporation transferred by virtue of section 36 include any obligation to comply with terms attached to a payment made under section 21 of the Transport Act 1978."</p></blockquote>
That specifically refers to the travel concessions and it therefore underlines the fact that the successor company will remain liable for the same obligations as the former corporation. The Government's position will not be changed either. We have stood behind the concessions since 1978 and it is our intention and that of the corporation to continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the concern of the com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1651</span>
pany's present employees and those who represent them about the position of the widows and dependants who have acquired the rights. There is no need for that concern. All the corporation's legal obligations to maintain the concessions will be transferred to the successor company and the Government will stand behind it and reimburse it for the cost of those concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the amendment be withdrawn. It is not technically perfect, but I do not retreat behind technical points. It is unnecessary because the Bill adequately covers the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend appreciates that there may be concern on the other side of the coin among those working in other organisations who do not receive free travel concessions. Are the travel concessions taxable, particularly, as the Revenue taxes those who must commute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) that there is concern about this sort of concession and, to those working outside the transport industry, it is probably surprising to discover that a wide range of employees are entitled to free travel. I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept that when we are transferring the corporation to a new company, it is not the right time to go through the considerable upheaval of trying to get out of these involvements. They are long-standing obligations which are bound to fall upon the successor company. We shall, therefore, continue with the present arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I reassure my right hon. Friend that travel concessions are taxable since they are regarded as part of the employees' emoluments. That is a welcome contrast with concessionary coal which, for reasons that have always escaped me, remains an untaxed perk available to a wide range of National Coal Board employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has confirmed that schedule 6 makes clear that certain obligations and liabilities now attaching to the NFC will be attached to the successor company. Perhaps the Minister will appreciate that a similar consideration applies to a number
	<span class='label label-info column'>1652</span>
of other obligations and liabilities that are to be transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand the Government's position, which they would defend on the ground that they want to secure the best possible price on the sale of the assets for the public interest. They want to remove from the successor company a number of the obligations and liabilities which now attach to the National Freight Corporation. A simple and direct example of that is the provision in the Bill for removing certain pensions payments obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic seems to be not that the initial obligation is the sole point at issue, but whether there is a continuing obligation. Given that the Minister says that he wants to see the NFC kept together as a single efficient entity in the freight transport industry, and is promoting a Bill which says nothing of the sort, the Committee will understand that we cannot leave the matter there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can appreciate why the Government might defend the position of not having continuing limitations on the successor company. They may feel, first, that that gives them the opportunity of selling at a higher price and at an appropriate time, and second—in accordance with their political philosophy—of allowing those who will be running the successor company to take decisions on a purely commercial basis. But the Opposition have considerable fears about what will happen to a number of those obligations should the successor company decide to sell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing in the Bill says the successor company shall not at some time in the future sell part of what is now National Freight Corporation, or one of its subsidiaries—which may be a better way of putting it—to another company. Can the Parliamentary Secretary therefore make clear whether the obligation in paragraph 4 of the schedule is only in respect of the successor company holdings while they remain as such and that any transfer of a subsidiary, with its employees' rights, does not necessarily come within the same limitation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying, "Have no fear about these obligations and duties to employees while the part of the operation about which you are concerned is in the hands of the successor company. But beyond that there are no such guarantees. In other words, any guarantees of transfer of contract of employment rights
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1653</span>
beyond that will either lie in other legislation or be non-existent"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, is he saying—and if so we should like to know where it appears in the Bill—that some obligations in respect of employees, such as concessionary fares, would be continued beyond the successor company if it should choose to sell any subsidiary or part of NFC? The issue is fundamental to the amendment and to a number of others that we are considering. However, as this is the first amendment to deal with it, we should be glad if the point were made clear at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be drawn into any vituperative exchange with the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) concerning his mean-minded intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Parliamentary Secretary will know from our debates, I am no expert in the minutiae of drafting. I understand from parliamentary agents—I hope that it is permissible to mention them in Committee—that their doubts over the present drafting are whether what might be described as subsidiaries and possible subsequent subsidiaries are covered by paragraph 7 of the schedule, and whether widows and dependants are covered in all foreseeable circumstances.
I have one other point. I seek confirmation from the Parliamentary Secretary that the obligations on those organisations would continue whatever happened to the obligation of the Minister to make the contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to any intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), and to the agreement of my right hon. Friend, I think that we are prepared to withdraw the amendment provided that the Parliamentary Secretary gives an undertaking that if, after reconsidering the matter, our advisers still retain their doubts, we might talk to his officials. Then we could clear up any misunderstandings and ensure that the Bill does what the Parliamentary Secretary clearly intends that it should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is room for doubt on the subject. Clause 36(3) states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"all the property, rights, liabilities and obligations of the Corporation"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1654</span>
are to be transferred to the new company. That includes the full extent of its present obligations. Clearly it is not our intention that anything in the Bill should enlarge those obligations. But I understand that the obligations at present extend to the subsidiary companies as well, and to the provision of travel concessions for employees and widows and dependants of former employees of the old National Carriers and in respect of those who were formerly British Rail employees. But for the Ministerial power to reimburse there would probably be no need for further specific reference in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that to mention specific rights and obligations that are transferred would cast doubt on the generality of the transfer under clause 36. I hope that I have made that clear. If the intention is a wholesale transfer of rights and obligations one can create doubt by singling out odd instances. The fact that others are not mentioned may cast doubt on whether it was Parliament's intention to transfer them. It is our intention that the full extent of the present corporation's rights and obligations towards third parties and towards its own employees should be transferred to the new company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a specific reference in paragraph 7 because of section 21 of the Transport Act 1978. That empowers the Minister to reimburse the corporation for the cost of the provision. In practice that it is what has been done. If we had not put a specific reference in paragraph 7 there might have been doubt whether Ministers were empowered to reimburse the successor company. It is our desire that Ministers should be so empowered and that reimbursement should continue. That is the reason for paragraph 7. There is no need for a specific reference to the corporation's obligations. Paragraph 7 is there to make clear that the Minister's powers in relation to the obligations are carried forward under the Bill to the new company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) asked what would happen if there were a disposal of part of the business. But whatever happened could equally well happen now. We are neither diminishing nor enlarging the 1978 provisions. There is nothing in the 1978 Act to prevent the corporation disposing of subsidiaries or other parts of its business. If it did so before, or if the successor company does so now, there is a great deal of other legislation on con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1655</span>
tracts of employment, and rights and obligations towards employees will be continued. Paragraph 7 is designed to make clear that the Minister would still be empowered to reimburse the corporation for the travel concessions so long as the successor company continued to make them, regardless of the circumstances in which it did so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to envisage—although, as far as I am aware, it is no one's intention—that the Corporation would shed to a third company a subsidiary which employs many people and gives travel concessions of that kind. It could be part of the arrangement that because a third company could inherit the terms and conditions of employment, the successor company would continue to pay for travel concessions for its former employees. As long as the successor company did that, our Bill would ensure that the Government continued to be empowered to reimburse the company for those concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can think of many hypothetical situations that might arise, but the intention of the Bill is to keep the status quo, and that is the best way for the Committee to look at it. The Bill as worded achieves our intention not to enlarge on the obligations nor diminish the rights of employees and their widows and dependants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always prepared to consider the argument that further wording might be necessary to underline the intention three times, if that is what hon. Members would like. But one does not wish to add to the wording of a measure simply to clarify something which, one is assured, is well covered by the Bill as drafted. But I will consider any further arguments made and my Department will look at any drafting suggestions made at official level. I assure the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness that any legal argument or suggestions that there might be deficiencies will be examined with care by the Department's legal advisers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not seek to delay the Committee. I might not have looked closely enough at the Bill. Can the Parliamentary Secretary give the Committee his views on the point that the wording of the Bill tries neither to detract from nor add to the concessions, and that the Companies Act company will continue to shoulder the obligation of concessionary travel?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has made clear that this would apply
	<span class='label label-info column'>1656</span>
even to a third-party company, so we can leave that point for the present. In view of his assurances that the Government will reimburse NFC and that the obligation regarding travel concessions will continue with the new company, can he say whether it also applies to the existing capital grants to the company that were agreed under the new capital structure agreed in 1968? If that is so, will the capital grant as such continue from 1981? Will there be any further obligation on the Government to give money to the new company? Perhaps I am confused about what is a capital grant and what is a concessionary grant, the simple point being that, as the obligation to pay capital grant finishes in 1981, presumably that is not so in regard to grants for concessionary fares.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 296 deals with capital grants. Our intention is to preserve exactly the position that applied in 1978. Reimbursement for concessionary travel is, therefore, open-ended as regards time. Payment of capital grant is subject to an end date in 1981. On both of these, the principle is the same as regards the Bill and the Government's policy. Our intention is "no change", so the powers of the Minister in both respects will be exactly as they were under the 1978 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. May I seek your guidance? New clause 23 is not yet indicated as having been selected. Is that because it falls later in the Bill? The reason I ask now is that it may have a bearing on the issue we are now discussing on amendment No. 211, and I wondered whether I should pursue the matter fully now or merely deal only with the narrow point of the amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that the powers remain the same as under the Act in respect of subsidiaries. New clause 23 deals with the Minister's specific power in respect of dissolution of a subsidiary. I wish to raise the question of what would happen to the pensions of those who were in a subsidiary that was dissolved under the Minister's existing power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the debate seems to be nearing its close, I think that it would be more convenient to leave that point for the time being. I will consider what the right hon. Gentleman has said and when best
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0900">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1657</span>
the points arising under the starred new clause might be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary's undertaking will considerably relieve the concern expressed by 7,000 or so staff and 8,000 or so widows and dependants of former staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 296, in page 65, leave out lines 30 to 40.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall follow the example of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) and be as brief as I can. To some extent, this is a probing amendment. The Minister is given the duty or the right to continue making capital grants for capital expenditure. The Government have already written off £100 million of public expenditure in order to make shares more attractive for the private sector. Whilst it would be right to carry on grants for capital expenditure, we are very concerned that none of that money should be channelled in any way towards making shares in any company or subsidiary more attractive to private buyers. Certainly, if there is outstanding capital expenditure, it would be right for the Minister to go ahead with that grant, although I understand that a considerable amount of the £15 million has already been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to obtain an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary, because there is nothing in the Bill to this effect, that none of that money will be used to make the shares even more attractive to private buyers. Having already written off £100 million of public money, it would be grossly wrong if any of that money was channelled in that way. That is the concern behind the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I think that I can reassure the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans). As he has said, the part of the schedule to which he has drawn attention, as clearly he does not actually wish to delete it, concerns the power of the Minister to pay grant for capital expenditure in National Carriers Limited. Of the £15 million provided for under the previous legislation, £12 million has already been paid, so there is only £3 million outstanding. Until the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1658</span>
appointed day, when the corporation becomes a Companies Act company, that will be payable in the usual way. All that is reserved by paragraph (6) of the schedule is the power of the Minister, if the appointed day comes before the end date in 1981, to continue to pay grants to the successor company on the same basis as to the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman is really interested in whether the nature of the grants will be changed in any way. The answer is "No". Whether they are to the present corporation or to the successor company, the grants would be linked to capital investment specifically in the business of National Carriers Limited. There is no statutory right at present to make payments for any other purpose, to make the business more attractive in any other way, and the nature of the present statutory powers would not be changed in any way by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I assume that no member of the Committee wishes to take away the Minister's power to make grants for capital investment, the power would remain exactly unchanged. This covers the situation in case the appointed day comes before the statutory end date of the 1978 powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful as far as it goes, but it does not give an indication of the Government's thinking in respect of payment of grant beyond the point where the successor company is wholly publicly owned. Presumably, if the power to pay grant continues beyond the appointed day, unless there is something within the Bill to indicate to the contrary that power can continue beyond the point where some or all of the shares have been sold. What is the justification for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does not the Bill contain some limitation against continuing the grant beyond the point when all shares are sold? It was made clear in the debate on clause 36 that the Bill provides an option to the Minister of declaring the appointed day immediately prior to flotation or to declare an appointed day and to have a considerable period prior to floating shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee must pursue whether there is justification for making the grant at a point where nothing can be added to the value of the public asset. There could be an in-between phase, admittedly, when part of the shares had been sold,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1659</span>
with the successor company partly privately owned and partly publicly owned, when I suppose there would be a balance of consideration whether the public interest would best be served by making a grant in respect of what was partly a privately owned and partly a publicly owned asset, but I cannot see that that sort of consideration can apply beyond the point where all shares are sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Am I right in thinking that there is nothing in the Bill now to limit the right and, therefore, if the wording is left unchanged the power of the Minister to make the grant could be continued beyond the point where the successor company was within any form of public ownership and answerable to the Minister in respect of its dividend policy or any other part of its policy other than the strict obligations that it must inherit under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The power to make grants will continue subject to the present limitations, and that does not include, because it was not anticipated, the possibility of the company becoming a wholly privately owned company. We are talking about the tail end of 1978 powers, and the present limitations are wholly adequate for everybody's purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the maximum amount of grant payable under the 1978 Act was £15 million and, as I said, £12 million has already been paid. The capital investment in National Carriers continues this year and there is not likely to be much change out of the moneys available after the end of 1980.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other limitation on the 1978 powers is that, in any event, they expire on 31 December 1981 and there is no grant payable in respect of any capital expenditure incurred after that date. We are contemplating a possible sale in 1981, although leaving ourselves completely open, as I said in previous debates, to judge the right moment for sale. Therefore, there is only a faint chance that there will be even a Companies Act company floated before this has become a wholly academic point and all the grant paying powers have expired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If by any chance we should have the successor Companies Act company set up and a public flotation before December 1981, and if there was some small amount of grant paying power still available, obviously the Government would consider
	<span class='label label-info column'>1660</span>
carefully whether they were to make grant available in those circumstances. The nearer it gets to becoming a private sector company, the more it is inappropriate to give it grants that are not available to competitor companies in the same industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not believe that those circumstances are likely to arise, and it is not necessary to cover them explicitly in the Bill. Certainly, it is not the Government's intention to take for themselves in any legislation a general power to start using taxpayers' money to reimburse companies for investment in their businesses which should be financed out of the market. I do not think that the Bill does that, and it is an odd concern to come from the right hon. Gentleman. It would be more likely to come from behind me. There is no danger in the Bill. It is likely to be academic, and any further payments of grant are more likely to be made during the life of the NFC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Bill stands, the grants will not be paid after 1981 either by the mark I company or the Companies Act company. It will still receive Government money in its investment grants. One of the NFC's previous complaints was that money given to it in the form of investment grants was subject to Treasury control and was cut back as part of the reduction in public expenditure. Is it envisaged that the remaining grants for 1981 will be subjected to further cuts, as they would have been under the NFC and as would be the case in any nationalised industry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) asked about taxation losses and the financial arrangement that nationalised industries often attempt to claim for themselves when they are non-profit making. The Parliamentary Secretary undertook to indicate the position on tax losses in the NFC and any private company wishing to buy it. Will he indicate that now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the second point, I am not prepared to make a statement, but we are still looking into it. I do not claim accounting expertise myself, but those who advise my Department and the Treasury are discussing any tax loss position of the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned grants and Treasury control. There is no statutory duty on the Government at present to make the grants. The relevant section of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1661</span>
the Transport Act 1978 empowered the Minister to make them. As I said earlier, we are neither enlarging nor reducing that power. So far, the grants have not been subject to cuts. Substantial payments have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital investment will be made this year that will qualify for grant, and at the moment it is the Government's intention to reimburse. One can never say "never" in politics, and at present the grants are not subject to axing under public expenditure constraints, but one of the Government's principal aims is to keep reviewing their public expenditure programme. The grants could have been cut out at any stage under the previous legislation, so nothing has changed, but they are likely to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Parliamentary Secretary's helpful and reassuring reply, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have considered the point raised by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). I think that the matters in new clause 23 could refer to the whole of schedule 6, and it would be convenient for him to raise the matter in the final debate on the schedule as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: T beg to move amendment No. 295, in page 66, line 27, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"	<i>Promotion of research and development</i>"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>9. The obligations of the Corporation transferred by virtue of section 36 include any obligation under subsection (2) of section 46 of the Transport Act 1968 to promote research into matters affecting the functions of the Corporation or any subsidiary and the doing of such work as is requisite to enable the results of such research to be turned to account."</p></blockquote>
To show that we are still in opposition, as it has been so peaceful this morning, I point out that Christmas is over and this is not a probing amendment. Section 46 of the 1968 Act imposed upon the NFC—I use the word "imposed" advisedly, because that is what we seek to do—an obligation to carry out research in the industry. The NFC has done that successfully. It has been a pace-setter in the industry, and nothing but good has come from that. Indeed, the rest of the industry has benefited from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1662</span>
The NFC has carried out various projects, such as the project on energy saving which was extremely useful and unique to the industry. Had it not been for the NFC, that would never have been done. The NFC has investigated vehicle design and, again, the spin-off has been useful to the whole industry. The NFC has considered the potential for heavy lorries and that, too, is an area of research from which industry can benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to maintain that obligation on the new company. The Minister may argue that it still exists, but we are not sure that it does, and the best way to make sure is to incorporate the obligation in the Bill. We feel that, as much as anyone can benefit from the Bill, the industry as a whole will gain because there will be a large body carrying out research. The Government themselves have used the NFC for forms of research. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary will not oppose the amendment but will immediately agree to accept such a good idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably as well for the political reputations of the hon. Gentleman and myself that we find something to be controversial about soon. I think that we have found it in this amendment, although it would be wrong to underrate the value of any organisation carrying out research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained in previous debates, clause 36 carries forward the rights and obligations of the present corporation to its successor Companies Act company. But that does not mean that all the statutory duties at present laid upon the NFC will be carried forward to the successor company. Among the present statutory duties under which the NFC labours there is a duty under section 46(2) of the 1968 Act which obliges the NFC to promote research and development work into matters relevant to its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's view is that it would be inappropriate for the new private sector company to be under a specific statutory obligation to engage in research and development work. That is not the way in which any other private company operates, and it is not a statutory duty imposed on the competitors of the NFC. The NFC under this Government, as under previous Governments, is operating on a commercial remit in competition with companies which are not burdened with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1663</span>
these statutory obligations. If one has the long-term interests of the corporation and the company in mind, it is plainly best to put it on a level footing with its competitor companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That need not mean that there is any question of the successor company suddenly abandoning valuable research and development work. But, like any other commercial company, it will have to decide what research and development work is appropriate to its needs and what can be financed by it in the light of its trading performance. Therefore, it will finance its research and development in the same way as any other company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present statutory obligation which the amendment seeks to continue is an example of the sort of burden under which nationalised industries are sometimes placed. The NFC is a nationalised industry which is not a statutory monopoly, so it is in direct competition with other operators, even in its own mode of transport, and has its hands tied behind its back 	<i>vis-à-vis</i>its competitors. If one has the interests of the business and its employees at heart, the company should operate on level terms. That means that the research and development work should be aimed at its own market and commercial needs, and as the largest company in road haulage it can be expected to maintain a substantial research and development effort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the Committee to reject this, the first of several amendments of its kind, which will load on to the back of the private sector company that we intend to launch various statutory obligations which will limit its ability to compete with complete freedom in the market place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It comes as a relief sometimes to be able to argue. I think that that was the Parliamentary Secretary's worst contribution to the proceedings on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From skipping through the annual reports of the NFC it becomes clear that the corporation has done a great deal of extremely useful research. It has not been indulging in far-blue-yonder stuff, with people engaged in a great deal of theoretical physics or anything of that sort. It has been sound practical work, designed to secure some sort of noticeable improvement in the performance and safety of vehicles, in the protection of the public, in the carrying capacity of vehicles and in the improve-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1664</span>
ment in the performance and safety of vehicles, in the protection of the public, in the carrying capacity of vehicles and in the improvement of engine and lorry design, which should show some return to the organisation and to the rest of the road transport industry within a reasonable period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One finds reports on improvements in vehicle design, work on electric battery vehicles, on improving safety and the protection of the public and staff. There is the matter of transporting bulk chemicals and other dangerous substances, much work on saving energy, on cutting down on noise and dirt—which everyone accepts are produced by large lorries—on the management of waste at the other end of the transport process, on evaluating speed governors for vehicles, which clearly is a valuable subject, and on air deflectors to cut down drag and improve a vehicle's energy use. From the staff viewpoint, there is work on reducing internal cab noise. Of course, any improvement in the safety and performance of vehicles is to the benefit of those working in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all against the background that the rest of the industry is totally fragmented and does virtually no worthwhile research at all. The British road transport industry spends the lowest proportion of expenditure on research in Western Europe, even allowing for the existence of the National Freight Corporation. At present, 85 per cent. of the country's haulage companies have five vehicles or fewer. It is no good our looking to them for research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the benefits of public ownership for this industry has been that it has put its back into such practical research, which has a spin-off to those 85 per cent, of hauliers with five vehicles or fewer. In the design of special vehicles it has collaborated with vehicle manufacturers and with those who produce goods that are difficult to transport. This transport organisation makes a valuable contribution in such ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a bizarre time suddenly to decide that such research is not necessary. If the Parliamentary Secretary regards all that as a burden—that is what he called it, and in a sense it is—the new company will not take it on. It will quickly shrug it off, because not all the return on investment from the research will accrue to the company. A great deal will benefit the rest of the industry.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0904">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1665</span>
There is not much sign that the rest of the industry will get together to do its research on a co-operative basis. That would be alien to its whole ethos, which is based on cut-throat competition and has all sorts of near-beer organisations floating around.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is increasing worry about environmental pollution from the roads, damage to roads, safety of operators and of others using the roads, and a significant increase—which is right—about waste of energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Conservative Members do not support the amendment they will be deciding to wipe out the only significant piece of research being carried out by the road transport industry. That is the inevitable consequence of not accepting the amendment. Those who consider that it is time to do away with this useful and energy-saving research, must be off their heads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Garry Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that the National Freight Corporation is not the only body carrying out such research. The Transport and Road Research Laboratory has also been doing extremely good work which is highly regarded internationally. I can see no reason—nor do I understand why the hon. Gentleman does not agree with me—why a private sector company should be required to carry out work of this kind, which is of benefit to the whole industry but which can best be done by a body which has at heart the interests of the whole industry rather than of one company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are those who doubt whether the amount and quality of work of the road research people are satisfactory. Certainly they are unsatisfactory because they do not make anything like the impact on road safety, energy saving or vehicle design that they should. That is partly because operators can ignore them. One of the virtues of the work done by the NFC is that it is such practical stuff that only a fool would ignore it. But there are plenty of fools in the road transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the points that we have been making throughout our discussions on the Bill, including on Second Reading, is that those who say that the private sector can do the job just as well as NFC are not telling the truth. Without spending an abundance of money, the NFC has conducted first-rate practical research for the improvement of the performance
	<span class='label label-info column'>1666</span>
of the industry generally. That is not a task which the new private sector company will undertake because it will be regarded as a burden that should be abandoned. That illustrates that, even allowing for the doctrinal differences between us, some Conservative hon. Members might be capable of recognising that there are advantages in retaining approximately 10 per cent. of the road transport industry within the public sector because of functions of this kind which it can discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that the Minister is not present. There must be a Tuesday Cabinet meeting. He has always talked of the competitive nature of NFC. It has always managed to compete while at the same time discharging its obligation to carry out research. It will be a sad day if Conservative Members reject this reasonable amendment which will ensure that further practical work on lorry research will be carried out in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One aspect to which my hon. Friend has not turned his mind is that, assuming that Utopia is not around the corner, as Conservative Members seem to think, and none of the shares is sold, we should still be taking away the duty to carry out research. That would be ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept, as usual, what my hon. Friend says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have come to what is a considerable difference between us. This is reflected not only in the attitude of my right hon. and hon. Friends to the corporation with most of its ideas embodied in the 1968 Act, but it is especially epitomised in the argument about integration. We shall come later to the question of integration and the abolition of the Freight Integration Council. I shall not stray out of order on the question of integration or rise to the argument that because of the transfer of Freight-liner to British Railways it is somehow no longer possible for integration to be a function of the NFC. We shall come to that argument later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with an obligation imposed on a corporation which we consider has a responsibility to society to pursue an objective greater than that which is solely determined by commercial criteria and there is a similar argument about integration. We feel that NFC has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1667</span>
an obligation to the community in setting up this organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the points made about the amendment was whether sufficient research is being carried out, whether the obligation placed on the NFC has produced benefits to the road industry in both the private and the State sectors, and, being unable to discriminate between the two sectors on the benefit of that research, whether the clause is justified given the time that the NFC has been in existence. The Government are faced with the question whether, if that research is justified, that obligation should be imposed on the private sector. They have said that they do not believe that that is a proper statutory obligation to place on the new Companies Act company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record of the NFC shows that it has done valuable work which has been of assistance to Britain. The results of some of its work have been used in Europe. The NFC has a reputation far and wide for its work. One should look not only at what the NFC says about that, but at the report of the Select Committee which investigated the NFC in 1972–73. That was some seven years ago, but even then considerable advances were being made in research and I believe that it was fair for my hon. Friends to mention one or two of those projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A valuable point has been made about the amount of money spent on research. Whatever the reason, it is lamentable that in this country far too little money goes into research. Governments of both parties have pointed to that in criticism, whether compared to Europe or to any other advanced country in the world. Nearly all industries in Britain spend less money on research than in Europe or the other major advanced technological countries. That was true not only of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, but at the beginning of the century. There is certainly something wrong with our attitude towards research. It probably has as much to do with our industrial decline as all the attention given to industrial relations by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall leave aside arguments on our comparative position on research and deal directly with the amount of research done by the NFC. One can argue about what constitutes research but one can show that some achievements of the NFC have certainly been of benefit to the industry.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1668</span>
Again, these are revealed by such matters as the first steps taken by the NFC towards setting up HGV training which the private sector for a number of reasons—money being one—was not able to provide. The NFC became the HGV training centre for most of the lorry industry. Later, when the training finance system was changed the industry began some of its own training. However, the initiative was taken by the NFC and it is a matter of record, in the report of the Select Committee, how advanced it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is also true of what happened environmentally. The NFC tried to encourage the industry to take the big lorries off the streets to service shops in the afternoons. That also showed initiative. Some initiatives met with success while others were not as successful as expected. Those initiatives in integration and research are to the credit of the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One aspect of this, which is much in the mind of the industry, required a great deal of capital. About 8 per cent, of the companies operate five lorries or more. Many of the benefits are those of scale. Even though the corporation has only 10 per cent. of the market, the national network is a great advantage in this kind of work. The corporation has used that advantage. It has not exploited it because it cannot be readily exploited. Ten per cent. is nowhere near the dominance that is required to obtain such an advantage. Nevertheless, the corporation has used the advantage of scale and size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) spoke of other national organisations and referred to the Road Research and Traffic Laboratory. Certainly, we need more organisations doing such research. I understand that that will be a Government funded organisation. An interesting comparison can be made with other national lorry companies, which are not undertaking such research. The only example that the hon. Gentleman gave was one that is funded by Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note from the Select Committee report that the National Freight Corporation made no claim on Government for money for any of its research. The corporation was asked by the Select Committee whether it had asked the Government for money and it replied that it had not. It is also interesting to note that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1669</span>
the Select Committee actually recommended that Government should consider giving money to the NFC to carry out research. So far, the corporation has done this out of its own resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of its latest projects is of great benefit to the industry. If that project is broken up, it is doubtful whether the present network could be maintained under private ownership. I admit, however, that it is a matter of judgment what will happen to the corporation when it becomes a private company. I refer particularly to the corporation's work involving computers. I have said nothing about energy saving, which has been of advantage to the corporation. Its research work is available to other companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the computer project. It costs a lot of money to instal a computer. Clearly, a small company cannot afford to do that. Nor, apparently, can the larger companies carrying out lorry operations in Britain, perhaps not on the scale of NFC, but maintaining a network. The computer has been used to deal with a major problem in the transport industry—that of all the empty lorries on the road and the constant problem of return loads. That is a problem in terms both of energy requirements and of transportation costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFC has developed a system whereby, using the computer, advantage can be taken of the benefits of a network system. That allows operators to identify return loads for a small charge. The system helps to improve the productivity and efficiency of the industry and effects a saving in energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That system is to the credit of the NFC. It is a rapidly developing aspect of its work and arises directly out of the corporation's research and development programme. Clearly, it costs a lot of money. If the corporation were operating solely on commercial criteria, it might be arguable whether that project should be developed. A balanced judgment will have to be made on whether it will be a paying project in 10 years time. The charges will be for use of the computer in such a development might produce a return only in 10 or 15 years. Certainly, it will be a considerable period. That may be sufficient for a private company to decide not to conduct such investment and research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is another example of a positive contribution by the corporation which may have been influenced by the duty imposed upon it by Section 46 of the 1968
	<span class='label label-info column'>1670</span>
Act "to promote research and development." The corporation was given that obligation under the 1968 Act. There are many examples of developments in its research which came about because of the size of the corporation. The Minister says that the corporation hopes to keep the same type of unit. But of course he cannot guarantee that that will happen. No one can guarantee that. Commercial criteria will determine the future of the company. There can be no guarantee that the company will continue to carry out research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister does not even go that far. He made a rather mealy-mouthed speech. He simply plans to take away the responsibility and says that if the company does not make a profit research will not be done. Unfortunately that is the traditional attitude of most of the industries in this country. I wish that the Government used their arguments and energies to deal with low productivity to ensure that Britain produces what it should produce. I wish that as much energy were spent on the problem of research as is spent on the problems of industrial relations. No doubt we shall hear more about those today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the differences between the parties, we can at least agree to look at what a Select Committee of the House said about the maintenance of the research function of the National Freight Corporation. In the section of its report dealing with environmental research and experiments the Select Committee said that the National Freight Corporation was well placed to take the lead in co-ordinating research and mounting pilot schemes which would be carried out on an increasing scale in an effort to solve environmental problems. The report speaks of the research work done by the NFC on the design of lorries, on the delivery of goods in urban centres and on the co-operation between Government, freight transport associations representing the private sector and other bodies. It is particularly interesting to read the following:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Your Committee welcome the fact that the N.F.C. is closely involved in this kind of work. They note that no requests for help towards meeting the cost of experimental schemes have been made by the Corporation to the Government. In your Committee's view, progress in these important matters might be easier if the Government were armed with greater powers to encourage and, if necessary, to finance in whole or in part work carried out by outside agencies, including the N.F.C. Your Committee recommend that legislation necessary for this purpose should be introduced."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0907">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1671</span>
The Government are certainly introducing legislation. But they are doing the exact opposite of implementing the unanimous recommendation of the Select Committee that legislation should be introduced to increase the possibility of further research being done. All that is before us today—although our amendment is designed to change that—is to remove an obligation from the NFC which reduces the prospect of research acilities in the industry. That is contrary to what we require, and contrary to the recommendations of a Select Committee consisting of hon. Members from both sides of the House. That Committee was impressed by the successful record of the NFC and recommended that the Government should legislate to strengthen the process. The Bill weakens the whole position. It removes the obligation. We shall therefore press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is regrettable that the Government should take such a narrow doctrinaire attitude to the amendment. They appear to be saying that above all else the successor company must regard itself as existing solely to pursue its own narrow commercial interests when considering research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is noticeable that my hon. Friends have argued the value of retaining that role beyond the point where there is any direct financial holding for the public in the industry. It has fallen to this side of the Committee to argue that, even when we have no further interest in the company on the ground of public ownership, its research and development role will be valuable. That is a clear and distinct difference between Government and Opposition. In this industry, with its high proportion of small units, only limted research on the scale required can be carried out. The NFC, or its successor is not the only body to carry out research, but this research will not be covered unless someone in transport with operating experience sees it as part of his duty and role to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall define the sorts of research that I think are possible and desirable, to show the area at present covered peculiarly by the NFC and which we should like to be covered by its successor. First, there is pure research, which can be done in a Government research centre which has no
	<span class='label label-info column'>1672</span>
commercial obligations or direct experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I am aware, the NFC is conducting no pure research at the moment. The statutory duty about which the Opposition are getting so worked up has not encouraged any of the activities being described. Nor is there any reason why it should. I do not seek to criticise the corporation, but the right hon. Gentleman seems to believe that a large amount of academic pure research is being carried out by the NFC, when nothing of the kind is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to show that there are three types of research that can and should be done in this area, and I was identifying which of the three I thought at this stage peculiarly appropriate to the NFC or its successor. I said that, first, there is the pure research that can be conducted out with the industry in a Government research station. I do not say that that is appropriate to the NFC or its successor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further area of research going on outside NFC that is considering the requirements of major own-account forms of transport. That is being carried on to some extent by bodies other than the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third area of research—this is the one that is so much dependent at present on the NFC or a successor as to be in danger if at least the spirit of the amendment is not accepted—is into the hire and reward freight operation, in other words, the exploration of the way in which industries and other services can be served by expertise in transport services. This is the area in which the NFC has special experience that is extremely valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) is excellent. The organisation, while covering only 10 per cent. of the market, is probably still the biggest operator, and it can therefore explore the extent to which, given modern computer capability and the development of the right software, one large operator can offer a service to many small areas. If someone would pay for the hardware and software of a computer system that could carry within its records availability of empty waggons and match them for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0908">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1673</span>
return loads, that service would be available to the whole hire and reward section of the transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister need not get hung up on the question whether it would be a liability and whether it would necessarily militate against the commercial interests of the successor company. I think that we can meet him on that point. There is no reason why that sort of research should not be sold by the successor company to other companies which want to take advantage of it. The important point to establish is that this kind of research and development should go on, that someone should be doing it, and that the benefits accruing from it should accrue not only to the company doing it but to the industry as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 46(2) of the Transport Act 1968 states neatly what is required. It says that the work being done should be done in a way that will
	<br><blockquote><p>"'enable the results of any research and anything resulting from any idea … to be turned to account."</p></blockquote>
That is neat phraseology for an item of legislation in an area where we have been critical of drafting. That is what we want. We want to see research and development take place and be turned to account in the freight industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon Gentleman says that he is happy for the results of this research to be turned to account. Many companies in the private sector undertake research which they not only use themselves but sell to other companies.
They do that for the good reason that they find it profitable. Surely, the profit motive is a good reason for a company such as the successor to the National Freight Corporation to carry out such work if it is worthwhile. The best test of whether it will be worthwhile is whether it will be economically viable, which will turn on whether in the long run a profit can be made from it by all such companies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's intervention because it touches on two highly relevant points in the argument. One is whether research will take place anyway because it is commercially attractive and can be sold. The other is whether, given that that might be the case, there is need for any kind of obligation to be written into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1674</span>
I take the latter point first. It is regrettable that in recent years—this is not a party-political point; it has been true under successive Governments—considerable areas of British industry and services have not performed particularly well in research. Other countries with which we compete in many areas of commerce and industry have had better performances in research and development. I shall not touch now on the extent to which that has been due to Government backing or otherwise, but it is unquestionably true that a number of British industries have fallen behind on developing good research ideas to stay in the forefront.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this area, as my hon. Friends have said, transport concerns in other European countries have devoted more time to research and development. Whether one does it if one is running the successor to NFC does not alone depend on whether one thinks that it will pay off and be saleable. That is only one consideration. The other is how quickly it will pay off and how many years will elapse before there is something saleable. In other words, can one afford, particularly at a time when one is trying to sell off shares, to take a decision to do something which will pay off in a few years' time? One has not only to convince oneself that it will pay off in a few years and therefore improve the earning capacity of the company, but that must also be shown to people who are likely to buy the shares once one is in the commercial world. That is much more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFC might have half a dozen ideas which it would like to research and develop and which it thinks will be good for patents that it will hold and be able to sell five, 10 or 20 years hence and make good a return on. But it will not necessarily be free in the widest sense of the word to take that decision now because it will have to take a view of how it will perform over the next few years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree also that much of the practical type of research carried out by the NFC—for example, minor adjustments in vehicle design, operating techniques and so on—does not lend itself to patenting because these are not particularly novel steps but are merely changes in practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. In that area the Minister's argument about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0909">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1675</span>
whether it is commercially attractive is more persuasive. I am arguing about the commercial viability of certain lines of research in areas where there may be possibilities of holding patents or hardware by which services could be sold. I am not in any way trying to belittle the type of research mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson). That is extremely important and has a valuable spin-off effect, and I share his fear that that type of research may be lost as well. But I am now trying to concentrate on another area, that is, the type of research that I consider to be at risk as the result of an early commercial decision by the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister very fairly acknowledged, the successor company will be in the position of following upon a record of improving performance over the last few years. We need not argue about the exact period, but there is no disagreement in the Committee that NFC's performance in its earliest years did not bring the kind of great return that would make it look an attractive proposition for anyone buying in. It is only over the last few years that the performance has improved, owing to reorganisation and expert management. Presumably, the Minister is looking forward to further improvements in performance so that when he comes to sell off this public asset he will get a good return on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly touch on the types of research with which I am concerned. I mean the type of research that would be best done by a large company operating in several departments of hire and reward freight transport. First, there is the question of vehicles themselves. There is now clear evidence that it would be well worth while someone in freight transport looking at the possibilities of liquefied gas vehicles. We need to examine the possibility of laying down specifications for an engine designed from the outset to run on gas as opposed to oil fuels. The only work done in this field so far has been on converting petrol engines, which by their nature will not be as efficient as diesel engines. The difference will be somewhere between 40 per cent. maximum thermal efficiency and 25 per cent. thermal efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great scope for research into the use of the gas vehicle for heavier freight. I do not think that that will be done by anyone else engaged in the hire and reward
	<span class='label label-info column'>1676</span>
business. It is just conceivable that it might be done by a very large own-account operator with an eye to a specialised vehicle for his particular form of freight, but I do not think that it will be done by any private company in the business of hire and reward freight haulage. If the Minister knows of an operator who is considering the prospect, I shall be delighted to learn about it and be proved wrong. It is a crucial area of research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prospects for the use of electric vehicles still require considerable research. Here, there may well be need for a link between pure research and the practical R and D of vehicle operation. The question of training and operating methods has already been touched upon. I only underline what has been said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a period when I had other responsibilities, I had the most bitter complaints from this industry about the way training was organised and about the fact that those who did train were providing for others who did not. There is a case for looking at the economics of training here. However, much of that depends on a scale of operation that is not available save in the NFC and its successor. If it is abandoned by them, it is virtually abandoned altogether. Therefore, the amendment touches on crucial matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subject of safety is unquestionably of increasing importance. We ignore at our peril research into how a whole range of highly dangerous materials can safely be transported on an own-account basis. Examples are the transport of radioactive waste and of some of the new chemicals coming in. The extent to which we can cover this in the House by statutory instrument and safety regulations for carriage is limited. Somebody actually operating the vehicles which carry the dangerous substances must be able to make a major contribution to the practical question of how to move them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of fuel economy scarcely needs to be mentioned. There must be scope for further savings of fuel, which again can be properly researched only by somebody operating on the appropriate scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will think again. If his one major objection is the commercial one, he should not on that ground rule out scope or even a duty to carry out research on the basis of selling the results on a commercial basis. The Opposition are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0910">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1677</span>
worried by the Parliamentary Secretary's initial response, and we believe that before the Bill leaves us we must attempt to persuade him to change his view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important function is at present being carried out by the NFC. That function is important not only to its own future commercial success but to the efficient and economic operation of freight transport by road in this country. That important function is in danger of being lost unless the Minister is prepared to respond in some positive way to the basic idea in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should not have started the debate by encouraging the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) to return to a little controversy. The Opposition have now succeeded in getting carried by their own rhetoric into a far wider area of dispute than is necessary on the amendment before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I need not emphasise that nobody on the Government side underrates the need for research and development in road transport. The Government finance a great deal of such pure research at the TRRL, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) pointed out. Nobody is downrating the importance of looking at energy saving in the whole transport area, or the difficulties of research into the future use of heavy lorries. Indeed, we set up an enquiry under Sir Arthur Armitage to look at the position of the heavy lorry in society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument here is whether a statutory duty loaded upon a particular trading organisation is likely to make a helpful contribution in this matter. The question only arises because it happens that the present corporation has a duty under section 46 of the 1968 Act. This may horrify the Opposition, but T am not sure that that statutory duty has actually made any difference to anybody so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation carries out research and development, as does any large trading organisation. It has not published much. Why should it? So far as I am aware, all that it has published was one leaflet on energy saving, which dealt with matters such as the possibility of wind deflectors on lorries and so on. That is valuable, but it is scarcely in the forefront of research work in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation does not do any pure research work. Nor should it. The research
	<span class='label label-info column'>1678</span>
work that it does is aimed at the commercial remit that it has been given by successive Governments. It is aimed at saving energy by reducing the fuel consumption of its fleet. The computer service has tried to deal with the problem of empty back-loads and so on in order to provide a commercial service to other companies. I have myself heard from the NFC about what it is doing to develop the use of computer services to put together a network of loads and lorries. But that is a commercial service that the corporation proposes to offer as part of its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As of now, such research and development work as the corporation undertakes is rightly aimed at the furthering of the corporation's business position. I seriously doubt that the corporation is financing any research work because it feels impelled to do so by section 46 of the 1968 Act. We are told that the results of its research work should be widely available to other companies in the field, but I do not believe that the corporation has the slightest intention of publishing a great deal of research work to be used by its competitors. That is not part of its job or of its present remit and duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are about to transform a statutory corporation into a Companies Act Company. We expect that a Companies Act company with a 10 per cent. market share, which it may seek to expand in some areas, will obviously engage in research and development. It will be specific, practical research and development of a kind which a trading organisation should engage in, aimed at minimising its fuel costs and maximising its market opportunities. There are very many private sector companies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking about industry generally. The Opposition's belief that the N FC, because of its 1968 statutory duty, is engaged in research and development work which it would not otherwise do as a trading company is total and utter mythology. There is no such research work, and neither should there be. Just like any other private sector company, the new company will be engaged in such research and development work as seems to it appropriate to maximise its market position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair argument if it could be shown that the private sector had done the same work as the NFC. Then it would be fair to argue that because there was a commercial remit the private sector did that kind of work. We have tried to show the sort of work done by the NFC, for which the Select Committee congratulated it. But I presume that the Minister must have asked himself whether the commercial criteria would produce the same kind of relevant work, because it is profit-motivated. I challenge the Minister to give us one example of any other large transport concern—we are talking about transport, not other industries—that has done the same kind of work. Was the Bill drafted on the basis of what happens in other industries, or merely on an ideological basis, with Ministers fearing that it might be difficult to sell the corporation if it had this obligation?

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 303, in page 66, line 27, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The obligation of the Corporation transferred by virtue of section 36 include the obligation of</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1680</span>
	<p>research and development work is done by private companies. In common with Opposition hon. Members, I have no idea what research and development work is done by the NFC, because they do not publish it.</p>
	<p>If, as the Opposition believe, the NFC is the only road haulage company which is considering energy saving, cutting down fuel costs for its fleet and investigating its markets it must have a vast commercial advantage over all its competitors. All the Opposition have described, with an air of wonder and discovery, is the ordinary investigatory work done by a commercial organisation into its costs and its markets. There is nothing more. The NFC is not a source of great research work for the rest of the industry, any more than the rest of the industry contributes anything to the NFC.</p>
	<p>The Opposition have picked up a totally redundant statutory obligation which was written into the 1968 Act and somehow believe that, although it has had no influence whatever on the activities of the corporation so far, it will have an influence if placed on a future Companies Act company. Research and development in a trading organisation is a trading decision by that company. That is the present position and should remain so for the future. It will be hopeless to write in statutory provisions which will have no practical effect on the company.</p>

	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>the Corporation set out in section 137 of the Transport Act 1968 so far as is reasonably practicable to consult with any relevant trade union with a view to the conclusion of such agreements as appear to the parties to be desirable with respect to the establishment and maintenance of machinery for the purposes specified in subsection (2).</p></blockquote></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0912">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1681</span>
	<p>The purposes referred to in subsection (1) are:—
	<ol>
	<li>the settlement by negotiation of terms and conditions of employment of persons employed,</li>
	<li>the resolution of trade disputes within the meaning of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974,</li>
	<li>the promotion and encouragement of measures affecting efficiency, in any respect, in the carrying on of the activities by the Corporation and any subsidiary company, and</li>
	<li>the discussion of other matters of mutual interest to the parties to the agreements."</li></ol></p>
	<p>The amendment seeks to carry forward the present obligation placed on the National Freight Corporation to recognise the existing trade unions and to establish proper machinery and a structure for negotiation and consultation with them. It is intended to carry that over from the obligations on the NFC and other transport sectors covered by the 1968 Transport Act. In passing, I should add that it is a tradition of what might be described as railway Bills that structures and arrangements made for the benefit of the board, management and staff are carried forward from one organisation to another through successive statutory changes, be they in public or private ownership.</p>
	<p>I shall seek to demonstrate, in an effort to convert some Government Members to our point of view, the advantages to the existing National Freight Corporation management of the present arrangements for negotiation and consultation. We see them as of advantage to the new company's management rather than as disadvantages, which is obviously how some Conservative Members see them.</p>
	<p>Labour relations in the NFC have been uniquely good in the road transport industry. I can do no better than quote what the management of the NFC has said about its labour relations over the years. I shall take the chronology in reverse order. The annual report of the National Freight Corporation for 1978 stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As already recorded, 1978 was a difficult year for industrial relations, and the majority of staff showed great restraint in the face of unavoidable delays in obtaining satisfactory pay settlements."</p></blockquote>
On reflection, I think that that is probably the least worthwhile quotation that I shall give.</p>
	<p>For 1977, the report said of the result for that year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This result reflected, in almost every sector of the business, resolute management control, keen marketing and pricing in the wake of higher
	<span class='label label-info column'>1682</span>
service standards, together with freedom from industrial relations troubles."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>For 1976, it observed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This result derived from the action of many people making good and courageous decisions and managing with determination and commitment. It sprang equally from sound relationships with staff and a comparative freedom from industrial troubles which enabled managers to concentrate on efficient operation, customer service and tenacious marketing. The NFC's domestic labour relations have been good since its foundation in 1969 … 1976 was virtually trouble-free. Our own enployees at all levels gave us invaluable and consistent support."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>For 1975 the report pointed out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the difficult operating conditions of 1975 our managers and staff have had an exceptionally heavy load to carry. At all levels our people have shown keen awareness of the problems which have faced us and have responded with patience, responsibility and resourcefulness. We believe no freight business, public or private, compares in quality and dedication. The Corporation thanks all its staff for their continuing effort and loyalty. We have also benefited from the co-operation and support of our Trade Unions under very difficult circumstances."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>In 1974 the NFC chose to include in its annual report a contribution from Lord Greene, then of the NUR, and Harry Urwin of the Transport and General Workers' Union describing the role of the unions within the industry. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'we believe that the relationship between management and the trade unions within the NFC and its companies is based upon mutual respect and a desire to do that which is right and best for the companies and their employees. In spite of all the difficulties, and they have been many, 1974 has had many successes in fostering good relationships and understanding at all levels. They are the unspectacular things that never reach the headlines in the press but which are vital features of relationships within industry."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>I am sure that you will be relieved, Mr. Dean, to know that 1973 is the last year to which I managed to paddle back in the Library. The 1973 annual report of the NFC said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Effective industrial relations are the result of continuous effort and eternal vigilance to keep relationships in good repair. Complacency can bring disaster."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The report quoted the report of the Select Committee of that year which said
	<br><blockquote><p>"there can be no doubt that the general record of the Corporation in this field is excellent."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>That was a reference to industrial relations.</p>
	<p>I commend to the Minister and his hon. Friends what the management of the NFC said about its industrial relations and what
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1683</span>
was said by outsiders. The industrial relations that have prevailed in the NFC have been excellent, compared with the general decline in industrial relations in the rest of road transport industry and in industry generally, particularly since the unlamented Industrial Relations Act 1972. They have been particularly good at a time when there has been a substantial reduction in the staff of the NFC. Substantial improvements in productivity have also been made. Those two factors in industry generally have led to industrial relations problems. It is interesting to note from the NFC annual reports that the NFC has suffered from the knock-on effects of industrial disputes involving people with which it deals, such as suppliers.</p>
	<p>A most telling point was made by Lord Greene and Harry Urwin. They said that the industrial relations of the NFC had not got into the headlines. We on this side of the Committee fear that there will be headlines if the present structure is dismantled when the industry goes into private ownership. The only headlines about industrial relations in this country relate to bad industrial relations. We want no headlines about industrial relations in the NFC. We believe that what is proposed is likely to lead to bad headlines.</p>
	<p>Ministers will say that they propose to rely on the provisions of the Employment Protection Act. Since my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) is sitting so close to me I am loth to attack the provisions of the Employment Protection Act. That Act covers all other industries at present but it does not, nor can it, produce the good industrial relations that prevail within the NFC. I should have thought that it would appeal to people who call themselves Conservatives to let well alone. The industrial relations structure in the NFC is thriving and is best left alone. The best way to leave it alone is to leave the structure in schedule 6 for the new owners to operate.</p>
	<p>It is important, particularly as we do not know who will buy into the NFC, that there is an existing structure. People will buy shares in the NFC. They will not be accustomed to a reasonable, organised and successful scheme of industrial relations in their existing companies. If they operate in many spheres of British industry, they will be accustomed to bad, disorganised, industrial relations, leading to low productivity and over manning, from the point of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1684</span>
view of management, let alone the unions.</p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>We suggest that there should be a readymade structure, which has proved its worth over more than a decade, and which involves responsible bodies negotiating on behalf of the trade unions, discussing terms and conditions, providing for the resolution of disputes and holding discussions and joint consultations on efficiency and other matters. I cannot think why the Ministers do not want that.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member referred to a structure. I find it difficult to understand how these provisions can be regarded as any kind of structure. Is he saying that their inclusion in legislation will make a difference to the way in which the successor company deals with its employees?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I am saying that. As the hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) should know, there are two sides to industrial relations. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and I are sponsored by the National Union of Railwaymen and are advised by it. The NUR is worried about the possibility of some bright guy—some asset stripper or even some private sector transport operator—whizzing in and thinking that he can impose on the new company his bright shining new 1980-version of industrial relations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An 1880s version.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend—an 1880s version is probably more like it, because that is the approach of the asset strippers who may try to come into the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I have couched my remarks in this way is that this structure, besides being of advantage to the organised trade unions in the NFC, is of significant advantage to the management. The company is to receive all sorts of dowries from the Government. It is to have a £100 million capital write-off. There has been talk of its being able to carry forward the tax losses incurred while in public ownership. We believe that the best dowry that we can give it is a sound structure to assist in giving it good
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0914">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1685</span>
industrial relations so that it can continue being a productive industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer again to what was said in 1973—complacency can bring disaster. If the Minister says that we should rely on the Employment Protection Act, that indicates his complacency. I do not think that anyone in this country, faced with an industry or unit of industry in which there is already good relations, can argue that the existing structure should be done away with for doctrinaire reasons. That is the only reason that can be given. We must try, in what has been an era of poor industrial relations, to make sure that what is good remains and avoid it being turned bad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who looks at the NFC's record must recognise that it is an oasis of good industrial relations in the road transport industry. It provides good working conditions for its employees. I suspect that one of the reasons why the Ministers do not want to include this provision is that they know that those who will try to buy into the industry will not be interested in a structure that will assist them in producing an effective road transport company. They would be interested in getting at the assets in land, in asset stripping and getting rid of the employees. The last thing that they would want is any sort of statutory obligation to consult, or any obligation over and above the Employment Protection Act to conduct industrial relations in a proper organised way with the employee's representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I am convinced that the Ministers will say that they cannot accept this proposition. Those who buy into the company will want only to close it down and sell it off. That is one of the reasons why the unions in the industry are so concerned about their members' jobs. They want to try to avoid an endless struggle, when a structure such as that already existing would help to ensure good industrial relations and that the NFC with roughly 10 per cent, of the road transport industry, would be able to continue to make an efficient and worthwhile contribution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) said, I suggest that a Conservative Minister would not argue that the Employment Protection Act made the amendment unnecessary. When the Conservatives were
	<span class='label label-info column'>1686</span>
in Opposition and the then Labour Government were pushing through the Employment Protection Bill, I found them hostile to virtually every provision mirrored in the part of the Transport Act 1968 with a bearing on the matters dealt with in the amendment. They still retain that hostility towards the employment protection aspects of this amendment. There is no indication that they have changed their views. They have already set about repealing certain provisions of the Employment Protection Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the existence of that Act, or the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, makes a case for opposing the amendment. In some ways, the part of the Transport Act 1968 that prompted us to table the amendment, was remarkably far seeing, and anticipated subsequent legislation. It certainly touched upon some of the difficult areas covered by the Conservative Government's Industrial Relations Act. It also covered one of the aims of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act in regard to the establishment, maintenance and operation of machinery for the promotion and encouragement of measures affecting safety, health and welfare of those employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To that extent, legislation has altered the need for one provision of the 1968 Act. My hon. Friends have clearly taken that into account. They have not sought to repeat in the amendment that part of the 1968 Act, recognising that that was not a point of controversy and that a Conservative Government would not be likely to try to wipe out the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is left to be dealt with, and what is covered by the amendment, are those areas that are crucial to the maintenance of the psychology, practice, trust and understanding that underlie the good industrial relations in the NFC which we want to be carried on in the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition believe that what was created in respect of good industrial relations practice in the NFC owed much to the fact that it is a publicly-owned operation, and therefore covered by a statutory obligation to ensure that. Nevertheless, we take the view that the loss as a public asset of that part of the road transport industry should not have as a concomitant the loss of the great advantage of the application to any other area of road freight transport of arrangements that make for good industrial relations. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0915">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1687</span>
believe the issue to be crucially important, and there is nothing that we can see to suggest that it will become less important in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A well-organised efficient hire and reward sector in freight transport depends to a considerable degree on its reliability. Any failures, as a result of bad industrial relations, to produce the service that the hire and reward sector of road freight haulage is selling must be damaging to its long-term prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that the National Freight Corporation, with its extremely good industrial relations, has managed to operate in ways which were previously considered suitable only for own-account operations. An example which I am sure will not come amiss with Conservative Members is that of Marks and Spencer. It uses a fleet of vehicles carrying its trade mark but which is operated by NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that Marks and Spencer would not have looked to any freight company for that sort of agreement unless it felt that it would not be jeopardised by a series of strikes and that that part of its business would not be put at risk. It would not want a contractual arrangement for deliveries with any organisation other than one that it could be reasonably confident would operate without a series of disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the nature of the industry. It is difficult to organise. Contracts are made almost on a day-to-day basis. But there is a high-quality end of the market, for which people are prepared to pay—that is, a reliable service that is operated by those who have faith and confidence in their employment agreements and which enable them to do a good job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore the points arising from the amendment are just as crucial to the successor company—if not more so—as to the NFC. There is an element of stability in the organisation which may be seen to be at risk through its transfer into private hands. At that point of transfer, confidence that such continuing agreements which produce such good industrial relations are not to be set at risk would be helpful to the Minister. I believe that it is in his own interest to accept the amendment, because it will make it easier for him to sell the company in the way that he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he turns down the amendment and that results in its becoming much harder to sell the NFC—or, taken in conjunction with certain other aspects of the Bill, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1688</span>
becomes impossible and the corporation remains in public hands—we shall shed no tears. In fact, we should be delighted. We are merely trying to help the Minister meet his aims. Surely it must be within the Minister's aims for the company to be regarded as one that will operate efficiently and with good industrial relations, and which can therefore be bought with some confidence that the position will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those are the Minister's aims, surely he cannot object to any of the four specific provisions in the amendment. The first concerns the settlement by negotiation of terms and conditions for those employed. That is one of the straightforward aims set out in the amendment. On the second, he cannot object to the resolution of disputes within the meaning of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. Surely that definition applies to the whole operation of National Freight Corporation. It might go wider, but I believe that it certainly covers the sort of dispute that we would want to see avoided through proper negotiation of terms and conditions, with machinery that works well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that our proposed paragraph 2(	<i>c</i>) would be even more attractive to the Minister. The unions are being bound to the proposition that they must be involved in promoting the efficiency of the operation. It means that they will have a direct interest and responsibility in promoting NFC's productivity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is something about which National Freight Corporation has been remarkably successful. Its records for the past four years show that the output per employee has gone up steadily. Year by year the return on capital per employee has also risen steadily. That would not have been possible without good industrial relations and the negotiating procedure which enabled the management and unions to work out those changes in the activities of employees that were necessary to secure it. The final element of the amendment can give the Minister no difficulty. Surely the matters of mutual interest now to the parties to the agreements in the industry will remain so when the corporation goes over to the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons, I urge the Minister with such persuasion as I possess to examine the issue favourably and to say, "Let us continue the highly successful operation and amend it to the extent to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0916">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1689</span>
which matters have been overtaken by developments. Let us retain an obligation on the successor company to maintain those very good features picked out from the 1968 Act that have enabled the corporation to form good and constructive industrial relations." By "good" we do not mean that there has been an attempt simply to keep matters as they are. They have been developed to match the challenge of expanding in a market where a great deal of flexibility is required and confidence is reposed in employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a man takes out a wagon, he is driving part of the company's capital. He needs a sense of responsibility not only to his employer but to the whole team of which he is a member. That is a product of good industrial relations which is of inestimable value when seen by customers. It is something on which a financial value can be put only when one compares the contracts of the company which has that asset with those of one that has a poor reputation in that respect. The issue of the amendment is clear. I believe that it deserves a positive response from the Minister, which I hope will now be forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I shall be able to match Labour Members for length and eloquence on the subject. That is not because I do not share their sense of the great importance of good industrial relations in the National Freight Corporation and its successor company. I believe, however, that they are seeking to attach to their amendment a weight and importance that, frankly, is not wanted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to join Labour Members in paying tribute to the extremely good industrial relations which the corporation and the trade unions that represent its employees have succeeded in establishing. I am sure that when one examines the substantial improvements in the corporation's performance in recent years, one will find that good industrial relations have made a great contribution. I also agree that no one in the corporation or in the Government should be complacent about its continuance, nor should the successor Companies Act company be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not think that we would pass a whole morning in discussing the National Freight Corporation without hearing about asset strippers, who the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1690</span>
Dobson) believes are lurking behind every truck, waiting to rush out and sell off the NFC's property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He will recall from earlier debates that only he believes in the existence of these asset strippers. There is every likelihood that the corporation, when it becomes a private sector company, will continue to develop as a successful load haulage business. At least, that is our hope. Clearly, any successor company, if well managed, will hope to maintain the present good industrial relations and, if it has any sense, will devote a high proportion of management time and effort to ensuring that it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that a successor company, because it has become a Companies Act company with a change of ownership, will suddenly begin to abandon the negotiating machinery, the present recognition rights of the trades unions in the industry and the present disputes procedures. We can dismiss fears that the company would embark at any stage on such changes of policy, because the commercial consequences of trying to destroy good industrial relations arrangements of the kind it will inherit would be catastrophic. Such fears are ill-founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real point at issue between us is not one of fundamental objective or a difference in the regard in which we hold the good industrial relations record of the corporation. It is whether such wordy and worthy language written into the statute as a legal obligation on a private sector company will make a helpful contribution. I regard the amendment as utterly pointless, and I say that with no disrespect to the hon. Member who moved it. It would be adding to the Bill a statement that was not at all precise in its wording, but instead charging the company, in rather vague and general terms, to set up a machinery to achieve objectives which the corporation is quite happily now achieving, and which one can expect a successor company to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transition from a corporation to a private sector company will be a transition which will share all the usual characteristics of a private trading Companies Act company which we hope will be reasonably successful and employ good industrial relations for its benefit and that of its employees. We do not propose to saddle this private sector company with statutory obligations either of a meaningless and pointless kind, or of a kind that could give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0917">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1691</span>
rise later to legal or other disputes. I do not think that the amendment could give rise to practical consequences of any kind, but it is risky for the Committee to start writing into a Bill rather profuse wording of this kind which could give rise to legal or other dispute that could be of no benefit to anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Committee agrees that the corporation enjoys good industrial relations. We trust that the successor will maintain them too, and we do not feel the need to write in 12 or 15 lines of somewhat turgid and unnecessary prose to achieve this objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I usually listen closely to the Parliamentary Secretary and often enjoy his contributions, but I can only give him three out of 10 for that. Perhaps he would like to don his coat and walk out of the room and down the corridor and impart the advice he has given to this side of the Committee to members of his own party examining the Employment Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary's contribution was peppered with the words "think" and "hope", but never with "will". This provision should be specifically written in. Eleven years ago, because another Committee thought fit to write something into the 1968 Act, it became a model for the industry. Arising from that, the machinery for negotiation was set up across the board on two fronts—one for negotiating—which is important—and the other for consulting. That has worked successfully for 11 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government admit that NFC's industrial relations are good. What, then, will people think when we specifically write out of the Bill something which was laid down in 1968 which led to the setting up of those good industrial relations which the Parliamentary Secretary freely admits exist? If there is little disagreement between us here, what is wrong with writing it into the Bill or leaving it in the 1968 Act? If it had been left in the 1968 Act it would not have to be written into this Bill, but the Government went to the specific trouble of taking it out. Having taken it out, the Parliamentary Secretary has the audacity to say that he hopes that the successor company will have good industrial relations. If it is put into the Bill, his wording can be changed from "hope". There will be no need to hope because it will be specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1692</span>
People outside this House—for example, the employees of NFC—see that we are specifically writing out of legislation something which has existed there for 11 years. They feel suspicious about it because they have worked well with management in consultations and negotiations. Then suddenly along comes a measure to write out, not leave alone. They begin to wonder what the Government are about in writing out something which has worked well for 11 years and, but for the Government, would continue to work well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having got rid of the parts of NFC that are profitable—that is what is behind all this—we seek to impose long-tested machinery on the successor company, and we think that that is right and proper. The Government should emphasise the good side of the trade union movement and the machinery that it has built up, and not only its bad aspects, which is what seems to be happening along the corridor on the Employment Bill. There is no reluctance to write into that Bill long passages on restraint and such matters, but when it comes to the positive aspects, the Government delete them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will have second thoughts. It is not only a question of what we write into the Bill. What people outside think should also be considered. Many employees are suspicious of what the Government are seeking to do, whereas before there was no such suspicion because there was a good working arrangement between workers and management. If we agree that that is satisfactory, what is wrong with imposing it on a successor company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to the Parliamentary Secretary speak about this delicate area of industrial relations, about which all Members of the House profess concern, they having varying degrees of experience in such matters—mine is seafaring, which is an area of transportation—I reinforce the point made by my hon. Friends. There is further new evidence of the feeling within the industry of dissatisfaction with the framework in which our industrial relations are conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government argue that there has to be a fair understanding of the law and that industrial relations should be within the framework of law. That is the whole purpose of the Employment Bill that is being discussed along the corridor. Whether or not the language is turgid, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0918">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1693</span>
whole purpose of the legislation, apparently, is to make clear to people who do not fully understand it, the proper interpretation of picketing, depending on the role of pickets and how one views it. What is not in doubt is that we are using law and the language embodied in legislation to try to spell out clearly—although Heaven knows how legislation ever does it—what people's rights are in specific industrial relations situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, my right hon. and hon. Friends wish to restore to the Bill the legislation that is embodied in the 1968 Act. The Parliamentary Secretary's argument is that one does not necessarily need that, because each employer wants good industrial relations and therefore we should not worry too much about it being embodied in legislation. I do not think that this provision was opposed by the then Tory Opposition in 1968—I am open to correction, but I think that I am right in saying that. So there was endorsement by both sides of the House of the necessity at that time to include it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that legislation is believed by the parties concerned in industrial relations to be a guarantee of fair industrial relations practice, that in itself is a good reason for leaving it in the Bill, because albeit the Minister is saying that these conditions will continue, nothing would be lost by carrying the amendment. That would offer an assurance, particularly to the union side, that the good industrial relations achieved by unions and management in the industry, are guaranteed in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a member of the Select Committee that reported on the National Freight Corporation in 1972–73. One of the amazing things was to receive letters which I believe are unprecedented in any other industry. In Appendix 1 on page 263 of the Select Committee's report are letters received from Jack Jones, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, Sidney Greene, general secretary of the National Union of Railwaymen and D. A. MacKenzie, acting for Mr. Coldrick, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association. The letters are in reply to an invitation to give evidence on industrial relations in the industry, and the language used in them is remarkable. There is a fulsome letter from the TGWU. The letter from Sidney Greene says:
	<span class='label label-info column'>1694</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Union's relationships with the National Freight Corporation are good, and there is nothing outstanding with them that we cannot clear in the course of normal negotiations. In view of these circumstances we do not wish to give evidence to the Sub-Committee."</p></blockquote>
The letter from Mr. MacKenzie of the TSSA states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would indicate, however, that relations between this Association and the Corporation are good and any difficulties we have are dealt with within the Machinery of Negotiation and Consultation."</p></blockquote>
Those letters were from unions in an industry which had suffered a 15,000 decline in manpower in the three or four years prior to the inquiry. I am sure the Minister is well aware of that, as he is fully conversant with the report. There has since been a further reduction in the labour force of 15,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can bring to mind other industries in this country faced with manpower difficulties. Steel is the most evident at present. I do not intend to make any comment on the steel industry, but industrial relations in that industry were very much complicated by a change in management. One cannot assume that a change in management does not have an effect on industrial relations. We all know that a good company can have a satisfactory history for a time, but a change of management brings with it a change in policy and that that most sensitive area of industrial relations can be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must accept that the new company will bring a change in management. That is the whole purpose of the Bill. The new management may have a different attitude towards industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment calls for an obligation which has existed since 1968 to be included in the Bill. The trade unions believe that this guarantees them their rights and has led them to co-operate in most difficult decisions on reducing manpower and getting the corporation back on its feet—so much so, that it is now seen as a successful candidate to be sold off. The only argument by the Parliamentary Secretary against acceptance of the amendment is that it is not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be the Parliamentary Secretary's belief and judgment, but the unions, and perhaps the management, believe the obligation to be important. It is the philosophy of the Government that there should be understanding within the framework of law and I cannot see why—a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0919">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1695</span>
reason has not yet been given—the amendment should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, I find the Government's response extraordinary. The point I sought to make when moving the amendment was that it is traditional in Bills relating to the railway industry to carry forward structures and undertakings which have previously existed for the benefit of management and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good Conservative argument that if it has been done in the past someone must discharge a burden of proof for not continuing to do it in future. The same applies to the system of industrial relations which prevails in the NFC. Industrial relations have been uniquely good. We seek to carry forward the structure that has made that possible. But we are told by the Parliamentary Secretary that he does not accept the idea and that he does not want to saddle the new company with this structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the management of British Leyland would love to be saddled with the structure that exists in NFC, and to have the industrial relations record of the NFC. Dozens of companies in this country would love to be saddled with these arrangements. There is nothing they would like better. That applies to the union, too. It is absolutely absurd to do anything that puts those good industrial relations in jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and hon. Friends do not claim that industrial relations will inevitably plunge into a bottomless pit if the amendment is not accepted, but that is possible. Anything which jeopardizes the present set-up is gratuitous stupidity. The existing arrangements have worked well for the people employed in the industry, for the management and for the customers of the industry. It is, therefore, manifestly absurd not to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that although most people want good industrial relations, some of those who buy companies may not set up the machinery. Two points arise. First, as I have repeatedly said, we legislate not for the 98 per cent, who are good employers but for the 2 per cent. who are bad. By making the amendment one removes any temptation for the bad employer to avoid his responsibilities. Second, a new employer may want to set up a different organisation to that to which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1696</span>
the employees have been used for a long time, and that creates problems. By including the proposals in the amendment one can argue forcibly that one is carrying out the terms of the 1968 Act and that the machinery exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely. It is for the Government to show that the provision is damaging. We do not believe that it is, but to reject the amendment will be damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When, 'as seems extremely likely, industrial relations in the new company decline, I hope that Government Members will not moan about the trade unions and go on about trade union irresponsibility. The most irresponsible action which will have promoted the whole possible decline is the failure of the Government to accept the amendment. The amendment is strongly supported by the trade unions presently involved with the NFC. They comprise half the negotiating machinery. Although we have not consulted, there have been no indications of dissent from the management of the NFC. We have had communication with the management of the NFC but there are certain subjects on which, being matters of political contention, it is not appropriate to commit the management or obtain its views. The management does not want publicly to say that the Government's proposals are barmy. No doubt it would offend Government Members if the management told the truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was laughter when my hon. Friend said that we had not consulted the management. The management has had 16 years in which to renegotiate, if it had dissented. That is surely the best judge of this negotiation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite agree. We have made the point today, and no doubt we shall make it again when the freight transport industry is in discussion. Some parts of the industry have appalling industrial relations. If there is a decline in the standard of industrial relations and an increase in disputes and in difficulties over improving productivity, staff reductions and working arrangements in the NFC, the responsibility will lie with the Minister of Transport and the Parliamentary Secretary. It will be their responsibility because they will have taken the decision

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is time for the Committee to reach a conclusion on this amendment, although I have listened with interest to the further points made. We got on to rather curious ground about the relationship between this and the Employment Bill being discussed along the corridor. The Opposition seemed to be arguing that good industrial relations in the corporation were created by the law and by the specific provisions of a statute of 1968. If that is their belief, so be it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, however, believe that good industrial relations in the National Freight Corporation have been created by the common sense and good judgment of the management and of the trade union leaders. I have already paid tribute to the achievements of the corporation during what has been a very difficult time for it—there has been demanning on a considerable scale and the corporation has faced very competitive and difficult market conditions—in preserving good industrial relations and bringing the corporation back towards recovery. There is no reason why that should change for the worse after the passing of the Bill, so long as the management and trade union representatives continue in the attention that they have given to industrial relations.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1698</span>
	<p>believe that some dramatic change in the character of the company or even in the make-up of the present management will take place when it becomes a private sector company. The change may have great symbolic and political significance to the hon. Gentleman, but it will not work in that way. The present management of the corporation will not vanish when it becomes a private sector company. Indeed, the present management is strongly in favour of the changes proposed in this legislation. I refer to de-nationalisation.</p>
	<p>The structure of the company will change from that of a nationalised corporation to that of a private sector company, but it will continue to be managed, I trust, with prudence and care. It will continue to develop as a road haulage business, and everybody involved should feel under a duty to maintain good industrial relations as a part of that. The Opposition amendment, whether one sees it as a burden or a benefit, is not required. Success will not depend upon wording of this kind written into the statute. It would be quite inappropriate for a private sector company to have attributed to it this very vague and not very worthwhile statutory duty. I therefore invite my right hon. and hon.
