	<div class='page-header'><h1>TRANSPORT BILL</h1></div>
	<p>[Continued from col. 1412.]</p>
	<p>9.55 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[	<i>Mr. Fowler.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the Bill be further considered this day at half-past Three o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret the need to move this motion. It does not give me any pleasure to do so. But we have made very disappointing progress on the last clauses. They are not, by any stretch of the imagination, the most controversial clauses. Nor is this the most controversial part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the first to admit and concede that there are parts of the Bill which are deeply controversial. But no one who reads the clauses we have been debating since 10.30 am yesterday morning can honestly say that they are controversial. I believe that these are sensible public safety clauses, some of which have been drafted with the same words and have the same conditions which have been taken from the legislation of the previous Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, it is a matter of considerable regret that these highly important public safety clauses should have made such small and slow progress through the Committee. We have been sitting here virtually non-stop since 10.30 am Thursday, and we have not yet completed four clauses. It would be less than my duty to accept that. It is unacceptable progress from any objective point of view. For that reason, I propose the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I am normally a reasonable man and talk in moderate terms. But what the Minister now proposes is utterly intolerable and, as far as I can ascertain, totally without precedent. Perhaps you, Mr. Dean, will guide us on the question of precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot find any previous occasion when a Minister has come to a Committee after it has been sitting for this length of time and sought to work, without notice, a procedural manoeuvre which will enable
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1414</span>
him, technically, to end the sitting and extend it within a few hours. The Minister is well aware that that is what he is doing. He knows that by doing so he may well make the role of the Opposition an impossible one. He knows that he has had tremendous aid and facility from the Opposition, and more progress has been made on this controversial Bill in one week than can be pointed to in any other Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are prepared to set this against any reasonable criteria that the Minister likes to pick. He can take Bills going through the House during this Session. He can take other controversial transport Bills as the test. He can compare with one Transport Bill which had 50 clauses the consideration that we have given this Bill. By any of these tests his proposition is totally unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are missing a debate in the Chamber of considerable importance. If we let this matter go now in order to argue properly the proposition before us, we shall not only miss the debate in the House but also the opportunity to prepare for the continuation of our debate that the Minister is proposing. The position put before us is utterly intolerable. I ask you, Mr. Dean, to use your authority to bring the Committee to a close here and now while we take the matter up with Mr. Speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I am not able to do that. The debate can proceed as long as there are right hon. and hon. Members wishing to catch my eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I seek your advice, Mr. Dean, on whether you are under a duty to the Committee to see that it proceeds in accordance with the Standing Orders, rules and precedents established in the House? If that is the case, where is the precedent in the House for what we are now considering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is happening at the moment is perfectly in order. It is not for me from the Chair to quote precedents. This is a matter for argument rather than for a ruling from the Chair. If this motion were to be passed, there appears to be some doubt as to the length of time that the Committee can sit. It seems clear that if the motion were passed, the Committee could sit until midnight. What is not clear to me at the moment—I am taking advice
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0769">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1415</span>
on that—is whether it would be in order, if the Committee so decided, to sit beyond midnight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: However it is expressed, all my hon. Friends on the Opposition Benches, who have far less experience than my right hon. Friend, feel varying kinds of anger. Whatever that anger may be, I want to make clear from the beginning that we consider that the Chair has treated us with great fairness, and we make no complaint there. We do not complain about the procedures that have been used in this Committee. The Government allege that we are delaying the Bill and are not moving at the speed of other Committees. That may question whether we have been in order. You, Mr. Dean, and other Chairmen have ruled as you and they have seen fit; we are governed by your rulings, so whatever the argument may be, we have certainly been in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument is about the substance of our contributions throughout this period. People can go to the record to confirm that whole clauses have come out of the Bill, words have been amended and considerable changes made, bearing in mind the ability of any opposition to change Bills. That reflects on the receptive-ness of the Minister to the arguments on the amendments. We have put on record that we do not have complaints about the receptibility to an argument. That has been prevalent in this 19 or 20 hours of debate. It was the same in the debate on Tuesday: at each stage our arguments have been accepted and there have been amendments and further reflections. That has been the nature of the progress on the Bill. The argument has not been of sterile opposition on ideological positions; there has been give and take; there has been movement; there have been changes in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is arguing that he would be neglecting his responsibilities if he allowed the Bill to continue in this manner. The Bill is almost unprecedented in its speed. As I understand it, the House has only ever worked through into Saturday once, and that was unprecedented on a more controversial Bill than this some years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister makes clear that there are important areas on which controversy will continue to arise—on matters of greater substance than is involved in these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1416</span>
My time in the House is the same as that of the Minister—we both came at the same time—and from my experience, limited by serving in Europe, it has never been practice to judge the speed of a Bill by the controversy of its clauses. I have never heard that principle enunciated by any other Minister or anyone else in the House. Whether or not it is a new principle, brought by the Minister to the Department to reflect the nature of his experience, I must tell him that it is one that no authority in the House will accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always understood that the responsibility that the Minister talks about is to search a clause to the best of my ability and, if I do not agree with its contents, to change it, and, if I do not agree with the amended contents, to vote against them. That is the purpose of a Standing Committee. I defy any hon. Member here, including the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan), to find any part of the Bill wherein there has not been movement, substantial and varying change because the Opposition have carried out their obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We totally reject the Minister's argument. For any parliamentarian to project the argument that where there is acquiescence to a clause it is not to be investigated, discussed and changed is the very antithesis of democracy, and it is a lesson for the Minister to learn. It is an arrogant statement and would be rejected by any thinking parliamentarian in his role in the Opposition of examining a particular Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument seems to be—the Minister did not express it in so many words but this is what he means—that the speed of the proceedings on the Bill is somehow unprecedented. He tries to justify an unprecedented action. What is the record of the speed for which the Minister now submits this motion? Is it that the Committee should continue for another 24 or 48 hours, or that it should have gone on till midnight tonight? No doubt it would then have been possible to table a motion and the Minister would have told us that because we had not moved at the same pace another motion would be required to carry us through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not deployed any argument about the important matter being decided on the Floor of the House today, and the opportunity that we are being denied to participate. We are all well aware of the implications of the Abortion (Amendment) Bill, about which probably most of us have received
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1417</span>
more mail than about any other piece of legislation that I can remember. Admittedly I have seen some abortion legislation, but none of it carried the amount of correspondence for me—or for other hon. Members, from what they tell me—as has Abortion (Amendment) Bill. Millions of people are concerned in the actions of their Members at this moment on the most important conscience clause they will participate in or vote on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Presumably by the rules of this Committee we shall not be denied the possibility of voting in the House, but we shall be denied the chance to listen to the arguments and decide whether the limit should be 24 or 28 weeks, to listen to the experts who have been dealing with the matter and to make considered judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We thought that the motion was to apply from 3.30, but presumably we shall adjourn immediately if the Government win the vote on the motion. Is that correct, Mr. Dean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, absolutely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For as long as the Committee takes to deal with this issue, we are faced with a dilemma. Opposition Members could stop talking, vote and use our right to participate in the debate on the Floor of the House. We can accept that capitulation, or fight this other important principle—though it is probably not as important as the vital principle involved in abortion—namely, that if Oppositions take time to scrutinise legislation and take their time on non-controversial clauses, the new maxim for Committees is "If you don't speed up, you will have to go on and on".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us put some facts on record. We have been discussing the matter of a timetable with the Minister. I shall put our position on record so that it can be fully understood by every member of the Committee and by anyone outside. What were the facts which led to this breakdown? The Minister says that he is not happy to come to the Committee with the motion. But we have been receiving threats all day that we should be here until one o'clock Saturday and Sunday. We take those threats as they come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not with any great sorrow that the Minister puts the motion before us. Let us get rid of the cant. The Minister was sleeping while we were working on his Bill. His hon. Friends might have slept,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1418</span>
too, because they were not prepared to speak. It is a non-controversial clause. Why should they not go and sleep? They do not want to discuss legislation which we have effectively changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How did the breakdown come about? I shall leave the Parliamentary Secretary out of this argument, because the breakdown came with the communication about our discussions with the Minister himself. That, apparently, is where the breakdown arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is known, and it is part of the role of Oppositions and accepted by us, that there comes a time when an Opposition are in disagreement about a Bill, no matter how uncontroversial. A more controversial Bill will extend the area of disagreement. Any Bill that denationalises a nationalised company is as controversial as can be, and a Bill which fundamentally changes the bus industry in with the consequences that we have attempted to point out, is controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some days ago—probably two weeks; perhaps the Committee will bear with me if I do not remember the date—discussions took place as the result of a joint request across the Committee when the motion was moved that the Committee should meet in the afternoons with open sittings. The argument began to develop: what can we discuss on a timetable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was concerned to get his Bill through in a certain time. It was quite a respectable proposition. We were concerned to delay it for our reasons. At the same time, we requested certain matters for co-operation. Those are matters of judgment that each of us can make. Should a Government be prepared to concede something on a Bill to facilitate the demands of the Opposition? It is a judgment that must be made. If it is thrown out and not accepted, one has to consider that situation. But those matters are discussed in every Committee along this Corridor, whether in debates on how many days will be given for the Report stage or on an amendment from a body that is pressing the Opposition to take it up. It may deal with pensions, for instance. Behind that word pensions is an awful lot of bad feeling in certain quarters of this Committee, because of suggestions that some people had prescriptive rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But they are matters of motive rather than fact. We are concerned with what we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0771">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1419</span>
have discussed with the Minister. He said "We are taking rather long on this Committee". At that stage, I think, we were in the eight or ninth sitting on a Bill that was two or three times larger than some of the equally controversial Bills which also denationalised, such as the British Aerospace Bill, the Industry Bill or the Education (No. 2) Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the facts? It is a matter of record, as hon. Members opposite must admit, how many amendments are on our Amendment Paper compared with the number on some of those Bills. It has not been the Opposition's policy to go for a blanketing of amendments. Hon. Members taught me a valuable lesson that will live for me for the rest of the time I stay here. I was soft. But it is a matter of fact, from the actual record of amendments that have been dealt with in this Committee, that they have been few compared to the amendments on other Bills. In many cases, the amendments were suggested by various interests such as the National Bus Company and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been comments to the effect that we seem to be putting forward a National Bus case, or a case for another body that gives us amendments. We happen to agree with those amendments, and we put them forward. That is another indication that we did not adopt what is traditionally done in Committee. That may be put down to our inexperience, but I have learnt a lot, listening to the wise counsels of my right hon. Friend. We were caught in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did we adopt that approach? Because we were discussing with the Minister the reasonable proposition when the Committee was to finish its business, so that the Minister could say to the usual channels "You will have the Bill by this date." Each side of the House, when it is in government, has to plan its business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be naive if we did not believe that both sides—and I have had periods of Opposition and Government on the Back Benches here—have made attempts through Committees to clog up business. It appears to be a parliamentary process which eventually leads to the loss of a Bill. We have lost Bills by that process. That seems to be a legitimate objective. I am assured by hon. Members on both sides of the House that it is a tactic in which we have all taken part. We have either acquiesced in it or played a positive part,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1420</span>
depending on our attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Porter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I went to school in the constituency of the hon. Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter). It is not the most beautiful spot in the world, but I recall it fondly. It is fair enough for the hon. Member to shake his head, because he is in the process of seeing what happens now. When his party goes into Opposition—if the hon. Gentleman is here; I do not think he would be if the Tory Government went out—he will see the opposite side of the coin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my comparison with other Committees. What has been the speed of this Committee compared to other controversial Committees that have gone through the night?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my concern to see how reasonable the Minister's arguments were, I questioned members of those Committees and was told that they went through a second stage—from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.—in their sittings motions. Ministers on those Committees did not seek open motions as did the Minister of Transport. He was provocative from the beginning about the motion. We jumped straight from an ordinary sitting into an open-ended sitting. It is legitimate for Government to do that, but I am trying to compare Committees to see whether we have been unreasonable, because that is the heart of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we first opened our discussions with the Government I looked at the other sittings. We had nine sittings. Others had started earlier so I had to refer to the record in the Library of the ninth sitting. We were making a fair comparison between the Transport Bill Committee and the Committees on the Education (No. 2) Bill, the Industry Bill and the British Aerospace Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that information was put to the Minister when we first met to discuss the sittings and it was pointed out that we were terribly slow. I do not think that he mentioned it after that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the ninth sitting, cur Committee was debating the third clause. The Industry Bill Committee was on clause I, and I believe that it stayed there until the 11th sitting. The Aerospace Bill Committee was on clause 3, exactly the same pace as us. The Education (No. 2) Bill Committee, to be fair, was on clause 7. At an early stage, agreement had been reached between the two sides which allowed progress on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0772">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1421</span>
basis of certain understandings. That partly explained why they were on clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point it is fair to ask, what was the size of the Bills in each case? In the Transport Bill there are 57 clauses, in the Education Bill 31 clauses, in the Industry Bill 18 clauses and in the Aerospace Bill 14 clauses. So, proportionately, we have not moved forward at the same speed, but we can argue the opposite view—that because a clause is in a Bill with 57 or so clauses it should not have one-third less time spent on it. It is not my argument, and I do not think that the Committee as a whole would accept the new concept developed by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to illustrate that I have considered the arguments carefully. I have with me the notes that I used when the Minister and I talked together. I told him then that his argument was not reasonable and not borne out by the facts, but that that did not mean that we would not talk about a timetable motion. We were not talking about going through the night, because there is no love on this side of the Committee of sitting through the night. There are no special creatures on this side who wish to sit for so long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman has said about other Bills. Can he explain why the Industry Bill has completed its passage through the House without the guillotine?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They came to an agreement. The issue here is about coming to an agreement. I am trying to establish why things broke down and why we did not reach an agreement. Why could the Industry Bill Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this blackmail?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East, seems to be conceding that for what he regards as legitimate political reasons, the tactics of the Opposition are deliberately to delay progress in Committee. He is giving as his reason the fact that we have failed to reach agreement. By that I assume he means that we have failed to produce terms acceptable to the Opposition. I do not use the expression that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) used, but the hon. Gentleman is conceding that he is filibustering because we have not met the demands that he has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1422</span>
made and which he thinks are essential to an agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may seem a reasonable summary of the position to Conservative Members, but it is dependent on whether negotiations have broken down and whether there is the possibility of an agreement. Everything hangs upon that and I want to deal with that cardinal point, because it is the major issue of disagreement in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wish to make a further comment about the numbers game on clauses. It was not our fault, although it could be said that we could have accepted the ruling that clause 1 could not be debated. That, too, was an almost unprecedented position, and we received no help from the Minister on a joint submission either to allow amendments, a matter that was within the purview of the Chair to decide, or on some co-operation to deal with clause 1 later—after we had dealt with the matters with which clause 1 was purported to deal, namely, the objects of the Bill. We received no co-operation from the Minister or any Conservative Member in that process. Eventually, by sweating it out, we had a concession agreed that we could amend the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we began to debate. But we had lost two sittings in discussing whether that position could be agreed. Hon. Members should look at what other Committees achieved in debating sittings motions. We spent only one session on that matter when other Committees were taking two and three sessions. We did not want to waste time in Committee as there were many issues in the Bill to be debated. All members of the Committee know the argument about the delay at the beginning of our deliberations. The choice of the sittings motion was not ours—we tried to make things easier for the Minister by going into afternoon sessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not plead on those points, but it must be conceded that on the issue of the sittings motion it is a matter of record that the Opposition's attitude in the Committee has been one of co-operation compared with other Committees. Hon. Members do not have to accept my word for that, as may be seen from the records of the other Committees. The reason for our attitude was that the Committee was to deal with a Bill which, for political reasons, was split into road and rail. I know of no hon. Member on this side of the Committee,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0773">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1423</span>
particularly among those hon. Members sponsored by their respective, unions, who want to incur the possibility of a guillotine. We did not want to find ourselves in a position where we had no time to debate the problems of rail. That dilemma was constantly in our minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was honest and said that there were certain difficulties about budget requirements. I shall not go into detail on that matter, since I do not want to breach any confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was important to the Minister to get the Bill by a certain date—an objective sought by every Tory Minister, through the Whips, in every one of our Committees. We entered into discussions in a good spirit, as I am sure the Minister will agree, and there were no recriminations. At the first meeting, we said, "We should like to make certain requests of you." There was the matter of pensions, about which the unions were concerned. That was not asking a great deal of one provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister himself was concerned and, as I understand it, had made a public statement to the unions involved, saying that he wanted to give some indication of the problem of co-operation. I believe that the Minister genuinely intended that, but he had a problem with the Treasury. We need say no more than the word "Treasury" in the Committee—that means that there are real difficulties for Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognised that, and the Minister did not promise anything. He said that he would look at the matter, but he made no promises to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But on the basis of that and other matters we reached an unconditional agreement about the process in the Committee. Hon. Members will know that we finished early at one stage. The days are getting lost in my mind, but we completed 10 clauses in one day, as we had promised. There was mention at one time of how many clauses should be completed in a week, because we could not agree a timetable until the end of the week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we still want agreement and the Minister feels he has to move forward, we must co-operate with him to show good will. We completed 10 clauses on one day. So good was the co-operation that we also agreed to run through four clauses, as we were behind time, on an agreed formula with the Minister. The hon. Gentleman, the Government Whip and the Parliamentary Secretary will confirm that that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1424</span>
was the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want the Minister to listen carefully to what I wish to make clear. We have kept every promise that we have given. I am sure that the Minister will agree publicly what he agrees privately. There has been no disagreement about that matter. The disagreement came when on Tuesday we asked the Minister to look at a clause and tell us whether he was favourably disposed to help us. He said that he would look at it, but he did not promise anything. He did not commit himself. He said clearly that he did not feel that the Government should be negotiating on the clauses to give anything. We understood that, but he had to balance what we might ask for in order to get the Bill out on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way of getting a Bill out of Committee on time is with the co-operation of the Opposition. No new principle is being breached. But if an Opposition become more truculent their only weapons are anchors. That procedure has occurred in every Standing Committee dealing with Government Bills—every Bill of every Government every year. It has been referred to as the parliamentary practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did the practice break down on Tuesday? The Minister told us that he would investigate other matters. We accepted that he was in difficulty about pensions. We could see the problem. The unions had particularly strong feelings about a pension agreement—we shall debate that when we come to the relevant clauses. The only reason that amendments were suggested to us in Committee was that the Government had refused them in the early stages of consultation and the unions came to us in an attempt to get changes included in the Bill. That is a normal practice that interested parties involve themselves in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We told the Minister that we understood his difficulties with pensions, but that some of our people were not happy. We asked him to look at other matters such as the National Freight Corporation, which we shall debate in the Bill. These are matters of concern that have been guaranteed by other legislation. The Minister said that he would look at them but he did not say that he would agree with our views. We would not expect a Minister to give us that sort of undertaking and when the hon. Gentleman was in opposition he would not have expected a Labour Minister, to negotiate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0774">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1425</span>
agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the margin there is some understanding to pass the Bill by a certain date, against what we consider might be a negotiating ploy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What went wrong on Tuesday was that we were told that nothing more could be done about the National Freight Corporation, pensions or the other matters. Therefore we should have to resort to infighting, which shall be read as an intention to continue to debate and examine the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That started on Tuesday. We have always made clear that we are interested in timetable motions. The Ministers do not disagree. The Machiavellian right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) should sit down while another hon. Member is speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has always been talking from this side of the fence. We again met the Minister on Wednesday. We met him on his own, this time, except for the Government Whip and the Opposition Whip. Again it was an amicable meeting, fully in the spirit of co-operation. Indeed, I do not think that I have had a bad meeting with the Minister. He has shown himself to be willing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was one distinctive and fundamental change: it was a change of attitude. I think that the attitude was influenced by other people's opinions which have predominance in the counsels of Government Members. That is normal. It happens on both sides of the Committee. But what was different on this occasion was that the Minister considered that he could take his Bill much further, that we were on the ropes and that the Committee would take 10 or 11 clauses, as he did in one sitting. That is unprecedented in Standing Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I defy even the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) to tell us of any Committees of which he has been a member which have taken 11 clauses in one sitting—never mind 20. I ask him to recall, with all his experience both as a Minister and as a Member of the House, when a Committee dealt with 11 clauses so quickly—controversial or non-controversial ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a fair point and the essence of the point. We had not put down the traditional kind of blanket amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I learnt some valuable lessons from the exercise. I am sorry about it, because when one puts down blanket amendments, all the staff on the Minister's side can give him an argument on every one of them. The staff of this Committee and of the House and the printers found that our load of amendments was considerably greater than before. They encouraged others to go further and we realised it as quickly as anybody. When one is in that position, one realises what the game is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a distinctive change in response. The result was that a lot of amendments were selected by the Chairman and we dealt with them. We are at this stage today and I note that things are moving. We have always been open to a timetable arrangement and the blame for a breakdown in negotiations is not to be found with us. I shall finish there, because there appears to be movement of some kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
