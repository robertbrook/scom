	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 183, in page 46, line 14, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"which is available to the general public".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 341, in page 46, line 19, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"any service in receipt of support by transport supplementary grant individually or as part of a network support-system shall be deemed as within the meaning".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that it will be helpful if I indicate the background considerations which apply to amendment No. 341 and, to a limited extent, to amendment No. 342. In a sense, they are probing amendments and arise from our inability to discern with exactitude the purpose of the clause. It appears to attempt to keep the law the same by changing the words in the statute. That is to say, it takes account solely of the changes in definition of public services and public service vehicles in clause 3, and recognises that, given that the meaning in law of contract carriage has been changed—as it will be when the Bill has been passed—it will no longer be possible to define eligibility for fuel duty rebate and bus grant in the same way. Therefore, even if it were the Government's intention to retain eligibility for fuel duty rebate and bus grant there would have to be some consequential changes as a result of the passing of part I. However, that only raises the question of whether the Government found, in looking at the new definitions created by clause 3, that it was no longer possible to have the same legal definition of eligibility, or whether it was their intention to narrow the range of eligibility for fuel duty rebate and for bus grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the clause has the latter
	<span class='label label-info column'>2090</span>
effect. The current eligibility is related mainly to the stage carriage services and buses running in them, and the definition of those services is to be found in section 117 of the Road Traffic Act 1960. That definition is different from the definition of "stage carriage" in part I of the Bill. The definition, inasmuch as it bears on the amendments, requires a service to be provided
	<br><blockquote><p>"at separate fares none of which is less than 21p".</p></blockquote>
I do not comment on the merits or demerits of the definition, but I insist that, since that definition differs so much from the present approach, one cannot just substitute one definition for the other and leave the same eligibility for fuel duty rebate and bus grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the definition in section 117 the distance covered by the vehicles in the course of a stage carriage service has no bearing on eligibility, whereas in the definition in part I the dividing line between express carriage and contract carriage—following our amendment to the definition of express carriage—is based on the distance any one passenger is carried rather than the distance between stops. Even that distance is further qualified by the maximum distance the passenger is from the point at which he is picked up or put down in the course of the journey. Therefore, this complex definition bears on the latter part of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the total distance run by the service has no bearing on existing qualification, now that the separation of contract and express carriage, and this peculiar definition, have a bearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other difference as I understand it—I would like the Parliamentary Secretary's advice on this—is that the present eligibility for fuel duty rebate relates solely to the stage carriage. Therefore, only stage carriage services receive refunds on fuel duty. But that is not so with bus grants. They are now to be paid on buses which will be used wholly or mainly for stage carriage services. Therefore, the clause raises the question of exclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One other line of eligibility is affected. Currently there is eligibility for the fuel duty rebate to employers providing bus services at low fares for their workers. That does not appear to be covered by the definitions in clause 51.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other issue that clearly arises is tours and excursions which are not, so far
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2091</span>
as I can discover, eligibility under the present law. I understand that because of the 21p fare limit the contention is that there is no need to write in an exclusion since it is likely in practice to exclude all tours and excursions. However, I cannot see how the mechanics of the clause were arrived at. It refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a service as regards which the condition specified in section 3(3)(	<i>a</i>) of the Transport Act 1980 — is satisfied".</p></blockquote>
Had section 3(3)(	<i>b</i>) been referred to tours and excursions would have been excluded. They are mentioned separately in the definition of "bus service" in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the reference to clause 3(3)(	<i>a</i>) in respect of the express service exclusion. The two are not picked up in the way that clause 3 leads one to expect. That complex consideration of how eligibility is now divided, and the extent to which the clause appears to limit it brings me to the purpose of amendment No. 183.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is intended to preserve eligibility for buses provided by employers to carry workers to and from work. I can see nothing in current public transport developments to justify the Government's proposal to remove that eligibility. I see no evidence that public transport services are expanding so rapidly that employers will no longer need to lay on such buses. There is no reason to suppose that in future such provision will be any less expensive than it has been in the past. On the contrary, the indications are that it will be more expensive. In view of that combination of considerations I cannot see why the Government are removing eligibility at this stage. On the basis of my constituency experience I would argue that employers lay on such services only when public transport is inadequate to fill the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, therefore, the proposal threatens one of two undesirable consequences—possibly both. One is that employers' costs will go up as a direct result of fuel duty rebate being withdrawn. The other is that they will be forced to pass on the additional costs to employees. In many areas the issue of employees' fares is sensitive enough already without changes in fuel duty rebate eligibility making matters worse. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will explain to us the thought behind the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2092</span>
exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further complexity arises from the widening definition of contract carriage. In Committee, though not on Second Reading, the Government have made clear their intention greatly to widen the scope of contract carriage. They intend it to be possible to run a regular service between fixed points every day as part of a normal contract carriage arrangement. That is a completely new concept in our law. It led me to assume that there would be an option for such services to be provided on a contract carriage basis. But if that is so the Government must tell us whether their intention in so doing is to reduce the proportion of bus passengers eligible for bus and fuel grants. Is their intention that anyone setting up a contract arrangement for the provision of buses to take workers to work—or for any other regular service—should be denied the fuel grant that has been available to them until now? If so, they should say so, and explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A much wider issue is raised by amendment No. 341. The Opposition feel that here is an opportunity to bring much more rhyme, reason and sense, as well as a degree of local democratic control, to the question of eligibility for bus grants and fuel duty rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the law stands, statutory duties are laid upon local authorities to promote good, efficient, co-ordinated passenger transport networks within their areas. The degree of obligation varies according to the area, but I shall not go into that as we discussed it earlier in our proceedings. In some areas, a very precise duty is laid upon the authority. In other areas, the law indicates that it should aim to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In either case, the Opposition believe that if a local authority in pursuit of that duty decides that it is desirable to sustain a total network of services which, individually or as part of a network agreement, it is prepared to bring within the transport supplementary grant payment system, none of those services should be excluded either from the bus grant or from the fuel duty rebate. That is our underlying purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, in a number of areas, a very delicate balance exists which could be seriously disturbed by any withdrawal of fuel duty rebate or bus grants. There are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2093</span>
district councils currently running urban services without the aid of transport supplementary grant because the county will not provide it. However, it is not uncommon in such cases for the county authority to reach an agreement whereby transport supplementary grant is provided for services on the periphery of the urban area but within the area of the district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are respecters of local democracy, as Opposition Members certainly are, we must regard the elected local authority members as being in the best position to judge what is an adequate public transport network in their area. This argument affects rail as well as road services, although the amendment deals only with the road transport aspect. If that duty is laid upon the authorities and they decide that it is proper to use part of their ratepayers" money and that part of taxpayers' money that is made available for transport supplementary grant to support services, it would be an absolute nonsense if any one of those services were disqualified from the bus grant or the fuel duty rebate. It would become no more than a book keeping exercise, as the money would be taken away with one hand and paid back with the other, and it would devalue that element of transport supplementary grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this touches upon the question of works buses, which one would not expect to be directly affected by the transport planning and policy arrangement. However, if I am right in saying that in some areas the only reason for laying on works buses is that there is no public transport network to provide for the workers, there must be a relationship between the two. I remember discussing with workers at Millom, when the steelworks there was closed down, the possibility of their obtaining jobs in Barrow or Ulverston. The first question that they raised was how they could get there, because there was no adequate public transport service. I was forced to go to the transport authorities to ask whether they could lay on additional services for a specific employment requirement arising from the closing of the steelworks. They were not in a position immediately to respond. One result of that was that Lister's textile works in Barrow actually laid on a bus service from Millom to get unemployed steel workers to come and work in Barrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could happen in other areas. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>2094</span>
see possibilities, unfortunately, not just of steelworks closing down, but of other firms collapsing and demands being placed upon public transport services which they will be unable to meet unless the local authorities that operate TSG and have the responsibility for transport planning and policy can bring the advantages of TSG to bear without any fear of the service costs being raised by withdrawal of fuel duty rebate. It is a simple concept but, one that I believe embraces local democracy in a way which I hope members of the Committee will support. In that spirit, I commend the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow up a point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) concerning the withdrawal of fuel duty rebate for works buses. It seems a remarkable decision for the Government to take. As my right hon. Friend said, in nearly all cases works buses are provided only when either the public transport has declined to such an extent that people cannot use it to get to work, or when the place of work would not justify a normal public transport service because it is in an out of the way spot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases works buses are provided in areas where there is a generally low level of car ownership. Those for whom they are provided tend not to receive substantial pay and consequently do not own cars. In any case, even if some potential users of works buses own cars, it seems bizarre to discourage the use of fuel in that economical way—that is, by the use of works buses—at a time when the Ministry of Transport and Department of Energy are trying to ensure that fuel is saved by making people travel to work by bus. I suspect that some of those who formerly worked at Millom would not be able to get to their new place of work in Barrow because they could not afford a car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As costs rise for the public transport system generally and, given the unwillingness of a substantial number of Conservative county councils to provide anything of consequence for the support of local bus services, it seems likely that the need for works buses will increase. Employers will find it increasingly necessary to provide a cheap means of transport for people to get to work. Therefore a diminution in the need for works buses is unlikely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances it seems bizarre
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2095</span>
to withdraw the rebate on fuel for works buses. The Government should consider the impact of their doing that. There is bound to be one consequence. Costs to the employer who provides the buses will rise, in which case one of three things may happen. First, he could withdraw the works bus service. That would be an extreme response to an increase in fuel bills, but it is a possibility. That cannot be good for maintaining the present level of unemployment. Certainly it will do nothing to reduce the ludicrously high level of unemployment that now prevails.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, if a charge is levied on those using the works buses it could be increased. That would not have a favourable impact on wage claims. Third, the employer would have to bear the additional costs arising from the withdrawal of the rebate. If he did that, the general costs of his manufactures or service would be bound to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot assume that the wording of the clause is so obscure that withdrawal of the rebate is an accidental byproduct. Why has it been proposed? I cannot think that the Parliamentary Secretary, even given his normally good response to points we raise, is likely to come up with a convincing reason for withdrawing the rebate. We should also like to know the scale of the sums involved. If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot give us an indication of scale, it makes it even sillier to introduce the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Works buses are provided because they are necessary. This measure makes it more difficult and more expensive to provide them, and anyone who does that in the present circumstances, or in possible foreseeable circumstances, is plain barmy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) was correct in his initial comment that the clause arises out of the redefinition of stage carriage services that we debated on clause 3. Because stage carriage is the basis for eligibility both for new bus grant and fuel duty rebate, it is necessary to bring the eligibility in line with the new definition in the Bill. That is essentially what clause 3 seeks to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had to decide which categories of service ought to be eligible for fuel duty rebate and new bus grants, assuming, as
	<span class='label label-info column'>2096</span>
has always been the case, that the same definition is used for both, as proposed here, and how best to bring that category of service within the definitions that we are now using in the Bill. The best starting point, in order to consider the amendments and decide whether the criteria are too tight, might be to examine the policy that lies behind the new bus grant and fuel duty rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new bus grant was always intended to be a grant towards capital investment in new buses for a temporary period in order to facilitate, in particular, one-man operation of buses. Clearly, the intention and policy of the grant, on which the Government's approach is consistent with that of the previous Government, was to increase efficiency on regular stopping services where a bus conductor would in the past have been employed to collect fares, and where it is now desirable, in the interests of economy and efficiency, to go over to one man operation. That gives a clear indication of what kind of service we ought to have in mind as being eligible for new bus grant when considering the definitions in clause 51.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fuel duty rebate is a non-controversial measure, and everyone agrees that it should be given to a particular category of passenger bus services. It is aimed at local stopping services where a regular public service exists. We all agree that it is in the public interest to give a reduction in its costs by rebating its fuel duty in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the present policy. It is more or less the policy that we have tried to reproduce in the Bill. But there are one or two anomalies. One is the position of works services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no intention on the Government's part to discourage the provision of works services. I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) that many employers find it desirable to take employees to their place of work. They are usually bitterly opposed by the network passenger transport operators. Often I see contested cases which come in by way of appeal when road services licences have been refused to works operators. Where clearly employees have wanted such a service which could not otherwise have been provided, we have been able to encourage and facilitate the provision of one. There are many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2097</span>
throughout the country and it is unwise to consider reducing them now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position on fuel duty rebate is anomalous. Works services fall into two categories and will continue to do so under the Bill as it stands. Some are contract carriage and some are stage carriage. As the law stands, if they are regular services, they cannot be contract carriage if they charge the employees one-third—even if the fare is heavily subsidised by the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the present position is that, normally, where employees pay a fare, whether a full fare or a contribution towards the cost of providing the works bus, it usually operates under a road service licence. Where the employer bears the full cost and the employees are charged nothing, it operates as a contract carriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is anomalous that, at present, some works services qualify for fuel rebate and new bus grant and others do not. I should like to be able to give the Committee an estimate of which is the more numerous, but we have not done a proper survey and are therefore not sure. Those more experienced than me in this field suspect that there are probably more contract carriage than stage carriage. But there is certainly an anomaly which is difficult to justify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When considering which way to go. Reverting to what I said earlier about the underlying policy that led successive Governments to continue new bus grants on a temporary basis and contemplate fuel duty rebate as a permanent feature of passenger transport, I do not think that works buses that were closed to the general public were actually the sort of services that anyone had in mind when they advocated either new bus grant or fuel duty rebate. As regards new bus grant, the works bus is not the kind that usually has a conductor. The introduction of one man operation to works services was not the intention when bus grant was made available. Fuel duty rebate was aimed at the regular local service. It is anomalous that only some works services get the rebate at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We sought to avoid that by putting in the definition—it is the only part of the definition about which anyone was seriously concerned, and no one objected to the exclusion of excursions and tours—that in order to be eligible for the grant and the rebate, the service should be a stage carriage service available to the general public. That will make clear that
	<span class='label label-info column'>2098</span>
it is the kind of local transport operation which ought properly to come within the definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two further points are relevant. I accept that the results of what we are doing will mean that some works services which at the moment get fuel duty rebate, and could conceivably be eligible for new bus grant, will lose the rebate, which is the more important. Operators will then have to decide what to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that where a works service is being provided on a stage carriage basis, usually it is confined to being a works service only because of objections from other operators to its having any kind of general road service licence. Stage carriage services normally exist because of the impossibility of overriding the objections of other operators to unrestricted road service licences in cases that go before the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that when most of the operators of works services face up to the implications of what will be the Transport Act 1980, they will contemplate using the new provisions of the Bill to go before the commissioners and enlarge the service that they wish to provide, primarily for the benefit of their employees, in order to make it available to the general public. They might consider that as a way of getting over the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposed criteria of the Bill, I think that they would find it much easier to obtain a licence, and where they get such a licence the effect will be to enlarge the service available to the general public, going to and from work particularly at peak travel hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A possible side-effect—albeit a minor one—of what we are doing in clause 51 is that some operators of works services on stage carriage licences will decide that they had better get a road service licence to enable them to take fare-paying members of the general public on their services, making them more widely available. The Government's reaction to that is that it may be highly beneficial and result in an enlargement of service to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A second, and more subordinate point than the main policy lines that I have argued—and it will, of course, be argued that all we are doing here is saving money, which is true of some services—is that the effect of clause 51 will be rather neutral. One effect of our redefinition of stage carriage in this Bill, as compared with previous definitions, will be to enlarge to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2099</span>
a modest extent the number of present services that will be defined as stage carriage compared with those defined as stage carriage under previous legislation. To that extent, there will be a somewhat increased liability on public funds arising out of that enlargement. It will be some small compensation, and will probably in the end result in a more or less neutral effect. Some works services which at the moment get into the definition of stage carriage and therefore get the rebate will, because of the anomalous effects of present legislation, be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall effect of clause 51 is not to save large amounts of money to the Treasury or anything like that. I do not have precise figures, but I think that, on balance, what the Treasury gains on the swings it will lose on the roundabouts as a result of our definitions in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is certainly the effect with new bus grant, where there are no financial implications in what we are doing and where there is a cash limit at present. As regards fuel duty rebate, the effect of the Bill as a whole, on services as a whole, will be neutral.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary. He sounds bamboozled, however. He seems to be saying that where there is a works bus the answer is to run a stage carriage service. If that is so will he explain what happens where a works bus runs for the simple reason that it is the only way of getting people to a site because no one else wants to go to it? By that token the fuel grants will be cut from that service because there will be no stage carriage service to a place to which no one wants to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to suggest loopholes in the legislation which people might exploit. But as long as they make the service available to the general public, the fact that the public are not interested in going to some remote site will not affect their eligibility for fuel duty rebate. The only services that are to be excluded by the phrase which is objected to are those which, by their very organisation, are not available to the general public. If a member of the general public cannot be picked up as a passenger, a fare cannot be taken from him. I do not think that the situation envisaged by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans),
	<span class='label label-info column'>2100</span>
will arise. In practice, not very much will alter so long as they remember to get their new road service licence from the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Works buses normally run at rush hours and go through towns and villages to a factory. The main effect will be that a number of such services will have their licences widened so that members of the general public can be picked up and set down on the route when that coincides with passenger needs. I believe that I have made the issue clear in respect of the first amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of our case is that while we realise that we shall be excluding some works services from eligibility, the fact that they were eligible in the first place was an anomaly. Many will be able to sort matters out with no great problems, and those that cannot do that should not have had the rebate at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the second amendment. I can see the issues that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to explore, although the phraseology of the amendment obscures them slightly. There is slight confusion in the wording about how the system works at present. Transport supplementary grant is paid by central Government to local authorities as a contribution towards their transport expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expect that in many cases—and in practice, it already happens with most local authorities—part of what is received by way of grant will be devoted to revenue support for local bus operators, in arriving at the correct figure for a local authority grant we take into account the amount of expenditure that we are prepared to accept for bus revenue support. We do not make counties devote that amount to such a use but usually they do so. Most authorities have a system of bus revenue support and I believe that it is right that they should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment appears to raise the question whether all those services which receive revenue support from local authorities should be eligible for fuel duty rebate and new bus grant. There is no argument between us about the virtues of revenue support. We would like to see that used much more sensibly and effectively by local authorities. As I have stated before, in my opinion the purpose of bus revenue support should be for a local authority to identify those services that are necessary to the travelling public and which need some subsidy from the general
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2101</span>
public for them to be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Bill will, first, enable local authorities to identify such services as are needed and, second, make it possible to examine a range of operators who may at the least cost to public funds provide an adequate service and decide to use their revenue support in what might be called a creative way. That would be done in order to extend a service to the travelling public—particularly to smaller communities in the rural areas, and so on— that might otherwise not be able to maintain themselves from the fares box alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, bus revenue support is often paid on a slightly more broad brush—or network—approach of the type mentioned by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness. That is perfectly defensible and sensible. In practice, there is just one monopoly operator in some counties who says how much he reckons that he has lost each year and insists that the authority picks up the bill that he has run up in that part of his operations. In future it will be for local authorities to work how best to use their bus revenue support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware that revenue support is usually given by local authorities to anything but stage carriage services. I have not spent a great deal of time in examining the matter, but speaking off the cuff I know of no county that devotes revenue support to a bus service that is not a stage carriage service available to the general public and within the definition of clause 51.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman fears that we might be inhibiting the ability of local authorities to support the kind of desirable services that I have mentioned, he is shooting at shadows. I cannot think of an example of the kind of service for which it would be proper for a local authority to use revenue support, or for which a local authority might in practice be tempted to give revenue support, which would fall outside the definition of eligibility proposed in clause 51.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There does not seem to be much between us on the general issue. We all agree that there is a case for revenue support. Probably we all agree about the sensible use of it that county councils ought to make. I do not think that any of that is inhibited by the definition in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2102</span>
Bill. I quite agree that it would be foolish if we were to give public money to subsidise a desirable service with one hand, and with the other refuse to give fuel duty rebate and new bus grant to the same service. However, I cannot see how that could arise in practice. In my opinion our definition is wide enough to cover all the services that local authorities are likely to want to support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I become more and more amazed as I listen to the Parliamentary Secretary. His defence of the removal of the duty rebate for works buses was not one of his more sparkling performances. That is partly because the case that he was trying to argue is so appalling. I have seen the Prime Minister in the role of the Madame Defarge of the quango. Now, apparently, we have the Minister of Transport and the Parliamentary Secretary in the roles of the Danton and the Robespierre of the anomaly. An anomaly has been identified. Therefore, on principle it must be wiped out. It is rather odd. I can see that when the fuel rebates were introduced in 1965, or whenever it was, they may not have been intended to apply to certain categories of works buses. However, that is what happened. There may have been a little shoddy or convoluted drafting at the time. The result was that works buses qualified for the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary represented himself to the electors of Rushcliffe as a conservative as well as a Conservative. However, he now says that because the situation is anomalous, because his predecessor's officials did not intend that it should come about, it never should have come about and must be brought to an end. That seems strange to me. I can only think that the motivation for it is that those who drafted the change in the 1960s, having identified one of their mistakes, are finally getting their own back. The Parliamentary Secretary has admitted that his officials have not the faintest idea of the financial consequences of what they are doing. They cannot say that they are making a contribution to reducing public expenditure, and that this is part of their bid to demonstrate to the Cabinet how good they are at that. The simple truth is that they have identified an anomaly and are determined to blot it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The world is full of all sorts of marvellous anomalies. Many of the anomalies are a damn sight better than the systems.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2103</span>
We should be in favour of this anomaly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several faults in the Parliamentary Secretary's logic. He says that if people wish to qualify, they should start running stage carriage services. But many works buses have come into operation because there was no means other than the works bus to make a certain trip from a housing estate to a works, for example, or—as in the case cited by my right hon. Friend—to transport people who worked in Millom and wanted to get to Barrow at a particular time of day. That was because there was no other demand for transport between those particular points. It was why there was no other form of transport doing the journey in the first place. That follows the theory that demand determines where bus services are provided. That theory is the logical basis of the whole Bill. It is bizarre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say to the people who had the initiative to provide works buses and improve matters for themselves as employers and for their employees "If you want, you can become a public transport operator"—in effect, that is what the Bill says—is adding insult to injury. Think of the extra cost that they will incur. They will need road service licences and, as I understand it, they will have to appoint a qualified transport manager to operate one bus, or possibly two or three buses if it is a large works bringing in people from different directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that that should come from a Government who are making a bonfire of controls—forcing people who are doing a one-off job for a specific purpose on a specific route to turn themselves into transport operators in order to continue to qualify for a grant which they have received, by accident, for more than a decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employers would have to start advertising a regular service. They might have to provide the service during works holidays, because my guess—which is as speculative as the Parliamentary Secretary's speculation on revenue savings—is that many of the works served by works buses are those that close the whole shooting match down for a fortnight or three weeks. Either they will run a very peculiar regular service advertised as "except during works holidays" or, alternatively, they will be forced to continue to run a service when the works are closed. Otherwise, those few people who might be using the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2104</span>
former works bus, and now a stage carriage service, will have no transport during the works holidays and will have to make alternative arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem arises. It might frequently be possible, along parts of a works bus route, to pick up a few passengers. One of the problems in many country areas, particularly where the bus service runs in and out of towns, is that sometimes the bus is filled with people on short journeys. One might end up by running this notional stage carriage service with buses filled up by people who do not want to go to the works, and the people who want to go to the works unable to get on the bus. All the ramifications of this preposterous idea keep flooding in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), specifically asked me—he does not want to speak again in case he hurts his wrist—whether the Minister is aware of how many people from Bedlington and Ashington, or living along the route, other than those working at the Bedlington drift pit, are likely to want to catch the works bus from Bedlington and Ashington to the drift pit. I recognise that the Minister may need notice of that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is ridiculous. We would not crow if the Parliamentary Secretary said "This anomaly has now endeared itself to us. We think it might be permitted to continue because it is beneficial to the people who are using it at present and all alternatives will be either expensive or complicated." I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will agree, because he has been very reasonable in responding to the reasonable points we have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pan-eras, South (Mr. Dobson), on enjoying new bus grants and fuel duty rebates on the scale that he does. Few people are able to derive such pleasure from making speeches on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman identified more and more ramifications as he went on, many of them wide of the mark. He began by criticising my description of the present situation as an anomaly. He did not appear to like the idea of my hunting anomalies in this way and suggests that we should preserve this one. We would need a campaign to sort out such beasts, and we are not going through the statute book busily correcting all the anomalies
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2105</span>
that Parliament has created over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In completely redrafting the law in one respect, as we are here, it is necessary to reconsider exactly what definition we shall have for new bus grants and fuel duty rebates. Where there is a glaring anomaly—I use the word again—in present practice one has to decide how to resolve it, or whether there is any case for continuing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member is not totally clear about the nature of the present position. Opposition members seem to assume that wide ranges of works services are, at the moment, eligible for new bus grants and receiving fuel duty rebate. That is not so. I do not know whether the bus to Bedlington drift pit, as organised at the moment, is eligible for fuel duty rebate. The chances are that it is not. If it is a works service where the cost is paid by the employer, it is operated on a contract basis and is not eligible for rebate. If fares are charged, there is a good possibility that the minimum fare is more than 21p, so it is an express service under the present definition, and is not eligible for fuel duty rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confessed earlier that I do not know how many works services operate under licence as stage carriage services. However, I hazard a guess, or put forward advice, that they are a minority of the present services. It is absurd that by chance some works services now have benefit of the grant, and the bulk of them do not. I shall not repeat the reasons I gave for the redefinition. Where there is an anomaly, it is sensible to refer back to the policy point. It appears that works services have been covered only by accident, and there is no need to continue that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggested a means of solving the anomaly. We are saying only that the services must be made available to the general public. If the bus to Bedlington drift colliery runs at four o'clock in the morning to an obscure part of the world and is, therefore, not in great demand, I should reverse the hon. Gentleman's argument and say that I cannot see the hardship that will be caused to anyone, if the owners operate the service under a road service licence, want to continue to do so and want the vehicle to be classed as a stage carriage, in opening the service to the general public. In practice, nothing will change. Unless the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>2106</span>
Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) can think of some compelling reasons why the miners at Bedlington should wish to push off the bus, old ladies who want to go shopping in the vicinity of the mine, I think that we are discussing a bogus point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the road service licences, one of the objections raised by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) was the necessity of going to all the trouble of applying for a road service licence. That underlines the fact that he has misunderstood the present situation. By definition, the people about whom we are talking have licences from the traffic commissioners now to operate stage carriages. Most of them are restricted only because of the objections of other operators. If fuel duty rebates are really important to them, they have the option of opening their services to the general public. That would be a good thing in providing more services during rush hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened to the hon. Member's entertaining speech, but I do not repent of the desire to sort out the present situation. There is no rhyme or reason in the selection of those works services which happen to have the benefit of grants and those which do not. Because the definition of stage carriage is being slightly enlarged anyway, it is sensible to make it clear that only public services will be eligible in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary is definitely a "horses for courses" man. He uses in this Committee arguments which he would not use if he were pleading in court, particularly if he were in the Court of Appeal before Lord Denning. He would certainly not say "You realise, your Lordship, that this part of the law should not be applied in that way because it is clearly anomalous." He knows what response he would receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen this morning another clever conjuring trick which the Parliamentary Secretary does. We must learn from him. This one is based on the proposition that if one wants to have something rejected, one merely defines or describes it in another way. If one wants to take away a legal entitlement, one calls it an anomaly. The Committee will then vote to get rid of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certain that those who operate these bus services and receive fuel duty
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2107</span>
rebate will say that that is not an anomaly but a legal entitlement having a real and practical effect. They are not concerned about conjuring tricks but about the cost of conveying workers to work and the straight ecomomic and social decisions implicit in deciding whether to charge their workers fares. That calculation will be made taking into account the cost of the bus and of maintaining it, and whether they receive fuel duty rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Parliamentary Secretary has fairly said, one factor which determines whether certain services qualify is the minimum fare provision—whether the fare is less than 21p. I conceded unreservedly, in my original remarks about the amendments, that concerning tours and excursions, although there was not a specific exclusion in existing law, and although, if the clause were passed in its present form; there will be a specific exclusion, in practice the limit of 21p excludes a lot of tours and excursions. However, that same argument does not apply to works fares. A works fare on a works bus is more likely to be less than 21p than is the fare on a tour or excursion. Therefore, the issue is real and practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the effects referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary—and here I take his point very much; he is probably justified in using the term "anomalous"—is that of allowing the public to come on the bus, whether it is a stage or contract carriage, and the appeals which come before him now. The appeals will not come before him for contract carriages in the future if the Bill is passed. That operation will be able to go ahead unrestricted. There will be no requirement even to inform the traffic commissioner. Only where operators use the device suggested by the Parliamentary Secretary will they become liable to the appeal procedure; where they decide that the only way in which they can qualify for fuel duty rebate under the Transport Act 1980, as the Bill will be, to obtain a road service licence and open up their works buses to the public. Then the Minister will again hear appeals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, that underlies our second amendment. The people concerned about the maintenance and network of public services are concerned whether a works service should carry part of the general
	<span class='label label-info column'>2108</span>
public service. That is a difficult decision. I shall not go over all the reasons. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) has outlined most of them well. But, surely, a service which runs purely at the hours suitable for workers, on a route to those workers' places of residence, will not be ideally suited for general public transport. It is a difficult decision whether to appeal against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, that raises the whole question of how far it can, in certain limited circumstances, be advantageous to the public service network if some other operator lifts part of the peak load. Certain services in certain towns carry a heavy economic penalty by having to make available at peak hours a much greater number of buses than are needed at other times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman. When I see Traffic Commission cases, I am sometimes amazed that the operators of services continue to object to new works services being provided which would relieve them of part of the peak load which is very often the major cause of their financial difficulties on the route as a whole. But for some reasons, operators in this country under the present traffic commissioners system seem to object to any new service on a conditioned reflex basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to comment on the reasons for appeals. I should have to look at individual cases before I could form any worthwhile judgment. Nevertheless, the judgment as to whether one should rely upon some new service, be it a works or other service, picking up part of the peak load must depend upon a whole series of carefully-balanced considerations. How long will the service be there? How much faith will the passengers have in its maintenance? If it is a works bus, does the firm have its holidays in the wakes weeks or at a time that is not traditional for that town? All those factors will have to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in saying that the problem of losing the fuel duty rebate can be resolved by applying for a road service licence, the Parliamentary Secretary may well have unwittingly created the anomaly for the next Transport Bill. I can well imagine some future Parliamentary Secretary telling us that it is clearly an anom-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2109</span>
aly that people should be able to qualify merely by obtaining road service licences for what are clearly not suitable means of providing for general transport and that the next Transport Bill should therefore leave it out. It would indeed be highly anomalous in some circumstances, including many of those described by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will restrict myself now to amendment No. 341. I am delighted to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say how much he favours local authorities using revenue support to ensure that public services are maintained where in their best judgment those services are required. I accept his criticism of our amendment in that we should have referred to revenue support provided through transport supplementary grant rather than simply to TSG support. However, I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary would not wish to resist the amendment on a quibble of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, the amount of revenue support from TSG to network or individual services varies enormously from one county area to another. In some cases it is a matter of political difference even between district councils and county councils. If he wishes to encourage the use of it, he should have a word with some of his right hon. Friends who framed the conditions of the last TSG arrangement. That arrangement offers an incentive to some of the countries which give least by way of revenue support to continue in that by giving them some assurance that if they do not match their total transport expenditure to the level of the datum line they will still qualify for certain advantages. I take it that the Parliamentary Secretary would not support that kind of policy in so far as it has adverse effects upon revenue support. I shall therefore count him as an ally when we reach that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the debate, but I do not quite follow what that was all about. In the transport supplementary grant settlement last year, in arriving at the figures for expenditure we accepted a very high level of revenue support in many parts of the country. Indeed, I believe that the level of revenue support for rural areas, for which clearly there is a need, is very generous. I therefore do not see what prob-
	<span class='label label-info column'>2110</span>
lems we are supposed to be creating in those areas, although I appreciate that costs in the transport business are rising, and some difficult choices had to be made as to priorities in rural areas. Nevertheless, our revenue support provision is still there. There is nothing in the transport supplementary grant arrangements to undermine that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to go too far into this matter, as I fear that I might stray out of order. I shall therefore, keep to the point which bears upon the amendment. The level of payment of transport supplementary grant—the 70 per cent. as opposed to the 60 per cent. of RSG—is determined in part by the extent to which the total transport expenditure of an authority exceeds a datum fixed by formula which I think is at least fair as between one country and another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the extent that total transport expenditure falls below the datum, those authorities would normally rule themselves out of most forms of transport supplementary grant. However, I believe that under the previous Government a decision was made to allow all revenue support to qualify for TSG, irrespective of whether it totted up to an amount exceeding the datum. I believe that under the present arrangements those whose total transport expenditure falls below the datum, are compensated in a way which did not previously take place. Therefore, it is a pity that there is now an incentive not to exceed the datum in terms of transport expenditure. However, we shall have to argue that in another forum, as it is not crucial to the present argument—to that extent, I wish that I had not raised it—that the Government should accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is the case, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, that there must be very few, if any, services that would not qualify, I see no possible harm in his accepting the amendment. If all those services which receive revenue support as a result of TSG will qualify for both bus grant and fuel duty rebate, the parliamentary Secretary should give an undertaking that he will accept that in any case. It is within the spirit upon which we are agreed. We shall not insist on our wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Parliamentary Secretary's point that the wording would be improved by referring to revenue support coming from TSG. If he will agree that that will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2111</span>
be acceptable at a later stage, we shall be happy to drop the point. But we certainly do not agree with him on the matter of the works buses. Indeed, in so far as we go along with his suggestion that there is something anomalous about it, we would rather see the anomaly corrected by making all works services eligible for the fuel</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 342, in page 46, line 20, leave out subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. It is intended to raise two main issues. One is the extent to which the new definition restricts the payment of bus grants, which was touched upon on the previous amendment, so I shall not make much of it now. In view of the current difficulties in developing and maintaining public transport, we regard it as highly regrettable that there should be any restriction upon the payment of bus grants. In so far as distinctions are made in present legislation as between one form of works service and another, we regard that as regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to tours and excursions, there is an even greater difficulty—the Parliamentary Secretary might call it an anomaly—in the new definition. Tours and excursions will now be subject to distance control. The stage carriage definition in the Bill embraces tours and excursions of less than 30 miles. Although they are caught within that new type of definition of stage carriage they will be specifically excluded by the clause from qualification for bus grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However the major point that I wish to probe is how "wholly or mainly" can be applied in practice. It seems to me that there is no way in which one could know with certainty at the time when somebody applied for a grant that the bus would be used in a particular matter in future. Let me put it another way. Would an operator be prepared to accept a restriction on how he could use a bus in the future as a condition of obtaining the new bus grant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2112</span>
	<p>rebate, in the hope that that would cut the cost to industry and would not result in increased fares to workers.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>Could he say that he would use the bus for a specific purpose, and thereby qualify for the grant, and afterwards when he wanted to use it for another purpose altogether sell the bus for which he had received the grant and buy another for a different purpose?</p>
	<p>It seems to me that the idea inherent in the wording of subsection (2) raises the most appalling problems of administration. I believe that it would be helpful for the Parliamentary Secretary to give an indication at this stage first of how he sees the initial scope of the grant being affected, and second how one can proceed on the basis of its being available for buses that are "wholly or mainly" in stage carriage operation.</p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The apparent effect of the amendment would be to prevent the new definition in subsection (1) concerning fuel duty rebate from applying to new bus grants. The effect of passing it would be to return to the present criteria on eligibility for new bus grant. I gather that the right hon. Gentleman that he is probing, because it would be undesirable to have a different definition of eligibility for new bus grant from that which prevails on fuel duty rebate. In practice, it would be particularly absurd to continue in this Bill with present definitions concerning new bus grant under existing law, when that will be supplanted on every other aspect of passenger transport legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that if one views grant as a sort of aid to capital investment in the bus industry as a whole, the Bill and any amendments to it will have no effect on its availability. As I have said, the

grant is subject to a cash limit now. The Bill is concerned to determine to precisely which services the present grant will be devoted. It can neither increase nor reduce the total amount of grant that will go to the passenger transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of subsection (2) will be that the new bus grant will be available for a bus that is "wholly or mainly" used as a stage carriage available to the general public—that is, not for an excursion or tour—and which does not make journeys of which the minimum distance is 30 miles for any passenger. We are aiming at local stopping services, and that will be the effect of our wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been asked how the words "wholly or mainly" will be interpreted. As is plainly on the face of the Bill, the phrase is used in present legislation. We are substituting the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or mainly as a stage carriage"</p></blockquote>
with the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or mainly in the operation of bus services".</p></blockquote>
That is there for technical reasons, so as to link with the definition of "bus service" in subsection (1). New bus grant will continue to be available where a bus is being used for more than 50 per cent. of the time in a stage carriage service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In theory, various problems, such as that posed by the right hon. Gentleman, could arise. When the new bus comes out of the works and is being delivered to the operator, how does one know that he will use it as he claims that he will when he applies for the grant? In practice that problem has never posed great difficulties in the operation of the grant to date. Those things are followed up. It is possible to discover whether a bus has been used as stipulated for over 50 per cent. of the time. There are arrangements for the repayment of the grant in cases—they are invariably accidental—where an operator cannot demonstrate that he has used the bus as stipulated for more than 50 per cent. of the time. The grant is repayable in those circumstances. The administrative arrangements have so far been able to cope with that aspect of new bus grant. I cannot see how the change of definition here will sufficiently alter the type of bus in respect of which grants are made to increase the administrative problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "wholly or mainly" will continue to apply exactly as it is applied now under the Transport Act 1968. Its mean-
	<span class='label label-info column'>2114</span>
ing is familiar both to bus operators and to those who administer the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a few points that I should otherwise have to make on clause stand part. I wish to speak with particular reference to bus grants. I should explain that I have a constituency interest. Metro Cammell Weyman, one of the most successful bus manufacturers in this country, has its factories and offices in my constituency. Against a background of declining manufacturing industry in the country as a whole, and particularly in the West Midlands, the company has been expanding in recent years. Therefore I am especially interested in bus grants and the way in which they have operated over the last few years. I am concerned about the possible consequences of subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two comments on what the Parliamentary Secretary said. First, I do not understand him when he says that it is clearly wrong—he used a more emotive expression—to have different definitions of the qualifications for fuel rebates and bus grants. I cannot see why that would be wrong. Surely the purposes of the two are totally different. It seems to me quite reasonable to have to satisfy different criteria in order to qualify for them. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary was simply making a debating point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, he referred to the importance of cash limits. I accept that that is how bus grants operate now. But the Parliamentary Secretary must not run away with the idea that because we have cash limits we cannot change the criteria for eligibility for bus grants. There is no blocking mechanism. Cash limits do not stop decisions about who can qualify for grants. They decide how much can be spent on any particular programme. To say that because we have a cash limit we shall not change or amend in any way the criteria by which bus operators qualify for new bus grants is to elevate cash limits to the point of idolatry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to press the Parliamentary Secretary to be a little more specific. I accept that the changes being made in the definition may not have a great impact on the numbers of buses and bus services involved in qualification for bus grants. However, will he be a little more specific and say what estimates he has made of the impact? He must know whether more or fewer bus services will qualify for bus

grants even within the much vaunted cash limits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely clear even now about how subsection (2) operates. As I read it, it operates by amending the Transport Act 1968. It is clear that subsection (2) (	<i>a</i>) does that. It substitutes the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or mainly as a stage carriage"</p></blockquote>
with
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or mainly in the operation of bus services".</p></blockquote>
That much is clear. That is a change made in the provision of the 1968 Act which governs new bus grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) than states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in subsection (2), after paragraph (	<i>c</i>) there shall be inserted"—</p></blockquote>
I have been reading that as a reference to section 32(2)(	<i>c</i>) of the Transport Act 1968. If so, I take it that the reference to bus services that we are putting into subsection (1) of the Act is "bus service" as defined in clause 51(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Parliamentary Secretary's nod as an indication that my reasoning is right so far. Therefore, the change that is brought about in this Bill in the meaning of stage carriage service directly bears on the provision of the bus grants. Therefore, the much narrower meaning of stage carriage service which applies in the Bill limits the provision of the new bus grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previously, the stage carriage service definition was much wider. In fact, as was agreed subject to the 21p minimum limit, buses could be running for enormous distances. Road service licensing provisions still applied. We did not have the category of express services which is created by the Bill. Therefore, I assume that the category of "express service" does not qualify for the new bus grant. Consequently, if an operator buys a bus which is to be used wholly or mainly for express services, he is buying a bus which does not qualify for the grant. If that is right, surely this is a considerable narrowing of entitlement to grant. Many of the buses made by the factory referred to by my hon. Friend which will be used—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend should take into account that the previous limit of a 21p fare meant that most of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2116</span>
services which will be categorised as "express services" would not have been classed as "wholly or mainly" for stage carriage and, therefore, would not have qualified for bus grants anyway. In effect, the Government are replacing the criterion of 21p with a mileage criterion of 30 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point. I also accept that the road service licence requirement does not necessarily govern the qualification in this case. Prior to clause 1, the road service requirements bit on the express service was in any case subject to the whole of the proceedings of present law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument is that once that definition is changed, the eligibility for the new grant is changed. If it is the case now that these buses will be brought within eligibility, or put outside it, on the basis of the new definition of "express service",—namely, whether or not a passenger is put down before he has travelled more than 30 miles from the point at which he boards the bus—that is a determining factor which changes as a direct result of clause 51(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give us his Department's estimate of the proportion of buses which will cease to be eligible on this definition as opposed to the old 21p minimum fare definition. It must have a bearing and must have that very direct effect on entitlement to the new bus grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with the more technical point raised by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and then go on to new bus grant generally and the effect on Metro Cammell Weyman. I can deal with the drafting point quite easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede that it is somewhat convoluted that for new bus grant one finds that the two changes that are made bear on section 32 (2) (	<i>b</i>) of the Transport Act 1968. A new bus service is substituted. "Bus service" has the same meaning as in section 92 of the Finance Act 1965. Section 92 will be as amended by clause 51(1) of the Transport Bill. In subsection (1), where the definition is changed it is the same bus service, so back one goes to what we are really after—namely, the stage carriage available to the public. As to the question whether we are narrowing it, without reopening the argument on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2117</span>
clause 3, the definition of stage carriage in the Bill seems much wider that the existing definition of stage carriage because we are moving from 30 miles to 21 pence, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis) said. These long-ranging tours, excursions and other services were not operating up to a distance of 30 miles at fares of under 21p. If we went only to stage carriage, as the bill defines, we would vastly extend the number of buses that would qualify for bus grant because we would bring in a lot of excursions and tours which did not go more than 30 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, subsection (1) of the clause still seeks to exclude excursions and tours. In order to help the Committee —this is a drafting point but I know that the right hon. Gentleman is interested in these matters—may I say that the definition of "excursion or tour" in subsection (1) is not satisfactory. We shall have to change it later, because we are referring to the 1968 Act, and if anyone can understand the definition of "excursion or tour" in the Act, he is a better man than I. It is not useful for present purposes, anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the shape of the clause, and how it works. It would not have the effect of confining overall the number of vehicles eligible for grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the points of substance raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford. I accept that Metro Cammell Weyman, in his constituency, has a considerable interest in new bus grant. In recent years it has had the intended effect of stimulating the rapid introduction of one-man buses and has produced a rather modern, more comfortable passenger fleet. New bus grant has been of considerable significance to manufacturers because the specifications for new bus grant have affected vehicle design and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I mentioned cash limits I did not do so as an argument that affected the definition. I was pointing out that, in practice, new bus grant is subject to a cash limit. It is not a cash limit imposed by the Government. A cash limit applied for some years under the previous Government. I was merely pointing up, for the benefit of firms such as Metro Cammell Weyman, which have an interest in the amount of grant available, that our bill is not affecting the amount of expenditure one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, it is running at £65 million.
	<span class='label label-info column'>2118</span>
It will be phased out, of course, but that has been the cash limit in recent years. We are merely determining which vehicles will get the benefit of that expenditure. There is no question of our narrowing the definition of eligible vehicles in the way the right hon. Gentleman thought we might, in order to reduce so much the number of qualifying vehicles that we might underspend in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not anticipate any underspend here and we expect the new bus grant to be pushing up against the cash limit for the remaining years of its existence, although we can never predict with certainty, because it depends on demands on operators, and who comes forward with claims on it. The purpose is not in any way to try to save money on new bus grant by going for a restrictive definition that would save us having to disburse up to our cash limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis) was worried about my argument that we should continue to have the same definition for new bus grant that we have for fuel duty rebate. One is not wedded to that idea merely for the sake of tidiness. In practice, fuel duty rebate and the new bus grant have been given for years to precisely the same services and the same vehicles. No one has ever objected to that or claimed that that was an artificial coincidence. For the reasons that I gave in the previous debate, both are aimed at the same sort of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of new bus grant was to be bringing modern buses which happened to be of a more comfortable design and were also able to be operated on a one-man basis and therefore more efficiently and at lower cost on local stopping services. That is the kind of stage carriage service available to the general public that we have defined in clause 51(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I can satisfy the hon. Member that, although the bus grant will be phased out as already announced, it will remain available to the same sort of vehicles to which it applies now, particularly for the local stopping services where one-man buses are still being introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When deciding what to do about new bus grant, the Government were tempted to cut it off, as it was a potential saving of public money. We expressly decided not to do so but to continue to phase it out until its work was completed, because we realised that the sudden cutting-off of £65 million worth of capital grants each year
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2119</span>
could have a catastrophic effect on the bus manufacturing industry as well as the passenger service operators. We continue to bear in mind the interests of the bus manufacturers because we believe not only in sales in this country, but in export markets. In that area there should be considerable scope for British industry, and we are conscious of the needs of Metro Cammell Weyman and others, and we shall try to make sure, in our public expenditure decisions and in our decisions on bus operation, specifications and so on, that we do not accidentally take measures which damage the bus industry's potential, either here or overseas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to spend any time reiterating the details that have come up in the debate so far. I want to address some remarks to the consequences of the clause, as it concerns commuter costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first day after the grand announcement that the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to investigate commuter costs on the railway. That is coincidental with the by-election which takes place on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter of commuter costs is a very important political matter. We must wait and see whether the Monopolies and Mergers Commission discovers anything new. I doubt that it will. The investigation may well boomerang on the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with how the clause will affect commuter costs. We are dealing with two areas of grants which have been a substantial part of the cost structure and revenue earning capacity of the bus companies. Some interesting arguments have been deployed by the Parliamentary Secretary in testing some of my right hon. Friend's arguments. We heard much about anomalies, and how they would be adjusted by the Bill. My right hon. Friend pointed out that some curious ways were being adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by the principle to which the Parliamentary Secretary appears wedded—namely, to level down, and not to level up. It would be interesting if this principle were applied consistently to all policies—education readily comes to
	<span class='label label-info column'>2120</span>
mind. There the argument is that everyone should go up to a given standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning bus grants, the Parliamentary Secretary said, rightly, that they were originally designed to assist the introduction of the "OMO" principle—the one-man operated bus principle—and presumably when that had been completed, the grant would be removed. That reminds me of the argument for the introduction of tax at the time of the Napoleonic wars—that taxes were for only one particular purpose, and once the wars had finished, the tax would be removed. An ingenious lawyer could argue that the argument about butter and lamb between ourselves and France is an extension of those wars, that is a major argument about tax and the redistribution of income, but I shall not follow that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another argument made by the Parliamentary Secretary was that of peak loading. He had a reasonable point, though I cannot agree with the implication that the problem for many of our transportation systems is that of dealing with peak loads, the capacity required for that being so much greater than that required to meet the requirement at other times. The Parliamentary Secretary said that he thought it was an anomaly that it was usually the bus operators who contest applications by works buses in the areas in which they are in competition. He argued that by using surplus capacity from the private sector, one would be able to reduce the difference between the demand at peak load time and that at off-peak time. That can only mean that the public sector would have an optimum loan which would be much lower than at present. We cannot accept a reduced public sector, quite apart from the effect on the spreading of cost structure which depends greatly on the number of units that the companies operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to pursue that argument, except to say that the implication is clearly a smaller public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary said that expenditure on bus grants at present is approximately £65 million. He duly recognised that to withdraw that immediately from the industry would have considerable effects. I think that we should all agree with that. We may, however, disagree about the effects of withdrawing it slowly. In any case, extra income will have to be raised by fares, or presumably by an increase in the TSG or RSG.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received a letter from the South
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2121</span>
Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive which highlighted some aspects of the bus grant problem. I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Until August 1980 Bus Grant will be at 50%, 1981 40%, 1982 30%, 1983 20%, 1984 10% and its cessation. Whereas we were informed that the amount of cash held by Central Government for Bus Grant would be transferred into the general Rates Support Grant allocation, no such assurance has been forthcoming from the Conservative Government."</p></blockquote>
Part of the Parliamentary Secretary's argument has been that both Governments have argued that bus grants will go out. One distinction between the two— certainly in the understanding of the bus operators, since there is no legislation to which one can point—is that the bus grant that would be denied to operators would be transferred to the revenue support for transport. That is a logical argument, but it depends on whether the Government are prepared to put that amount of money into the transport sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transport companies, viewing what will happen according to the Government's statement on bus grants, now face the probability of a considerable increase of their costs directly through this. I do not think that we can under-estimate the consequences. Some companies may order as many as 25 buses a year. I am told that the approximate price of a bus is £50,000. So the grant in this case on £1 million capital expenditure on buses is equal to £500,000 a year. That is an awful lot of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The burden of my point is that there will be an increasing cost which the bus company and ultimately the consumer will have to bear. There will be an explosion in transport costs in the year or so ofter the enactment of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Ministry given further thought to the consequences of abolishing bus grants? I understand that most companies operate leasing arrangements. While the Ministry and even the Treasury may not appreciate it, leasing arrangements are an important aspect of bus purchase for many companies. They are able by a leasing arrangement to spread the cost over a period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fear in the industry that such arrangements might be treated as a capital expenditure and would be subject to much more control. I agree that it would be in line with the Government's attitude at
	<span class='label label-info column'>2122</span>
present on the control of public and local authority expenditure, but if they were to do that as well as abolishing the bus grant there would be considerable problems not only of raising capital over a short period, which creates extra penalties and direct costs on operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke to the Hull corporation bus company, which has 246 buses, and a revenue of £4 million a year. It replaces about 15 buses a year, which means a capital charge of approximately £750,000, of which the subsidy is about £375,000. Therefore, the bus grant on which it depends for part of its income to cover operating expenditure is roughly £375,000, and it would have to plan for the abolition of that sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the second point concerning bus fuel rebate. It is interesting to examine what has happened. Labour and Conservative Governments have agreed that assistance will be given to public transport stage carriage systems. We should take note of what has happened over a period. In 1969, which was only 11 years ago, the amount of rebate was 22.5p on a fuel cost of 30p per gallon. Therefore the subsidy received was 75 per cent. of fuel cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To go to the other extreme, in February 1980 on a fuel cost of £1.06 a gallon the rebate was 42p. The proportion covered by the subsidy was less than 40 per cent. That is a considerable change over the period. To be a little more definitive about the matter, one can begin to see the difference in attitude between the two parties about support for bus services. With the shortage of oil and the energy crisis, and the argument from British Rail and the bus companies, the Government should do as the American Government did and state that the transport industry will get priority in the allocation of energy resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one examines the increase in the amount of the rebate over the relevant period one finds that in 1977 under the Labour Government the proportion had declined to 44 per cent. and they increased it from 22.5p to 35p a gallon, thus making it approximately a 50 per cent. subsidy and reversing the decline. The Government may now feel that they will increase the subsidy. If they do not do that—it would be in line with the Government's attitude to support for public expenditure in a difficult economic climate—it is unlikely that there will be an increase in fuel rebate. We can only hope that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1153">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2123</span>
will be one. At present the percentage is the lowest that it has ever been at 39.74.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bus companies will have to find more money to maintain their present level of bus orders and to maintain services. At the same time, the Bill will make it easier for private operators to compete with them, albeit in stage areas under commissioner control to a certain extent. The companies' costs will explode because there is also the reduction in working hours under the EEC arrangements and the inflation rate—and oil price rise percentages tend to be greater than that. The two components of the clause will be simply a contributory factor. There would seem to be nothing but gloom, higher costs and reduced services for the transport system of the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) began by talking about the effect on commuter costs of the changes that are proposed in the clause. But we are not making any such changes. We are dealing with those services that are eligible for the new bus grant and fuel duty rebate. The average commuter uses a stage carriage service which stops on its way to the city centre. That bus is exactly the sort of vehicle that falls within the definition about which we are talking. There is no question of the sort of stage carriages services that are laid on for commuters and everybody else being taken out of fuel duty rebate or new bus grant under the present clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then, fairly, went on to enlarge the issue and discuss the exact role of the new bus grant and fuel duty rebate. Let me clarify the position on the new bus grant. When it was instituted as a result of the 1967 White Paper, it was intended to be a temporary grant to allow a once-for-all modernisation of the bus fleet and particularly to speed up the introduction of one-man operated buses. That was the policy of the then Labour Government. It has subsequently been confirmed, and the tapering-off of the new bus grant arises from the 1977 White Paper, on transport issued by the Labour Government. They announced that there would be a tapering-off of the grant by 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, at present the Government are looking anxiously for all sorts of savings in public expenditure. Transport
	<span class='label label-info column'>2124</span>
has to take its share of them. We have been examining where economies can be made and needless expenditure avoided in the interest of the national economy. We had to consider whether continuing to phase out new bus grants until 1985 was justified. Had we cut out the grant now, we would have saved £65 million in the first year alone. But we did not do so. For the reasons that I gave to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Stetchford (Mr. Davis), we decided that making such a cut-off so suddenly would have a dramatic effect on passenger transport operators who have been planning fleet replacement on the basis that the new bus grant would continue for a few more years, and that it would have a very damaging short-term effect on bus manufacturers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have altered the timetable by only one year and will phase out the grant by 1984. The policy is that this is a temporary grant to be phased out. That was contemplated by the Labour Government in 1967, pursued by the Labour Government in 1977 and is being carried to a conclusion by this Government. It would be wrong to change at this late stage and go for a permanent capital subsidy. That would have a distorting effect on the investment pattern and the financial decisions of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the replacement of its major capital asset—its bus fleet—qualified for a 50 per cent. grant from the Government, the industry would be diverting resources into new bus fleets all the time instead of to other investments. That would also apply with the permanent situation whereby the capital investment of the industry and the replacement of its fleet was somehow divorced from its running costs and from the need to consider capital replacement when fixing fare levels, levels of other subsidy, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We prefer the system of revenue support by local authorities directed to identified desirable services, which cannot be financed, to cover their running costs and capital replacement solely out of the fare box. Therefore, we invite county councils to decide which part of the transport services in their locality are deserving of a subsidy. We believe that that is a much more sensible way of applying a subsidy than the rigid new bus grant, which has fulfilled its main purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no change in policy on fuel duty rebate. The hon. Gentleman has made ingenious use of figures for over the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2125</span>
years showing what proportion of total fuel costs the fuel duty rebate has represented. The main determining factor in all that has been the level of the duty. During recent years, the price of fuel has been rising rapidly, but the tax has not always kept pace. Where the overall price of fuel has risen and the tax has become a smaller proportion of the cost of the fuel, the rebate, which runs at 100 per cent. of the fuel duty as regards passenger vehicles, has become a smaller proportion of operating costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a stage—I cannot remember off-the-cuff when it was—when the rate of rebate was increased to 100 per cent. It has been at 100 per cent. for some years, and if it is in decline as a proportion of fuel costs that is because the level of tax for all users is not keeping pace with the increased price of fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an easy way for the Government to correct the position, and that is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Budget in three weeks' time to whack-up the duty. When the duty is increased by a considerable amount, the value of the rebate to public service operators who get a 100 per cent. rebate will be considerable compared with other operators whose fuel costs will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the hon. Gentleman has made artificial use of the figures. He is not charting a different level of concern for public transport by various Governments but charting the comparison between the overall price of fuel and the amount of duty in the cost to other road users other than passenger transport operators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is inevitable, because of the rapidly escalating price of crude oil on the international oil market and the need for Governments to save energy, conserve oil supplies and look at possible fiscal ways of doing so, that the cost of fuel for all kinds of transport will rise steeply in the next few years. That in itself carries a considerable advantage to the public passenger transport industry, including the railways. The cost of running a private motor car will rise steeply one way or another over the next few years. The comparative costs of passenger transport should be much more attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will continue the process of fuel duty rebate, so there will be a continuing subsidy—if it can be called a subsidy —towards the passenger transport industry. The overall effect of oil prices and fuel price changes should be to give an
	<span class='label label-info column'>2126</span>
added competitive advantage in the next few years to the public passenger transport services as opposed to private motor cars. We hope to give in the Bill as a whole the best opportunities to take advantage of that improved competitive position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The basic point—also made by Hull corporation—is that, because of inflation and the increase in oil prices the amount of the rebate is actually reducing. The difference was measured between 1978 and 1979 and amounted many thousands of pounds. It is having to find more money because it is receiving less subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will reconsider that also. But my understanding is that it will be reducing as a proportion of fuel costs, and the many thousands of pounds being talked about are presumably the increased fuel costs that it is having to pay. The level of duty has not gone up as fast as fuel costs for all users, so although passenger transport operators should get 100 per cent. rebate of all the duty, the value of that rebate is declining as a proportion of fuel costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer were to put up fuel duty in the forthcoming Budget, the value of the rebate to public passenger transport operators as a proportion of their fuel costs could go up again. They would simply not have to pay an increased cost which other uses of the same fuels would have to pay. It will be realised on reflection that the proportion is simply the relation between the tax and the price of the fuel over the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic point is that the competitive position of passenger transport is likely to be improved. We are continuing revenue support to selective services and encouraging the sensible use of it by counties. We are continuing fuel duty rebate, and if the tax on fuel duty has to go up at any stage public passenger transport operators will be exempt from those increases in duty. The overall position is not one of declining support for passenger transport.

I hope that instead it will be one of new opportunity with a sensible use of public subsidy where there will be value for money. The new bus grant will not fit into that indefinitely, and now that it has fulfilled its purpose it would be sensible to phase it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has twice during our debates referred to his, and presumably the Government's, support for the use of revenue support for selected services. He appears to be making a distinction between the element of TSG that goes into revenue support for individual services that could not be operated without it, and the more general practice of giving the revenue support on a network arrangement. I do not necessarily dissent from his proposition provided he is prepared to follow it through to its logical consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposition of the Government being specific in their encouragement of revenue support for those individual services which could not exist without it, would simply be that those who at present are prepared to make network agreements with local authorities may say, "We do not want to make network agreements any more. We have a Government at Westminster who favour the idea of the revenue support that comes from TSG going to individual loss-making services. Clearly that would lift from them what is now the enormous burden of cross-subsidising a whole range of services which is only in small part met from revenue support".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that what the Parliamentary Secretary says would fit completely logically with the philosophy of competition and having a much easier licensing regime and letting people come in and compete on profitable services. But I put it to him that the logical corollary of what he said is that those who operate on network agreements now will say "We do not want to network any longer on this basis. We want specific support for our loss-making services and to be completely free to compete on those that do not make a loss. That is an advantage to the public."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that in the more competitive framework operating within profitable service routes, fares could even be brought down. But the public would have to pick up the tab by way of revenue support for an enormous amount of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2128</span>
operating costs of loss-making services which they do not now bear in that way. The Parliamentary Secretary is saying that if there is a reponse to what the Government are trying to encourage, there will have to be a massive increase in public expenditure and revenue support because that will carry all the losses on loss-making routes instead of their being carried on a cross-subsidy basis by profitable routes as happens now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can make clear our position on revenue support. I have spoken in favour of it and will continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government give transport supplementary grant to each county. Transport supplementary grant is specific to transport but otherwise it is a block grant. It is not divided up for specific projects or specific areas of expenditure. In the end, we arrive at a total sum as the grant to a county for its transport expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In making their bids for grant, local authorities indicate their likely level of expenditure on revenue support, road maintenance and new road building—to take the broad categories, in the last settlement, the Government's policy when awarding the grant was to give one sum and tell local authorities that they could divide it up and spend it as they wished. In order to help them to know how we arrive at the total figure for each authority—we have to tell them that we accept expenditure of a given level—we broke up the accepted expenditure into so much for revenue support, so much for road maintenance and so much for new road building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the last Government, who tried to give a much closer steer—to use a polite word, because sometimes they bullied local authorities into spending money on specific interns which the Government thought right and the authorities did not—we have gone out of our way to tell local authorities that although we have arrived at the total figure this way, it is their responsibility to choose local priorities. And if the resulting pattern of expenditure does not match our breakdown between revenue support, new road building and road maintenance, that is their responsibility not ours, that money is our grant towards transport expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within that, local authorities decide what they will do by way of revenue sup-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2129</span>
port. It is their policy on revenue support that matters. They can choose whether to give revenue support on a network basis, although, as I indicated earlier, a sensible use of revenue support is to support desirable services. That seems to be the underlying philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am critical of some areas where a monopoly operator under the present licensing regime appears to come along each year and is able to demand ever-mounting losses for his system which he expects the authority to pay. The authority blandly comes to the Government and expects them to give a grant to cover road losses. There is no real direction of public support towards specific, identified services. But it is for the local authorities to decide how to use their revenue support, and we will not interfere too closely in how they do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In determining figures for accepted expenditure, clearly we have to decide what a county is likely to need to support its passenger transport services. Within the present difficult financial climate we have done our best to assist those counties, especially in rural areas where there is a problem in maintaining an adequate level of rural services without some degree of revenue support. With recent TSG bids we tried to do our best for the shire counties, especially to help support their rural services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely that the level of costs of passenger transport is rising so rapidly in some areas that it will be a job to keep abreast of the demand. I suggest, however, that that is all the more reason for making use of such revenue support as is available in the most sensible way, directing that support towards desirable services and ensuring that it goes to those services which would otherwise vanish and that those which should be competitive and pay for themselves are made to do so. I therefore hope that counties will do their best to ensure that revenue support is not used simply to cover losses made by inefficient operators, as they seem to have been doing in one or two cases. I have to look at special needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter that arises is the question of trial areas, where again it is part of the government's policy that revenue support is required. We believe that trial areas offer great potential for many rural areas, where the present licensing system places an unfair restriction upon the range of services and the new services that can
	<span class='label label-info column'>2130</span>
be provided. If a county opts to be a trial area, we foresee that in taking a fresh look, as transport authorities will now be able to do, at the transport needs of what may be a large rural area, and in deciding what new operators can be attracted to the area and what new types of service can be provided, the authority may find a substantial need for revenue support, certainly in the early days in order to get things going. If a county decides to designate the whole or part of the county as a trial area, as we certainly hope at least two or three will, I shall certainly not be surprised if the authority then comes along with a transport supplementary grant bid, saying that it needs a fair level of revenue in order to get the scheme under way without danger to the transport network in the area. We shall look sympathetically upon requests of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsidised competition again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an illustration of how sensible use of revenue support is entirely compatible with the Government's passenger transport policy. We are not blind to the fact that certain services need subsidy. We do not think that subsidy is applied in the most sensible way in some areas at present, least of all in South Yorkshire of which the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) is so fond, where the passenger transport policy seems to me to be quite barmy and a huge and needless expense to the local ratepayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do no wish to pursue this matter much further this morning, as some of this goes wider than our argument on the clause. But the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks cannot be allowed to pass without comment. He is saying that it is the policy of his Government to require every county transport authority in this country to put up to them for approval,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2131</span>
qualifying element by element, a calculation as to the basis upon which it should be paid TSG, so much for roads, so much for maintenance and so much for revenue support. The authorities will seek to agree those sums with the Government and the Government will retain the right to agree which are the qualifying elements. But as soon as the sum is fixed, they will wash their hands of it. They will say to the authority, "The priorities are now entirely up to you; use the money in any way you like". That is no responsible way to run a transport policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government believe, as a matter of national policy, that they should encourage revenue support, they should have the courage to say so, and they should argue with those authorities as to what are appropriate levels. I do not object to the Parliamentary Secretary say-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 126.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are drafting amendments of minuscule importance or controversy. The clause amends the definition of an articulated vehicle. We missed one piece of legislation in which that definition occurred. It is clearly right that the definition in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967 should be in the same terms as the one in the 1972 Act. We therefore seek to</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2132</span>
	<p>ing that the Labour Government leaned on authorities about what they thought was the right level. They thought that some authorities, notably Yorkshire, were spending too much, and others, such as Cambridgeshire, too little. But at least they took a clear responsibility for approving elements within the total calculation of transport support grants. The Government intend to run away from that responsibility. Having approved the grants, they will tell the county authorities that they can spend the money as they like within the total amount, and that they can carry the responsibility for that at county level.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 6.</p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the definition of articulated vehicles in section 191 of the 1972 Act. As I understand it, the problem for those wanting to operate articulated vehicles has not been that they could not obtain approval from the Ministry in the appropriate form to run the vehicle, but that they have not been able to charge fares. This matter arises today because primary legislation is required to enable fares to be charged on vehicles which are approved as safe and properly constructed by another legislative process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise briefly the question of whether we should remove from our law the need for primary legislation in order to charge fares, given that there is a suitable process for approval of vehicles as safe to go on the road. I have not given the Parliamentary Secretary notice of this question, so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2133</span>
I do not necessarily expect a detailed answer at this stage. But it would be useful, before we complete our proceedings on the Bill, to have an assurance that the Ministry has looked at existing legislation controlling the right to charge fares on vehicles so that if there is a possibility of other types of vehicle falling within this category, provided that they are subject to the necessary safeguards and the Ministry checking that they are safe to be on the roads, requirement for primary legislation in order to charge might be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will consider that further point. I take the drift of the question to be whether we might take this opportunity to open the way for other experimental vehicles to come into the fare-paying public passenger transport system, in the way in which the clause now allows for articulated buses. My immediate response is to say that I am not aware of any other kind of experimental vehicle and that we have dealt here with the only one that at present is a contender. But it may well be that there is no point in having to come back every time someone comes up with a new form of vehicle. We are always anxious to look for advances in vehicle technology and novel forms of passenger transport. I will consider the right hon. Gentleman's point and either table an amendment, if that seems desirable, or send him a letter explaining how the matter will be dealt with if we feel that it can be adequately covered by the present legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman is quite right that clause 52 is concerned to enable articulated vehicles, popularly known as "bendy-buses" in this country, to appear on British roads on a scale which at present they do not.' There is nothing illegal about running such a bus on the roads at present. The anomaly—if I may so describe it—is that fares cannot be charged. It will come as no surprise to any follower of public transport affairs that the only authority using large vehicles on which they do not charge anyone a penny is South Yorkshire. There they apparently do not believe in charging anyone anything for anything. A few moments ago I described their passenger transport policy as barmy. Now that we are giving the freedom to charge fares on "bendy-buses", it will be interesting to see whether South Yorkshire will begin to do
	<span class='label label-info column'>2134</span>
so. If it follows the slightly crackpot policies of recent months I shall be surprised if it does. However, other more sensible passenger transport authorities will be able to do so. Probably most of us have experience of such vehicles abroad. I have certainly travelled in them in European countries. They are a valuable acquisition to some passenger transport fleets. They are an alternative to our double-deckers. There are routes where double-deckers cannot be operated satisfactorily, because of low bridges and so on. I am sure that quite a number of bus operators will look to see whether "bendy-buses" are more suitable for them. The clause will give them power to charge sensible fares for the services thus provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has exactly grasped the point. As our legislation contains a means of sanctioning the use of new types of vehicle proved to be safe, the Opposition are concerned to ensure that there is in the law at large a means of charging fares on them once they are sanctioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I object to the way in which the Parliamentary Secretary refers to South Yorkshire's transport policy. It is very much to the councillors' credit that they were prepared to put to a democratic local electoral test an entirely different fares policy, have had it approved by the electorate, and that they are prepared to experiment with other vehicles. If they choose not to use the powers provided, if they see their system as an advance towards having public transport collectively rather than individually financed, that is their democratic right. I do not wish to have an argument on the subject now, however, I hope that we are agreed on the main issue. If legislation contains the means of sanctioning new types of vehicle once they are proved to be safe, we should have a similar process enabling fares to be charged when the vehicles are introduced into public service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be reasonably brief. I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary for some clarification. The traffic commissioners have at present the authority to look into fares. I understand that the intention of the clause is to remove that condition. I am concerned about how that will affect the Tyne and Wear Metro, which is in my constituency. At present the local authority has the last word. Is it the intention that the clause will affect the system for charging fares on the Metro?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the clause is to bring the Blackpool tram system and the Tyne and Wear Metro—which is governed by a private Act—in line with our proposals in clause 7 on fares control for bus services. There will not be a complete abolition of fares control. But it will be retained in a limited number of cases. We are relaxing the present system of strict control over fares. As we are getting rid of strict fares control for bus services we see no case for retaining fares control for the Blackpool trams and the Tyne and Wear Metro. The clause brings them in line with the other provisions and gets rid of the power of the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), says, both those systems are run by local authorities. In both cases, therefore, elected local authorities will have the deciding influence on the level of fares appropriate for the services. Nothing in the clause 53 will change the present powers of the local authority over the Tyne and Wear Metro. It merely makes clear that the traffic commissioners are not concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned that the effect of the clause may be somewhat wider than the Parliamentary Secretary has indicated. Clearly it repeals section 2 and schedule 1 of the Transport Charges &c. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1954. Those provisions relate, as the clause fairly points out, to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"independent tramways, trolley vehicles and railways of the nature of a tramway".</p></blockquote>
I suggest that that is capable of a wide interpretation. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) raised the Question of its effect on the Tyne and Wear Metro. Surely it must be arguable that a number of other vehicles could fall under that
	<span class='label label-info column'>2136</span>
definition. Some may already exist. Others may be brought into existence at some future time. They will be removed from commissioner control that was provided in the 1954 Act. That brings us to the question of what other controls would exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First let me cite a few examples that occur to me. It could be said that the cable lift railway at Scarborough, which goes up from the foreshore to wherever the Grand Hotel stands, is a vehicle
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the nature of a tramway".</p></blockquote>
It certainly has a body something like a tram; it certainly runs on rails as does a tram. It is a kind of tram or cable railway that goes up a steep slope. Would that be subject to control? I even wonder whether the railway that goes up Mount Snowdon is of a similar nature. When one looks at the cogs between the rails and at the way that it chugs up the mountain, one can see certain characteristics in common with the Scarborough cable tramway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the major difficulty that I see is one over which we argued when discussing clause 2. Once such operations are taken out of one form of fare control by the clause they may be liable to others. Whether that is so depends on whether public service vehicles are used. The definition of public service vehicles in clause 2 quite specifically excludes the vehicles under discussion. It actually contains the words "other than a tramcar". A public service vehicle, therefore, is a motor vehicle other than a tramcar that is used for carrying passengers. If the Government's intention here is that such vehicles should be taken out of the specific and particular form of commissioner control and opened up to the normal form of control over public service vehicles, the definition in the Bill is not appropriate for the purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I probably slightly misled the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee earlier. Those vehicles are being taken out of fare control altogether. At the moment they are subject to strict fare control under the 1954 Act, as was described. Let us look at the vehicles involved. We are talking about tramways. At the moment the only one is at Blackpool, but if any new ones were opened the provision would apply to them as well. We are talking also about trolleybuses, of which there are now none in this coun-

	<span class='label label-info column'>2137</span>
try—however, there might conceivably be some in the future. The last category is railways of the nature of tramways. That does indeed mean things like the Scarborough cliff railway, the one at Bridgnorth and cliff railways at various other places. Traffic commissioner control of fares is inappropriate in such cases. The enterprises are all run by public bodies. The measure is very simple. It takes them outside the scope of fares control altogether. I speak off the cuff—and I am prepared to corrected if I am wrong—but I am under the impression that the Snowdon
	<span class='label label-info column'>2138</span>
railway is a light railway. Light railways are governed by quite different legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
