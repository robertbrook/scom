DEFINITION OF "PUBLIC SERVICE VEHICLE"</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment No.</i> 36 <i>moved</i> [15 <i>January</i>],</p>
<p>in page 3, line 8, leave out "one or more" and insert "not more than five".</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is apparently designed, according to the Minister's statements on the Floor of the House and in Committee, to capture the potential of car sharing and, using the emotive phrase, set the motorist free.<br><br>
This is a major issue and we intend to spend a little time developing the argument on this principle. Indeed, the Minister has made clear that this is something for which he has always campaigned and it may well become known as the Fowler clause— probably becoming as infamous as the name Beeching in relation to the railway system.<br><br>
Therefore, we intend to deploy arguments that reflect not only the concern of the Opposition in this matter but, as we understand it, both in evidence given to the Department and correspondence that we have seen, of private hire car and taxi drivers.<br><br>
It is clear from our debates on subsections (1) and (2), taken with schedule 1, that the motorist sharing his car will now be able to accept payment from separate fare paying passengers travelling with him and his car will not be regarded as a public service vehicle. Therefore, all the normal conditions, controls and safeguards associated with a vehicle so defined will no longer apply. Indeed, subsection (1) further reduces the coverage of the definition of a public service vehicle.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to restrict the number of passengers who may travel in the car at any one time on one journey— namely, to delete "one or more" and insert "not more than five". That will change the figure of nine passengers— eight passengers and the driver—as the limit for a car involved in picking up passengers and charging a fee, to no more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
than five, which effectively will mean six— five passengers and the driver.<br><br>
I now deal with the numbers argument which began to develop at the end of our previous sitting. The Minister said that it was no major step to go from seven to eight. Indeed, we have proposed the figure of five, not the figure of seven contained in the Labour Government's legislation on car sharing. There are good reasons for that and I hope to bring out the difference between the approach of the Opposition to the car sharing principle, as reflected in the numbers proposed in the amendment, and that of the Government.<br><br>
It was said that the increase proposed in the Bill was no major leap. That may not appear to the Government to be a major leap for mankind, but we know that legislation often determines the design of cars, in some cases directly and in others indirectly. Legislation on the number of car seats is another example of where the design of cars can be affected.<br><br>
I am more conversant with the shipping industry—where a similar problem has developed with legislation, leading to what is known in that industry as the "paragraph" ships. These ships are designed to avoid being covered by a subsection in a specific piece of legislation. Cars are not necessarily free from that either, although they may not necessarily be known as "paragraph" cars.<br><br>
An obvious example was vans that were converted to shooting brakes simply by having windows put in their sides. That meant that less tax was paid by the purchaser, although eventually legislation was brought in to change the practice. That is only one example, and most of us know of others.<br><br>
I suggested at our last sitting that although an increase of one seat was not a major step, it was sufficient to cause another Government Department—the Home Office—to resist the demand of the taxi trade to increase the carrying capacity of taxis from four to five. That was refused by the Home Office, presumably because it felt that it would reduce safety. However, I imagine that most of us in the House have broken the law when we have piled into a cab five at a time in New Palace Yard.<br><br>
The Minister rightly says that he wants to legalise existing practice. That was the previous Government's argument in respect of car sharing. However, the Government would carry more conviction if they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0140">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
could persuade the Home Office to grant what taxi drivers have been seeking and to allow them to carry five passengers, as is the present normal practice. If one more passenger makes little difference will he ask the Home Office to accede to the trade's request? I should like to hear why the Home Office has refused. I realise that it is not his Department, but the matter concerns transport. The whole area of transport provision is what we are talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not talking about the whole area of transport provision. Indeed, I have let the hon. Gentleman speak about taxis, in which passengers are not carried at separate fares. But we are discussing a very narrow point, namely, that in his amendment. I should be glad if the hon. Gentleman would not encourage the Minister to give an answer that would be out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Mr. English. I certainly wish to keep in order.</span></p>
<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport <span class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that, without notice, I do not think that I could answer such a question anyway. It is outside the responsibility of my Department. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman tables a question to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. Without making inquiries of the Home Office, I have no idea why the proposal was resisted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not so easily dismissed as that. I shall not encourage the Minister to answer, but I have copies of correspondence on the subject signed by him and sent to people in the taxi trade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I will not have this. Five, four, three, two or one people are carried in a taxi at a single fare, not at separate fares. We are discussing a clause which contains the wording:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section a journey made by a vehicle in the course of which one or more passengers are carried at separate fares."</p></blockquote>
Hackney carriages have nothing to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to keep within order, Mr. English. Of course I accept your point about taxis.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
As the Minister pointed out, in previous legislation which the Bill seeks to amend, the original limit of four passengers in a car was changed by the Labour Government to seven. However, by our amendment we seek to reduce that for a good reason. The principle involved here is clearly the attempt to use the larger cars to carry more passengers who presently travel into London in their own cars. The purpose of the clause is to encourage and to give greater financial incentive for those driving into London, for example, to adopt car-sharing arrangements. Various larger cars have been mentioned and there was some debate last time as to whether cars could be purchased which would take up to seven or eight people. However, five certainly seems a more realistic figure for normal carrying capacity at the present time. I note that the cars referred to as large in the 1978 debates were the Peugeot and the Ford Dorchester. I do not know whether industry has acted to produce larger cars since the limit was changed to seven. Immediate evidence suggests that they have not.<br><br>
The first major change in the limit of how many people should travel in a car, over and above the figure of four laid down in the 1960 legislation was when the previous Government allowed a car-sharing capacity of up to seven. But there are essential differences here. That limit of seven was considered to encourage social ownership of cars. We thought that people travelling to football matches or going to work could get together in some kind of social arrangement to share cars. The charges or amounts of money exchanged as a result of that could be agreed upon by those involved. We did not, however, allow it to go much further than that.<br><br>
The Minister's proposals, however, would allow considerably more advertising and indeed permit the situation to be free from any control by the local authorities or the commissioners. Those conditions were retained in the Labour Government's proposals because we believed that they would prevent any undermining of the principle of the public transport system. The lack of such conditions in the Bill is a major reason for our change from the previous Government's figure of seven to the present proposal for five.<br><br>
The Bill would widen the possibilities a great deal. It would allow uncontrolled advertising in a number of ways. Previously the local authority and the commissioners
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
put conditions on the nature of the advertising, but that will no longer be. People will now be able to advertise in the newsagent's, in the paper or wherever, and tout for business, for it almost amounts to that. One can tout for people to join one in one's car journey from A to B and the number permitted will be up to eight in any one car. Those are the conditions laid down by the Bill. The Labour Government made it clear that they were not concerned to allow people to develop this practice as a business, and limits were therefore imposed by their legislation. The present Government, however, seek to free people from those regulations so that the full potential of car-sharing can be developed.<br><br>
The Minister argued that the clause would achieve a reduction in congestion and a saving in energy. If eight people in separate cars transfer to one car, the obvious conclusion is that there will be seven fewer cars on the roads, which would clearly reduce congestion. In that case, the argument that eight in a car would effect a greater saving of congestion and of energy than would five in a car would seem to be a reasonably fair one. However, I do not know whether one can assume that that would be so.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The Minister has claimed that 130,000 cars come into London alone. He therefore concluded that a 10 per cent. reduction of that figure would be a major saving. However, we may encounter a difficulty that many bus companies have found. Increasing a bus fare by 1p does not necessarily mean that the resulting income is that amount multiplied by the number of journeys. The increase tends to be a deterrent to some people, so that the total return is less than was expected. I shall not develop that argument; the point is reasonably clear. The same could happen with cars. If the scheme works successfully, and road congestion is reduced, presumably people will be able to travel much more quickly from A to B by car. That may encourage more people to bring their cars on to the roads. Present experience in London shows that. That, however is not a major drawback.<br><br>
A more substantial objection is that people are much more likely to use cars that carry five passengers rather than eight. In order to take eight passengers it would be necessary to buy a bigger car.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
The present tendency is not to buy larger cars, but, if anything, the reverse, and for very good reasons. Larger cars cost much more, in running costs, in maintainance, and in interest payments for purchasing them. It seems likely that most people will retain cars with five or six seats, so that to allow eight to be carried will not make great savings. Therefore I do not think that there will be a great deal of difference in congestion whether the Bill specifies five or eight passengers.<br><br>
There seems no justification in leaving the figure at eight, unless it is desired that some people should buy larger cars. The Opposition are concerned about that prospect. To decide to buy a larger car is almost a commercial decision. It is not a decision—such as one would make to buy a normal car with four or five seats—to buy a car in which to do one's ordinary running around. A car to carry eight passengers, that is with an overall capacity of nine people, is a very large car. It would be reasonable to assume that people might make that decision to gain the financial incentives, albeit not profits, offered by the Bill. The figure of eight or nine may then encourage people to make a number of journeys between A and B. Someone whose advertising has shown that he could be taking thirty people might be encouraged to do three or four runs up to London on certain days.<br><br>
That may well be good for reducing congestion and saving energy, but it will encourage a business in that area. That is distinct from somebody travelling from A to B and at nine o'clock in the morning picking up four, or seven, of his mates and sharing the costs.<br><br>
Here is the relevance of the clause to professionals in the business. It will encourage the business practice of providing a regular service in direct competition with the professional providers of such a service, whom we control under other legislation. The imposition of the figure of eight in the clause places the professionals in a difficult position.<br><br>
The Minister can confirm that he has talked to the taxi people about this. They are concerned about the clause. The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall), who raised the matter on Second Reading, made clear his opinion that the provision for car sharing in clause 2 would create competition. No one objects to that, but its degree will be unknown. It is causing much concern to the licensed taxi trade.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
If the competition is of an unknown quantity, it is likely to be unfair, and the point about whether it is five or eight increases the unfairness of the competition. If the Government leave in eight—it effectively means eight, because "one or more" means up to eight—the difference between eight and five is an important competitive aspect when there is concern about people who will be able to provide a service in direct competition with the professional provision of cars or taxis.<br><br>
Whilst we agree that the charges, to which we shall come later in our debate, are not supposed to include an element of profit, they certainly include a charge towards the depreciation and wear and tear of the car, petrol and all aspects of having a car. So to that extent there will be a gain—a gain in the purchase of an asset which cannot be achieved under present regulations.<br><br>
Therefore, the definition of profit is much narrower in this sense. Many of our businesses tend to operate solely on cost and recovery of costs, and do not dare think about profit or return on assets. A business is still considered a commercial operation if it continues like that, albeit a limited one. Many businesses have continued in this way for some time.<br><br>
We are attempting in clause 2(3) to implement five seats. It is our contention that to all intents and purposes by leaving eight in the Bill we shall encourage the use of private cars for business, which will undermine the existing taxi and private car business, and the public transport system, which we particularly protected under previous legislation when we allowed the use of seven seats. How we might feel about unfair competition is a matter for debate, but what is clear is that the difference between five and eight could be important. If there are eight in a car the gain is considerably greater.<br><br>
I am mindful, Mr. English, of the restrictions you have imposed about discussing the principle involved for taxis, which we can perhaps develop more fully in the clause stand part debate. However, what is important is that if we are to allow an increase from five to eight—and it has been defined that having four seats in other cars makes them public vehicles in this sense, and that that is a safe carriage of passengers in a vehicle—there is no definition of safety in relation to the carriage of five to eight passengers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
If we say that there should be no more than four seats in a car used for business, why should we now consider allowing eight as a safe number? There is no definition of safety. There is an assumption that four or five in taxis is a figure based on safety considerations. Here it is assumed that five would be a safer figure than eight, provided that there is such a large car with eight passenger seats.<br><br>
Where is the restriction? What if I wanted to use a five-seater car and shove eight people into it? There may be legislation that provides that eight people must not ride in it. Under those circumstances, presumably the safety principle applies equally, or even more than if an eight-seater vehicle had eight people in it. There is no distinction between that and a five-seater vehicle being used for eight people. The Minister should tell us whether he is prepared to lay down a law— or indeed whether such a law exists— which prevents someone with a five-seater car from putting eight passengers into it.<br><br>
The Bill makes no mention of the quality of the driver. On clause stand part we shall want to point out all the conditions that we have laid on the taxi driver about his knowledge, medical certificates and everything else.<br><br>
The point about the competition aspect that the Minister will have to answer is that if a man can now have a car and carry up to eight people—and we are suggesting that the number should be five in order to point out the absurdities that may develop —he will be able to go to Heathrow, for example, under the proposed legislation, and offer to pick up eight people and carry them in his car and say that he is now car sharing. He is no longer plying for private hire; he is simply at Heathrow touting for business. He will advertise that he is going from Heathrow into London and that he will take eight people in his car. From what I can see, there is nothing to prevent his doing that.<br><br>
I know that the Minister believes that the enforcement agencies are able to prevent that, but we already know that with all the present laws and regulations there are difficulties for the police and other specialists in enforcing that legislation. But under the proposed legislation that driver will have further protection and be able to say "I am no longer plying for hire. I am in a car-sharing business going from Heathrow to London". The Minister may say that the charges will be less under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
this legislation, because that driver will not be able to charge more, and provided that the payment is made before he leaves Heathrow that driver will be in order. Having eight people in his car instead of five will mean a greater inducement for him. That is another reason why we believe the Bill is likely to become a touts' charter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that somehow we are changing the law and making it easy to ply for hire under cover. If there is a danger of people abusing the law in the way he described, that danger already exists, because the Bill does not change the law in any respect which is relevant to the points he made. The only changes in the law governing car sharing will be an increase of one in the number of people for which the vehicle is adapted and some relaxation of the advertising controls. Other than that, we are making no changes to the law. There is nothing in the Bill that will make it easier for anyone to claim that he is car sharing. As the hon. Gentleman said, the only change will be that the vehicle will be one seat bigger, which is the only reason why that rather fanciful argument can be deployed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a number of occasions Ministers have shown that they have not fully understood the Bill. If the Minister is informing the Committee that a list of charges will be provided in later amendments, that is a major change in the provision of a fare. That also changes what will be considered to be
<br><blockquote><p>"in the course of a business."</p></blockquote>
Before, business was considered to be for hire or reward. Now the Minister makes clear in the clause that we seek to amend that this will no longer be considered business.<br><br>
However, the man in that position will now be able to say "I have a car and it can take up to eight people". It may be only a five-seater vehicle, as we have said, but he can take up to eight people in it and he will be able to advertise a service between Heathrow and London. He will be able to take eight people instead of five, to which we seek to limit the number. He will have a list of charges enabling him to do that, charges which will have to be paid before he departs. That is a matter for enforcement and is another difficulty. He will be able to argue that that is now different from the previous law.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
What that driver will be doing is clearly illegal under the present legislation, but he already defies that. He will now claim that he is car sharing, and he will be allowed to charge separate fares. I am amazed that the Minister can say that that does not make any major change in the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that one of the conditions laid down in the Bill was that fares had to be paid before a journey was undertaken, but, with respect to my hon. Friend, that is not so. Clause 2(3)(<i>b</i>) says that the arrangements have to be made before a journey is undertaken. If it were the case that the fares had to be paid, that would be much less difficult to enforce. I believe that my hon. Friend's point will be strengthened if he reflects on the fact that it is only the arrangements that have to be made. Therefore, a policeman who stops the car at any point on the journey cannot ask whether the fares paid were in accordance with the ministerial directive and hope to have any chance of proving, because fares have not been paid, that these were not in accordance. All that the driver will have to say is that an arrangement has been made that the fares will be in accordance with the ministerial directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would rather that the right hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend did not reflect on that matter at present. Many of these arguments are perfectly valid at some point in the Bill, but if the hon. Gentleman wishes to discuss them now he will not get a debate on clause stand part because we shall have already discussed the clause. I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman restricts his remarks to the amendment if he wants to retain the possibility of a debate on clause stand part.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not pursue the powerful point made by my right hon. Friend. As you say, Mr. English, there will be other opportunities to develop that point.<br><br>
I conclude by saying that our contention is that "five" will improve the situation. It will not reduce the possibility of achieving the objective of the clause, which is to reduce congestion and encourage greater use of cars. In principle the amendment does not detract from that intention. Leaving the clause as it stands will under-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
mine the existing provision of services, as outlined by other industries. In many ways, what the Government call a provision for freeing the motorist is likely to become, as I said, the Fowler clause,—a tout's charter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is to clarify the clause, which is somewhat ludicrous in that "one or more" means from one up to about 10 million. That is going from the sublime to the ridiculous. On previous debates the Minister was clear that he had in mind eight passengers. On that basis, why did he say "one or more"? That means all things to all men.<br><br>
If—Heaven forbid—I were to leave this Committee, jump into a car and go to Heathrow, carrying the Bill as I undoubtedly will wherever I go, see 18 passengers standing there and cram them all into my car a policeman would undoubtedly ask me what I was doing. I would be able to say "Look, I have the full authority of the Minister. He tells me 'one or more'. Would you, as an officer of the law, flout the Minister's words of 'one or more'?" I am sure that that officer of the law would be suitably chastened. He would refer to the Home Office and say "The Minister of Transport has put me in a very ambiguous position. Please, Mr. Home Secretary, would you in terms of the law define 'one or more'?" That would create great difficulty. The Home Secretary would have to dash back to the Minister of Transport and say, "What did you mean?"<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to avoid that difficulty. As I said, "one or more" means all things to all men, but "not more than five" is specific. If, having carried the amendment, I then went to Heathrow with the same car and attempted to get those 18 people into the car, when the same policeman, much relieved because the amendment clarifies the position, approached me, it would be clear that I was breaking the law. That would save the policeman a long and tedious journey to the Home Office to see the Home Secretary, who would not need to dash to the Minister of Transport to ask what he meant, because the position would be perfectly clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman suffers from a misfortune that he does not yet realise; namely, that I once chaired the Local Government (Miscellaneous
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
Provisions) Bill in which was inserted an entire new part to enable local authorities to control exactly the circumstances the hon. Gentleman describes. Unfortunately, the local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, as it now is, is not this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the wonderful advice that I always receive from you, Mr. English. Nevertheless, if that is the case— and I have no reason to doubt that exactly what you say is true—would it not be sensible for us to put in "one to five" so that we know where we are? Even if there is a Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act—the Committee stage was no doubt ably chaired by you, Mr. English— I suggest that it would be sensible and logical to specify one to five here.<br><br>
There is another aspect. I do not know whether I shall occur your wrath again here, Mr. English, but the words "one or more" conjure up visions of a Mini travelling from Heathrow with passengers crammed in like sardines, because "one or more" has been interpreted to mean as many as the driver can cram in. The amendment would prevent that.<br><br>
Specifying one to five comes into the area of competition. The Government make great play of the fact that their provisions will mean a widening of choice and will give people more freedom. The Minister claims that this wider choice will be better for the consumer, but a wider choice without equal competition is surely contrary to everything that the Government stand for. The result of specifying "one or more" passengers will be that competition will be unfair. Without mentioning any names, those who operate a similar service on a professional basis at present are restricted to a certain defined number. Yet here the number is not defined. The Government, who represent those who, in the main, are against subsidies and unfair competition, are therefore themselves advocating a clause which would create precisely the kind of situation that they deplore.<br><br>
The immortal words "one or more" will create unfair competition. A hire car has a specific passenger carrying capacity. I will not mention taxis or the way in which their fares are calculated, as I wish to remain in order, but the number of passengers permitted is clearly defined and must not be exceeded. It has been said that hon. Members are not entirely immune in this context. If a vehicle carrying a number
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
of hon. Members in excess of that clearly defined number were stopped by the police, action could be taken.<br><br>
All that we are saying with the amendment is that, for goodness' sake, we must be realistic and ensure that the poor person outside who will have to read the Act does not have to sit up half the night scratching his head and turning to all and sundry to obtain a definition of "one or more". The poor policeman on duty when I arrived at Heathrow would then not be put in the ambiguous situation of having to do what the Minister is clearly not prepared to do— namely, to define what is meant by "one or more" passengers.<br><br>
I return to the subject of competition. Without going into arguments about fares or the sort of car involved, if we specify the limit of five everything will be clearly definable.<br><br>
There is another aspect in the clause. I hope that the Minister will give me his attention. He was most attentive when I spoke about the policeman, because clearly he shares my concern and I was grateful for his courtesy. That aspect is germane to those one or more people who, wisely or otherwise, might get into a car. How would they know at the time what their situation would be—whether that one or more is 10,000 or 18,000—in relation to the insurance risk? I should have thought that by our defining clearly that there should be not more than five, an insurance company would know specifically that there could be only five people in the car and could draft a clause to cover passengers. All members of the Committee will agree that we must seek to provide the best possible service for passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I can see the relevance of the hon. Gentleman's argument at some stage, but I repeat the point that I made earlier. If we stray from the amendment to, for example, insurance, or other things, by the time we come to the end of the amendments on the clause there will be no scope for a debate on clause stand part, which, I understand, his colleagues wish to have.<br><br>
While the subject of insurance might be perfectly relevant at some stage, I do not see that it is specifically relevant to the distinction between, say, two or three people, or any other number, and that is what we are discussing now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As usual, Mr. English, I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
appreciate your guidance. I found myself in some difficulty, because I was trying to keep within the terms of the amendment, yet refer to insurance that covered one to five passengers rather than one or more. However, in light of your ruling, I will save that ammunition for a later date.<br><br>
Regarding the provision of one to five, the present law lays down a figure of four for the hire trade in London. In the provinces the number is five. Behold! That magnificent number has already been used. One of the reasons for it relates to the qualifications of the driver. The law states that in order to drive a vehicle carrying five passengers, a driver must be suitably qualified and must go through a rigorous test.<br><br>
When the law specifies that it wishes to safeguard passengers and lays down a fixed number of people, and provides that a driver must pass vigorous tests, how can we logically state that for one or more passengers—which can mean an infinite number—no qualification other than the driving test is needed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to prevent the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central from sailing off on an argument that is based on a complete fallacy. There is no restriction on the number of passengers who can be carried in a vehicle driven by anyone carrying a valid driving licence. His driving licence allows him to carry as many people as he wishes in his car or even in a bus. The only restrictions are those that apply to businesses of various kinds, principally those of stage carriage services or of taxis, but we are not talking of business of any kind here.</span></p>
<p>11.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Committee. I think that the hon. Gentleman is confusing what is technically termed a hackney carriage—which people usually regard as a taxi, or a black cab— with a private hire vehicle. There is a legal distinction. Until the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 came into being I do not think that there was any control over private hire vehicles. Indeed, there is still no control if a local authority does not exercise its powers under that Act, as far as I am aware. That certainly applies to some local authorities.<br><br>
Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will now realise why I do not want all these things dragged into this discussion. What clearly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
excludes taxi and hackney carriages from the discussion is the fact that they carry passengers for a single fare. People often contribute to each other's fare, but in law they are carried for a single fare not separate fares, so they are clearly excluded from this. What excluded private hire vehicles is the fact that there was no law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. English, for that lucid explanation.<br><br>
I will end on this point. By accepting our amendment the Parliamentary Secretary has a chance to tighten up a very loose area which should be clearly definable. The Minister did not support that line of argument. He merely said that there is no law now. We have given him a glorious opportunity to accept this amendment to clear up a slack and unsatisfactory position. I am sure that in his wisdom he will accept our amendment because it makes much greater sense than his or his Department's or the Wizard of Oz's words—"one or more" passengers—which would mean all things to all men. There can be no doubt about, or misinterpretation of, "not more than five." I hope therefore that the Minister—who I can see is waiting to leap to his feet—will say that after listening to all those lucid points he will accept the amendment because we have now converted him to our way of thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wanted at this point to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a specific question because in principle the amendment makes much sense. It tidies up an area which can be quite confusing.<br><br>
The clause is about public service vehicle licensing and certain exceptions to that licensing under certain criteria. One of the criteria for making an exception is the noncommercial principle stated in subsection (3)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). Under certain circumstances, if a vehicle is run on what I understand to be an average total cost principle rather than a commercial principle, it is excluded. In subsection (1) there is provision for PSV licensing under the umbrella category of hire or reward. Under paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) passengers may be carried at separate fares in the course of the business of carrying passengers—and there is argument as to what a business is. We do not yet know what a business is because we have not seen the regulations, so this is something that we are debating in the dark. There are varying definitions of a business
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
and of a commercial principle, but we cannot debate that, unfortunately, because we have no idea of what the regulations will be.<br><br>
The question that I want to ask is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is getting on to amendment No. 61, which is two selections away. If he studies that amendment, he will find that the Government are not proposing to make any regulations. We shall seek to persuade the Committee to delete from the Bill the regulation-making power which caused great concern to Opposition Members from the moment that it was first mentioned, and which they have consistently misinterpreted.<br><br>
There never were going to be elaborate regulations and, having looked at the matter again, I believe that there is no need for regulations at all. I shall explain that when we reach amendment 61, which bears directly on the point that is troubling the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was clear in my mind about what I was going to say when I got up, but I am not now.<br><br>
However, I shall pursue the point. Under subsection (3) what is to stop somebody bringing a large bus on to the road, provided that he can negotiate the gap between the average total cost principle and not being a business? As I understand the matter—before the Minister rises to confuse me again—that is excluded by subsection (1)(<i>b</i>) in its reference to more than eight passengers. My question is why the Minister cannot clear up the whole matter by tabling an amendment to subsection (3) to confirm that we are talking about a vehicle with eight passengers. That would be easy and would remove all the ambiguity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will appreciate, Mr. English, that we are under considerable difficulty in debating this subject, as we have to deal with the Bill as it is printed and not as though amendment No. 61 had been carried. Therefore, we must discuss this amendment, which would limit to five the number of passengers that can be carried on a car-sharing basis on the assumption that the fare—or aggregate fares—that might be charged will be the subject of a ministerial directive.<br><br>
Because the Bill refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>"the fare or aggregate of the fares".</p></blockquote>
we must assume that the distinction between running a taxi and a hire car might
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0147">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
not be appropriate. It would depend on how the Minister chose to use his power. He could choose to lay down a fare, or he could choose to use his power in respect of aggregate fares. The wording of the Bill makes that clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman is really talking about the next amendment. I suggest that if he stops discussing it now we shall reach it more quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. English, I am talking not about the next amendment, but about the conditions that will change according to whether five or eight passengers will be permitted for sharing. That will make a crucial difference to a practical problem in the operation of car sharing arrangements.<br><br>
However, before developing that point I should like to make clear that part of our difficulty arises directly from what the Minister of Transport said at our previous sitting. Since then, we have consulted those who are engaged in this business. The Minister said, when replying to the amendment that I moved concerning the raising of the threshold for PSV vehicles from seven to eight, that I was making heavy weather of the matter. While he conceded —not very generously, I feel—that I might make the point about its implications on EEC regulations, he insisted that:
<br><blockquote><p>"We may talk of the European dimension, but basically we are here concerned with vehicles for private car sharing".[<i>Offical Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 15 January 1980;c.218.]</p></blockquote>
It was the Minister who suggested that in raising the number that may be carried to eight he was principally concerned with private car sharing—not with minibuses or buses operating for hire. If the Minister attaches such importance to car sharing and—we must assume—he wants to see people sharing cars that have eight passenger seats—the amendment is crucial. Should sharing be allowed on the basis provided in the Bill—of cars with up to eight passenger seats—or should it be limited to five? That is the point that concerns us. Therefore, I believe that I am justified in contending that the fares which may be charged for five passengers as opposed to eight—given that it is operated in the way that happens now—is of vital importance to the argument.<br><br>
Those who make a living by selling the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
service of carrying people in cars—hire cars, or minibuses—are not necessarily law-abiding citizens. I regret that that is so, but I make that statement on the evidence of those engaged in the trade. They tell me that, unfortunately, among the small percentage of the population who are not law-abiding citizens, a large proportion of them are engaged in this trade. If there is a loophole in the law which enables them to make more profit from carrying people in vehicles, they are likely to use it.<br><br>
Let us take the example of the difficulties faced by airport authorities in respect of those who go on to their premises and say to people "I have a car outside and I will take you to such-and-such a place". They then charge fares that are totally illegal. They do not have hackney carriage licence plates. If discovered they may have to pay a fine in court, but they promptly go back and do the same thing again. No doubt the trade is so profitable that it is well worth while.<br><br>
We appreciate just how difficult it is to enforce legislation. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) that one thing is simple. A policeman can easily count the number of people in a vehicle. It is similar to our argument about seat belts and crash helmets. The Government's argument was that one could see whether someone was wearing a crash helmet, and that there was virtue in a law that was so easily enforced. However, as it stands the Bill is virtually unenforceable.<br><br>
I accept his point that the car sharing provisions that exist as the result of a Bill introduced by a Labour Government may be difficult to enforce. However, there are fair and proper differences and distinctions. So we are considering not just an increase from seven seats to eight, but whether that should be done against the background of a virtually unenforceable ministerial directive about fares and where wider advertising of the service could be undertaken.<br><br>
Therefore, one of the grounds that we can advance for reducing the number of seats from eight to five is that it will be less tempting for that small, non-law abiding section of our community to try to use the legislation to make money at the expense of law-abiding taxi drivers. They might use the loophole of the Bill to run vehicles with up to eight passengers. When challenged as to whether they were plying illegally they might say "I am sharing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
this car with these other eight people, and it was arranged before we left on this journey that the amount which is to be paid will cover only my running costs". I suggest that there is very little a policeman could do to check such a statement. He cannot follow that vehicle to its destination to see what money is handed over by each of those eight people in order to check on that statement. Even if we did not have the proposal to increase the number from seven to eight, it would be important to consider the amendment. There could be a case for reducing the number to five even if it were not to be easier to have car sharing provisions.<br><br>
This provision, as the Bill stands, is not subject to limitations on where the journeys may be run. Therefore, there will be a temptation to run them in competition not only with taxi drivers, but with other proper, legal, licensed operators on other public services. That forms part of our concern about the amendment, but we shall come to the other points in due course and we shall have to look at the matter again in the light of amendment No. 61 if that is carried.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make just one brief point before the Minister replies, and this is a genuine query. As I understand matters, "one or more" passengers means one or more up to the maximum of eight which, regrettably, was approved when we considered a previous amendment.<br><br>
If there are nine passengers how does that affect the vehicle? Does it become a public service vehicle or can the policeman arrest the occupants? What, exactly, is the legal status of a vehicle carrying a driver and nine passengers—does it become a public service vehicle? Should there not be a limit which would assist in enforcement?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Plainly, it would help to bring the debate into context if I begin by explaining how the amendments relate to clause 2 and exactly what we are talking about.<br><br>
I hope to be able to satisfy Labour Members that the amendments and the part of the Bill about which they are concerned relate only to non-commercial, nonprofit making car sharing among individuals. We are talking about the real world and we seek to encourage a common sense arrangement whereby people, none of whom has an interest in a business running
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
hire cars, taxis or anything else, agree to make a journey and to divide the costs amongst themselves for running a vehicle on a journey. The context in which we are looking at private car sharing is in defining what is a public service vehicle. That is the whole purpose of clause 2.<br><br>
First, to be a public service vehicle, whatever its size or however many people are in it, a vehicle has to be used for hire or reward. If it is so used and is above a certain size, it is a PSV, however it may be run. The size is determined by subsection (1)(<i>b</i>). If the vehicle is adapted to carry more than a driver and eight passengers, nine people in all—to clarify a point which troubled hon. Members at the beginning of the debate at our last sitting—and is being used for hire or reward, it is a public service vehicle. Therefore, we are concerned about smaller vehicles.<br><br>
In the case of a smaller vehicle being used for hire or reward, it is only a public service vehicle—however it is being run— if it falls within subsection (1)(a) which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"used to carry passengers at separate fares"—</p></blockquote>
that is the phrase that cuts out hire taxis—
<br><blockquote><p>"in the course of a business of carrying passengers".</p></blockquote>
The Opposition amendment bears on the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"in the course of a business",</p></blockquote>
because clause 2 (3), an amendment to which is being discussed, is meant to clarify the circumstances in which a journey is not being made in the course of a business. It is not being made in the course of a business, and, therefore, this smaller vehicle is not a public service vehicle, when it is non-commercial, non-profit making private car sharing. That is prescribed in the clause.<br><br>
The Opposition must make up their minds about their attitude towards car sharing, because we are concerned with that. In essence, the Bill—although the phrasing is different because of the changes that we have made—is making two substantive changes and members of the Committee will understand that I am attempting to paraphrase in ordinary language the legal consequences of the Bill. There are only two proposed changes between our Bill and the Act of the previous Labour Government. First, we propose to increase the permitted number of passengers in a vehicle by one, which was debated on the last amendment. Secondly, we intend to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0149">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 259</span>
remove the restrictions on advertising.<br><br>
Those are our changes, but the amendment seeks to make a further change which is restrictive when compared with the previous Labour Government's legislation. The amendment seeks to reduce the maximum number of passengers from seven to five and is a complete reversal of the policy behind the 1978 Act. It is an attempt to impose a new restriction on the ability to engage in private car sharing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister does not want to mislead the Committee, but he is saying that the Government propose only two substantial changes. He mentioned the number of seats and the advertising, but he ignored the ministerial directions on what will constitute charges, which will be held only to be charges for covering the cost of the journey, and will therefore rule out car sharing as a business operation. Even if one leaves aside the question whether that is enforceable, the Minister must surely concede that that is a third change in the law which is significant in the context of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall seek to explain on a later amendment that that is one change which, on reflection, we are seeking to abandon. However, it was not a change of substance. If the right hon. Gentleman presses me, I shall have to explain what was in our minds when we first put that in, but it was never in our minds to make the changes he described.<br><br>
There is no change of substance in that part of the Bill, because it contemplates precisely what the previous Government's Act contemplated—non-profit making, non-commercial activities. The reference to directions is in that context only. It was thought necessary to take a power to give directions in order to clarify the way in which one calculated the running costs, for the same purpose as the previous Labour Government's legislation—in order to make sure that the exemption was given only to non-profit making, non-commercial activities, and that remains our intention. I have pointed out that that is a change of policy, but the amendment proposes a new restriction to reduce the number of passengers who may be carried.<br><br>
During today's debate, my concern has been to discover the Opposition's attitude to car sharing. I hope that they have not been persuaded by a commercial lobby, though that would explain why they keep
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
referring to taxi drivers and bus operators. Have those people sold the Opposition on the amendment? They have a perfectly understandable concern and it is no criticism to describe them as a commercial lobby, but the Opposition have been tempted by that commercial lobby into tabling restrictive amendments to car sharing.<br><br>
I know that Oppositions are organised in a looser way than are Governments, but I trust that Labour Members have consulted their colleagues who used to be in the Department of Transport and those who are now spokesmen on energy. They are seeking to impose a restriction on car sharing, which I should have thought is widely accepted to be a contribution that the transport world could make to the saving of energy and the reduction of congestion on our roads.<br><br>
Those responsible for transport policy in this country—the Opposition have a shadow responsibility—must accept that transport has to make a contribution to energy saving. The biggest waste of energy that takes place in transport is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Private cars.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) anticipates me. We are all agreed that it is the wasteful use of the private car. It is therefore the intention of the Government, and, I would have hoped, of the Labour Party, to achieve better utilisation of the private car. The Government's intention is not simply to legalise what goes on now. As my right hon. Friend has made clear, the Government's policy is positively to encourage the growth of private car sharing. The single driver, sitting in his car making a journey which he could share with someone else sitting in a separate car behind him in the same traffic jam, makes one of the most wasteful uses of energy in transport.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I follow the Minister's argument, but he seems to stop short. He argues that the Government wish to encourage the fuller utilisation of the private car, because that in itself will save energy. To a certain extent one can agree with that.<br><br>
But surely the logical conclusion of that argument is that more energy would be saved by filling a bus, and restricting the use of the car. There would have been a great deal of logic in the Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
following that line. The argument does not apply only to buses. If car journeys were shorter, and people made the rest of their journeys by rail, even more energy would be saved.<br><br>
However, the Minister is suggesting that everyone should dash out to buy an eight-seater vehicle. Petrol consumption will increase. The Department of Energy will come to him and say "What are you playing at?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we return to the discussion of the rest of the Bill, we shall see that most of it is concerned with the encouragement of the use of public transport, and buses.<br><br>
A Government—including the previous Government—should draw a distinction between a commercial lobby and a general view of transport. We believe that greater encouragement of public transport, and the use of the bus, is not in conflict with the encouragement of private car sharing.<br><br>
Like most commercial lobbies, the bus operators and taxi drivers, or at least some of them, have an exaggerated view of the threat to their business which is posed by any encouragement of private car sharing. They take the view, as do far too many transport lobbies, that anything that is of assistance to any other form of transport is inimical to their own commercial interests, and that they should therefore be "agin" it. Hence the rail lobby spends all its time proposing restrictive legislation for the roads, while the road lobby spends all its time trying to do down investment in rail. Some taxi drivers and bus operators will go to the Opposition and persuade them to try to undermine the whole principle of car sharing.<br><br>
The situation in London would be greatly improved if all the commuters who currently jam themselves into London could be encouraged to make more use of buses and the underground wherever possible. There are many in London for whom the bus and the underground are not possible. If for some reason people do not wish to or cannot use public transport, they could be encouraged to make more sensible use of the private car. If those who insist on going, or have to go, by private car, could sometimes share the car and reduce the number of vehicles on the road, they will assist the public transport system by taking some of the congestion out of the way of the buses.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, although the Minister is usually a fairly logical person, there is a fault in his logic here. If car sharing increases, some of the people involved will previously have driven their own cars. There will therefore be a gain in energy and a saving of road space. However, a number of people attracted to car sharing will formerly have travelled by public transport. In that case, there will be an energy loss and an increase in the amount of road space used by private cars commuting.<br><br>
As far as I know, no one has yet carried out a significant survey of which is the predominant change. Until we have firm figures on the predominant source of car sharers an element of caution is called for. Otherwise, the Minister's reasonable intentions will harm, not benefit from his proposals.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see the relevance of the argument to the clause as a whole. But I must again point out that we are discussing only a very narrow amendment that, in effect, says delete "eight" and insert "five". Many of the arguments now being put forward would be better left for a broader discussion later.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely, Mr. English and I have been constrained to a general exposition on the clause on the principles of car sharing.<br><br>
I acknowledge the point that has been made, although it is not as simple as that. Some people will be making better use of their cars, and some—a few—will be drawn from public transport. But we shall discuss that on clause stand part.<br><br>
The approach to car sharing is what lies behind the amendment. Because of their fears of the effect car sharing will have on other trades the Opposition are proposing a new restriction. Presumably they agree with the general principles I have expounded, they would like to see informal car sharing up to five passengers and they see nothing wrong with the two men I described in the traffic jam getting together and agreeing to share the cost. But, no doubt in response to the lobbying they have listened to, they suggest that it is desirable to restrict the total number of passengers in that informal commonsense arrangement to a total of no more than five passengers.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
One of the disadvantages of the present arrangements is that car sharing, although encouraged by everyone in principle, is still surrounded by a few silly restrictions. I do not want to be too harsh in my language in dealing with this amendment, but it proposes a fairly silly restriction. I do not see how an attack on public transport is posed by six, seven or eight people in the few vehicles that are adapted to that sort of size, presumably with the occasional minibus or van, occasionally wishing to travel to work together. I do not see a great challenge to either the interests of public transport or the safety of the passengers, and so on, expounded in speeches on the amendment.<br><br>
The amendment proposes a new restriction, despite all that has been said about the Government's minor proposals changing the whole concept. The amendment is more restrictive than anything the previous Government proposed. It will be quite wrong for the Committee to put fresh curbs of this artificial kind on the practice of car sharing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister to clarify again the point he made, very firmly, at the beginning of his remarks. He said that if a vehicle carries more than eight people it will be considered a public service vehicle. Will the Minister consider two or three possibilities in a rural area. Take, for example, 30 people working in a factory some miles distant from the village in which they all live. Those 30 people could be travelling to work in separate cars. If they get together and obtain an old bus in which to travel to work on a co-operative basis, dividing the running costs between them, is the Minister sure that they will be prevented from doing that by subsection (1)? They will still be engaged in an arrangement which is for hire or reward, although there is no element of profit, but are simply covering their costs by a commonly agreed arrangement?<br><br>
However, if they combine to buy four minibuses, and each minibus is carrying fewer than eight but more than five people, they will be able to do that under the provisions of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the question whether I am satisfied that thirty people will be in a public service vehicle is "Yes". Even though there is no profit in the circumstances described, they would still
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
be travelling for hire or reward. In answer to the second question, if they divided themselves into groups of eight, or nine including the drivers, and used minibuses in a cost sharing arrangement, the provisions of the Bill would not define that as involving a public service vehicle.<br><br>
You, Mr. English, have constantly reminded both sides of the Committee that the point under discussion is a very narrow one. The narrowness is shown by the fact that under the present law it would be quite legal to do that without any kind of licence so long as there were no more than seven people and a driver in the vehicle. We have spent three hours discussing whether the maximum figure should be increased by one to eight, or reduced by two to five.<br><br>
It is conceivable that there is nothing wrong with the arrangement described by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis). Most of us would be hard pressed to say why such an arrangement is brought under licensing.<br><br>
As was explained during an earlier discussion, the figure of eight was chosen only to bring us more closely into line with European practice. Only our regard for European practice has kept it down to eight. I do not say that we would have accepted them, but we should certainly have been more tempted by Opposition amendments pressing us to increase the figure and encourage car sharing. Government policy is definitely to encourage and extend the practice of car sharing for reasons of energy saving. I ask the Committee to reject this attempt to take us back to a limit of five passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Considerable time has been taken over the amendment. I shall not prolong the discussion much further. But we do not accept that it covers a narrow point, or that it does not have considerable consequences. We have outlined some of those consequences. There is a considerable difference between the two sides of the Committee on the amendment, not merely a semantic one. Since the Minister is having difficulty understanding the differences, we may outline them on clause stand part, and say why we moved an amendment that may appear somewhat contrary to legislation passed by a previous Labour Government. The distinction depends on one's interpretation of "course of a business".<br><br>

The Minister did not tell us in his concluding remarks whether it would be quite proper for a man to make five or six journeys. It would be quite proper. There would be nothing to prevent it. I take the Minister's nod as a reply. We shall debate on clause stand part whether anyone making five or six journeys on the same day, with five or eight passengers, will be persuaded by whether he can carry five or eight—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No one will travel to and from Heathrow five or six times if he cannot make a profit and cover his running costs. That is why I did not go into all those arguments that described things which are totally illegal as the Bill stands. We are talking about people in a business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is blind to the fact that the Bill will make legal some existing practices that are now illegal. We shall wait until clause stand part to enlarge on that. We are talking about reality, about what will be imposed by the Bill. We shall reach the definition of profit later in our deliberations. There is a clear distinction between the two parties on the issue.<br><br>
I resent the assumption that the Opposition have been pressed by a commercial lobby. It is not the sort of lobby to which I</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 40, in page 3, line 11, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"or the aggregate of the fares paid" and insert "paid by any passenger".</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 40 can be taken as a paving amendment for amendment No. 41, as the two could, with consistency, be passed by the Committee and</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
<p>have given particular preference during my short period in Parliament. Yes, I am prejudiced, though not necessarily in that specific area.</p>
<p>However, I should like to point out to the Minister that the amendment was put down weeks ago, when we were attempting to understand the purpose of the Bill. Those representatives of the taxi trade whom we met were from the Transport and General Workers Union, which is not known for its advocacy of commercial interests. If the argument were true, that sort of thinking and motive might apply to the Government's amendments, which were put down only in the past couple of days, to take out whole sections of the clause and change the character of what it imposes. Can we assume that that was done because car drivers were pressing the Minister not to place regulations or controls on them? In fact, I do not assume that, but I shall wait to hear the argument.</p>
<p>However, we believe, that there are distinct differences between us. We have had difficulty in expounding some of them— sometimes through the interpretation of a narrow point—but we wish to take the amendment to a vote.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>
<p>that would be logical for the Bill, or it could be regarded separately on its merits. Our difficulty stems from the way in which the Minister has expressed his sentiments on the issue and the way in which the Bill has been drafted.</p>
<p>He says that he is in favour of sweeping away all the outdated, historical regulations which are no longer relevant, to allow far greater freedom for the individual. That is not an untypical Conservative sentiment. He suggests that the Opposition are wedded to the idea of keeping maximum control and licensing, which is a caricature of the real position. That has been demonstrated in some of our previous debates.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
<p>Here is an instance of where the Minister in drafting the Bill makes very clear the distinction between where he wants regulation and where he wants freedom. Strangely for a Conservative Minister, he draws the distinction on the question of whether a profit will be made. In other words, if I have correctly understood the drafting, the Minister wants strongly to encourage people to charge, but not to make a profit. I thought that the Conservatives were greatly in favour of encouraging people to make profits.</p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p>The way in which the Minister proposes to proceed is to take a power to make a directive about the fare or aggregate of fares to be paid in respect of the car sharing journeys. If it is not consistent with all the sentiments that have been expressed, at least the principle is clear. As the Parliamentary Secretary has fairly said, it is no different from the principle involved in existing car-sharing legislation, although we believe that there are distinct differences in its application in respect of the greater number of seats, advertising, and so on. Therefore there is greater temptation to use the legislation as a cover for illegal operation.</p>
<p>In any case, even if that were not so we should have to examine whether it would be possible to enforce or police such an arrangement. The Minister proposes a sort of persuasive directive as to how one should calculate a fare that will not produce a profit—that is, a break-even arrangement—with scales for different cars, carrying different numbers of passengers. Perhaps the figure would be 10p a mile for a Mercedes, charged as an aggregate to all the passengers—that is, 5p to each if there are two—which would be very difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that it would be much simpler to carry the first amendment. In other words, there would be a fare and at least the directive would state what that fare should be. To that extent, it would not be a new area of experience in British law—it would be akin to the taxi. A fare is determined by a combination of considerations from local government law and that administered by the Home Office. However, the concept of a fare is not strange to British legislation.</p>
<p>If that were known, it would be much simpler to go on to amendment No. 41 which lays down that the fare would have to be divided by the number of passengers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
to determine the maximum that could be charged to any one passenger. So if it is a fixed fare for a journey of any given distance—perhaps £10, although it could be a lot more, of course, if we are to be logical about present day costs, that would be £5 each for two passengers. At least people would know where they stood and enforcement would be more likely.</p>
<p>The way in which the Bill is drafted, which suggests that fares or aggregate fares will be determined by ministerial direction, leads us into many difficulties. I suggest that the Minister, when he contemplates the matter—as I hope he has done in the light of the Second Reading debate, because he now has an amendment down to withdraw this part of the Bill—decides that a reasonable running cost fare would be something similar to that which Members of Parliament are allowed to claim, for example, or the cost that the RAC or the AA work out. That might be 10p for a certain vehicle</p>
<p>Let us take the case of my private car. If I were to say to a couple of my constituents who were visiting to me "When do you want to go back to Barrow-in-Furness?" They might reply "On Friday night," to which I might add "What a happy coincidence. I am going there on Friday night. That will be 300 miles at 10p a mile. You give me £30 and I will take you." Of course that would be a ridiculous proposition, but if it is done on the logical basis that is suggested in the amendment and divided by the number of passengers, at least the legal position would be clear.</p>
<p>I do not wish to draw out the argument to any great extent. I merely want to say that if any directions are given by the Minister as to the fare or aggregate of fares, that allows for considerable scope of interpretation. It is true that if one could discover what arrangements were made in each case and tot up, one could check whether the aggregate of fares collected was the same.</p>
<p>One of the points made on the previous amendment was that in practice it has been found that wherever authorities have tried to enforce the law controlling charges, it has been extremely difficult, if not impossible, and the breach of the law has proved extremely lucrative to the extent that people who have breached it many times and been fined continue to operate that way.</p>
<p>There is the difficulty of enforceability.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
There is also the necessity for clarity in this difficult calculation of what constitutes a payment which will exactly cover costs but not involve any element of profit. That is the acid test of present legislation which up to now has now been subject to Ministerial direction and which, if the Bill were passed in its present form, would be so subject. If that is to be operated in a logical intelligible way that will be understood by our citizens, I suggest that the two amendments would help towards that end.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is genuine concern about this matter. Amendments Nos. 40 and 41 seek to clear up the clause. Lest anyone is under the misapprehension that the concern comes only from this side of the House, let me quote from the Second Reading debate on 27 November when the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall)—who spoke a lot of sense—said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The concern arises mainly on the car sharing provisions. In particular, that concern centres on the implementation of the provision to deal with advertising."</p></blockquote>
He continued—this is the main concern in relation to the clause:
<br><blockquote><p>There is also concern about the monitoring of costs. How can the authorities monitor whether the correct fare is being charged? It is difficult to see how charging and running costs will be dealt with.</p></blockquote>
The main point which the hon. Gentleman made with which I entirely agree was:
<br><blockquote><p>I am concerned about protection for the public on car-sharing. I do not know how the public will discover what is their contribution of a journey, or how it is devised.—[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol.974, cc.1173–74].</p></blockquote>
That is the nub of the two amendments. The clause as drafted states:
<br><blockquote><p>"or aggregate of the fares paid"</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 40 seeks to make that more specific by inserting the words "paid by any passenger." Amendment No. 41 seeks to clarify it further by inserting the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"divided by the number of persons travelling in the vehicle."</p></blockquote>
What is being advocated there is quite clear. A person gets into the car—we still have "one or more" but we will take it that there are only seven people in the vehicle. He then knows that he will pay one-seventh of the cost of that journey. It would help people making such a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
journey to know what they had to pay. It would cover those people who, inevitably, would tout, would try to break the law and who, contrary to the Government's wish—the Government want them to recover the bare running costs—would try to make a profit. No one in this room is so naive as to believe that there are people who would not seek to make a profit.<br><br>
In the interest of the passengers, the amendments try to clarify and to provide formula whereby they at least have a chance to work out what they will have to pay before the journey starts and if there is an attempt to overcharge on the running costs of the vehicle they would have some method of redress—for example, if there were seven passengers in the car, each would know that he had to pay one-seventh. The clause as drafted does a disservice to the public because a potential passenger would not know, under its present provisions, how he would work out the aggregate of fares paid. But he would know if the wording of amendment No. 41 was inserted.<br><br>
Another relevant point that needs clarification is the question of
<br><blockquote><p>"the running costs of the vehicle for the journey"</p></blockquote>
Again, this needs to be defined to help the passenger to work out what is being paid. The running costs for the journey must be specified. If both amendments were accepted the cost would be abundantly clear to the passenger. Also the provision
<br><blockquote><p>"divided by the number of persons travelling in the vehicle"</p></blockquote>
would be in the legislation and he would not have to be a mathematical genius to work out what he would have to pay. But the clause as drafted does not give members of the public guidance on how to work out a reasonable figure to be charged. I appeal to the Minister on this. Neither he nor I would wish to see people touting for profit. The best way of overcoming the problem would be by accepting both amendments which would clarify the law on car-sharing in the interests of the travelling public.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I see the two amendments, they would have two effects, namely, to clarify part of the Bill and impose restrictions on when a car was or was not a public service vehicle.<br><br>
If the amendments were included, the vehicle would be a public service vehicle unless no passenger paid more than his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
precise share of the cost, or the driver paid his share of the cost. The effect of amendment No. 41 is certainly to bring the driver within the number of people among whom the fare is to be divided. I see that the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) definitely intended that to be so.<br><br>
I shall deal with the second point first. It would have an unintentionally undesirable effect. It would seriously affect social car schemes which rely on volunteer drivers. The WRVS has an arrangement whereby social car schemes are run and the cost is divided among the passengers. The driver is not expected to make a contribution, he being a volunteer providing the service. I am sure that that was not intended, but that would be one of the inadvertent effects of the amendment.<br><br>
Leaving aside that point, which I am sure was accidental, I suggest that it is wrong to try to tie down so rigidly the dividing of the cost among the passengers in the way I have described. The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) said it would give certainty to passengers, but it would mean that the vehicle was then a public service vehicle requiring a licence and so on, if any one passenger paid more than his exact share of the cost.<br><br>
We are trying to cover informal arrangements made among people before the journey starts—that is the point of subsection (3)(<i>b</i>), which cuts out plying for hire— whereby they come to an agreement before they start about how they are to share the costs of the journey.<br><br>
Let me give an example which came to mind when I was listening to the hon. Gentleman. Say two people are going out for a day's fishing and sharing a car. One says to the other, "We'll go in your car, and I'll pay for the petrol." In the course of the day's journey they drive, say 100 miles there and back. One chap drives—it is his car so that is his contribution—and the other pays for the petrol. As matters stand, that would be a quite legitimate arrangement. The man paying for the petrol could legitimately be argued to be paying the fare, certainly if he afterwards reimbursed the driver for the petrol that had been put into the vehicle. Obviously, because he has paid only for the petrol used on the journey the fare does not exceed the total running costs of the journey. But who knows whether those costs have been exactly divided? Who makes the calculation that the contribution
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
from the owner of the car by way of depreciation, insurance and so forth involved in providing the car is exactly equal to that form the passenger who is paying for the petrol?<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
All that the two men know is that the owner of the car, who is the driver, is not making a profit. The man making the contribution knows that that does not exceed the cost of the journey and can say that it is an arrangement between them. It would not make the world a simpler place if it were decided that that was a public service vehicle unless the fare paid by the passenger did not exceed the total running costs divided by the total number of persons in that vehicle. Therefore, I do not believe that the amendment would bring about clarity in the law. One would have to try to work out whether the amound paid for the petrol was exactly hall the total running costs, because if that amount exceeded one half of those costs it would appear that the vehicle would be required to be licensed.<br><br>
That is an off-the-cuff example and I may have made an error as I went along, but I hope that it brings out what matters and what the Bill achieves, which is that the total paid by the passengers, in whatever way they have agreed among themselves to pay the fares before the journey starts, does not exceed the running costs. Once those fares exceed the running costs we enter into all those fears that have dominated today's debate about people going to Heathrow and making a profit from the journey. But so long as the total of the fares does not exceed the running costs, whoever pays those fares—even if one chap pays three quarters of the costs and he is happy with that, that constitutes private car sharing. That is the sort of thing we wish to encourage and we certainly do not want to bring that within the requirements for road service licences, with people having to go before traffic commissioners and so forth.<br><br>
I believe that the amendments were tabled in an exploratory way with a view, no doubt, to seeking clarity. However, they would bring unreal rigidity into the arrangements. I realise that what troubles right hon. and hon. Gentlemen is the calculation of running costs and how that aspect is to be enforced. I respectfully suggest that the best way to deal with that will probably be found in the great body of amendments that are grouped with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
Government amendments seeking to take out the direction-making power.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amazing changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to satisfy the hon. Gentleman that these are not amazing changes at all and that he has always held beliefs and suspicions about our direction-making power that were never justified. The Opposition's proposal would incidentally, knock out the WRVS and its social car scheme, which I am sure no one wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary invites us to take flights of fantasy. Let me deal with his case of the man who offers a car-sharing arrangement on the basis that he will pay for the petrol. Joe says to Bill "Is it okay if we go fishing this weekend, using your car, if I pay the petrol costs?" I do not imagine for a moment that any member of the Committee seriously believes that on the basis of the amendment being carried that a policeman will stop that car on its way to the coast or some exquisite fishing water to ask "What arrangement has been made for payment for this journey?" That is not the intention, nor would it be the effect, and I suspect that the Parliamentary Secretary knows that.<br><br>
The Minister seems really keen to encourage car sharing on a much wider basis that that. He wants a driver to get eight passengers on board his vehicle with him. The Minister said that very clearly in our last sitting. It is in those circumstances that we have to look at the way in which maximum costs would be shared as laid down by any ministerial directive. In practice, from the way in which the average British citizen operates—I know that to be dangerous territory—and from my own experience of the arrangements made by people, it is not uncommon to share petrol costs. It is the most common type of cost sharing. Therefore, if a car owner offers to take friends to a social, working or any other function it is not uncommon for those friends to chip in a bit and share the petrol costs. On the basis of most of the calculations that have been made regarding the majority of vehicles in this country, the petrol costs do not exceed half the total cost of running the vehicle—the wear, tear, depreciation, tax and insurance. Therefore,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
even in the case quoted by the Parliamentary Secretary on the basis of the amendment being carried, there would not have been a breach of the law because the total petrol costs would probably be less than half the cost of running the vehicle. So I do not think his case has been made out.<br><br>
However, I do not want to drag on with the matter because that is not a life or death issue in the Bill. However, our amendment is perfectly reasonable, clear and understandable, and, since it mentions maximum fare arrangements only, it would safeguard against the minority about whom we are worried—the people who exploit, bend and break the law with their use of cars.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
the Opposition on Second Reading. I believe that we tabled our amendment after the Opposition tabled their amendments with which it is grouped, but they all relate to the same subject. The Opposition amendments are concerned with the circumstances in which we would exercise the direction-making power, and amendment No. 61 shows that upon consideration by the Government, forced in part by what was represented by the Opposition, we are withdrawing the direction-making power altogether.<br><br>
Perhaps the best way in which to anticipate the full flood of the Opposition's wrath which is about to hit me is to give a clear illustration of exactly what we are about. I realise, whatever is said, that the Opposition believe that we have just made a bonfire of elaborate regulations in draft that we were drawing up, specifying the fare levels and costs of every size of vehicle, in all circumstances, in response to their outraged complaints. I shall endeavour to go for a simple exercise in open government and explain how this innocent direction-making power first got into the Bill and how it was decided by the Government, upon reflection, that it is not worth bothering about.<br><br>
I remind the Committee that the purpose of clause 2(3)(<i>a</i>) is to make sure that we are dealing with circumstances where the total paid by the people in the car does not exceed the running costs of the vehicle for a journey. As I said in the last debate, in practice these will be informal arrangements of infinite variety. If the Committee wishes, we can carry on swopping examples of fishing and other trips, and how each person in the car is contributing to the cost. But these are informal arrangements and one wishes to avoid unnecessary and silly disputes about the exact basis upon which a vehicle is outside the definition of a public service vehicle and also make sure that there is enforcement against people acting illegally who may claim to be acting within these provisions.<br><br>
The Bill clearly states that the fare, or the aggregate of the fares, should not exceed the running costs. To make clear that the phrase "running costs" does not just mean the petrol and oil used on the journey, the end of subsection (3) clearly states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the running costs … shall be taken to include an appropriate amount in respect of depreciation and general wear."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
That means that the capital cost of the car can be taken into account in the same way as calculating mileage allowances for business purposes when employers reimburse employees for the cost of running their own vehicles in the course of their work. That is, therefore, made clear.<br><br>
It was thought that there would be further clarification if some directions were given by the Minister on how this was to be done. The fact that our aims were modest is reflected in the fact that we did not consider regulations. One of the amendments was concerned about the affirmative or negative resolution procedure. In fact, such directions could have been given in a letter, because we did not propose to do anything very dramatic.<br><br>
Two possibilities were considered on whether directions were needed. First, there might be a broad brush indication of a price per mile, to be taken as a figure which could not conceivably exceed the running costs of the vehicle. One could, therefore, give directions that if the aggregate of the fares did not exceed, say, 15p a mile the presumption was that that could not exceed the running costs of a vehicle. That might be harsh on the bigger vehicles and generous to the smaller ones. As the concern is largely expressed in respect of the larger vehicles that possibility had some temptations. But that is extremely crude and rough and ready, because it is not an exact calculation of the running costs in every case. It would also require constant amendment because inflation has proceeded, more or less, at a similar rate for some years and it would plainly be silly if the Minister had to keep issuing letters uprating the figure at intervals. Moreover, how would the public know the figure in the Minister's latest letter?<br><br>
The only other form of direction the Government contemplated was a possible broad indication of what types of cost should be included in the running costs. Again, on reflection, we consider that this is best determined, where there is contention, by commonsense consideration of the facts of every individual case. It is our intention that such items as insurance, road tax, depreciation and general wear should be taken into account, together with petrol and oil.<br><br>
Legislation and regulations fall into error, and the draftsmanship tends to be the poorer the more one tries to go into detail and to be specific to a minute extent on an approach to matters which are best
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
described in simple language and left to the commonsense judgment of tribunals and courts to decide the facts of the case on the evidence. The legislation will work better and will meet the infinite variety of circumstances that arise if we leave the subsection to read:
<br><blockquote><p>"the fare or aggregate of the fares paid in respect of the journey does not exceed the amount… of the running costs of the vehicle,"</p></blockquote>
with the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"taken to include an appropriate amount in respect of depreciation and general wear."</p></blockquote>
The directions we were contemplating would not add anything useful to that. It is possible that by trying to make directions Ministers would introduce complications and technical arguments because they failed to meet every circumstance, thereby making the position worse instead of better. We believe, therefore, that the wording of the Bill, without the direction-making power, is to be preferred.<br><br>
We consulted a wide range of interested parties, and if anyone influenced us in that decision more than any other it was the insurers. The motor conference put forward very valuable ideas and, as I understand from his reaction, the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), after discussions with his insurers, was most reluctant that the Minister should seek to be more precise. My understanding is that experience so far has not given rise to any difficulties in deciding whether an insured person is running a business that obviously concerns the insurers—and whether private car-sharing is profit making.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
In practice, difficulties did not arise from the general phraseology in previous legislation, and we believe that, for a change, the wording here is clear, and simple, and could readily be interpreted by the courts, if necessary. Therefore, I ask the Committee to make the amendment, together with the consequent amendment to take out subsections (4) and (5), which showed exactly what the direction-making power was. It would mean that the amendments that we are discussing, which, because of understandable fears, hedged round the order-making power, would not be necessary because we are taking away the whole power to give directions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
question? Let us consider the running costs of a vehicle. When the owner of a small vehicle also drives it, does the running cost include his wages or remuneration for doing that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my immediate response proves to be wrong, I shall reconsider it. However, my understanding of the matter is that such remuneration would not be included. Once one starts to include anybody's remuneration over and above the vehicle's running costs, one strays outside the subsection and into a business. If passengers are carried in the course of a business, whatever the size of the vehicle, it is a public service vehicle and the remainder of the provisions of the Act will apply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span> <i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to propose the Question at some stage. We are in danger of getting into a debate before that has been done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to wrath from this side. There is no wrath, but we have been put in a certain amount of difficulty. We were promised that we would have notes on clauses, which we have been given. Indeed, until yesterday we were working on those notes. There have been arguments such as those on the previous group of amendments when, as you rightly pointed out, Mr. English, we were out of order in pursuing the interpretation of the word "business." The definition of what is a legitimate charge and not profit—that is, the difference between a social contribution and what is being done in the name of business—has almost been removed by the Minister's action in deleting the clauses.<br><br>
As a lawyer he knows that he is giving up his responsibility to define in the legislation what are considered legitimate charges for car sharing, and to advise people if someone will be making a profit. It is all very well for the Minister to use the phrase "on reflection," but that is pretty rapid reflection. Our amendments concerning the matter have been down since before the recess. Only last week the Minister put down a number of amendments to clause 5 and we assumed that that was the beginning of the Government's reflections. However, the meaning of the Opposition's amendments suddenly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
dawned on someone. They are the obvious conclusion from the principles embodied in the Bill on how to enforce the clauses.<br><br>
The amendments linked with Government amendments No. 61 and 62 have been put down by the Opposition bearing in mind that the Government did not want anyone to make a profit from car sharing by way of making it a business.<br><br>
Taking into account the amendments that delete parts of the clause, the effect of this amendment is still that carrying people in a car under those circumstances will not be considered to be in the conduct of business. The Opposition generally assume business to mean profit. That does not necessarily follow, however. Nevertheless the point of difference here is in the interpretation of profit.<br><br>
We have had to wait for the Minister to explain the amendments, so that it is difficult to appreciate properly the implications of what he has said. That proves that we were right at the beginning of the Committee, when we said that we needed time to reflect on the implications of the clauses. That was the basis of the difference between the two parties right at the beginning of proceedings on the Bill. The Government have now confirmed that in the most savage way. Our view of the amendment proved in the end to be right.<br><br>
Despite all the promises of information and advise, here we are again with only the Minister's explanation to guide our reactions in a most complicated area. That justifies our probing and inquiries. The Minister said in his introduction that the Government have reflected on the Opposition amendments and reached the conclusion that perhaps it would be best to take out the sections concerned. He was concerned about the difficulty of enforcement, which has featured in our argument about the freeing of all controls.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will not say that we are wasting time. He must have time somehow to rush through these measures. This morning he has proved in the most positive way that time is needed for debate. We have repeatedly pointed out that Conservative Members should investigate the consequences of the Bill for their constituents, and show their Government which clauses should not be in the Bill, as we have tried to do. But it is no thanks to Conservative members that changes are being made. We are the only ones slogging away here, trying to point out some of the consequences of the Bill.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The sittings are on record. I believe that the hon. Gentleman who said "Rubbish" had an honourable mention in the dispatches.<br><br>
I shall not tempt you to bring me back to order, Mr. English. Nevertheless, it is proven that we need time not only to understand these important and difficult clauses but to prevent people being put into difficult circumstances if the clauses become law. The Minister has today accepted the consequences of our amendments, which presumably will fall if the subsections are deleted—that presented us with something of a dilemma as to what our attitude should be to their deletion. Clearly, we need to give the Bill proper consideration. So I hope that there will be no ministerial warnings to the Committee about time, particularly in view of what the Minister has just said. I know that he may be under certain instructions. We shall wait for the next meeting of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My eyes are streaming with tears. I rather suspect, however, that the hon. Gentleman may find an opportunity later to say what he is saying now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. English. However, that is the only indication that we have had lately. It was a pity that that message did not come. It might also have told us about the implications of some of the clauses.<br><br>
A number of thoughts arise immediately from what the Minister said to the Committee. I am sure that reflection will produce more. At the next sitting we shall probably have another opportunity to continue our probing of the implications of the deletions.<br><br>
My immediate reaction to some of the implications is that the Minister is saying that if the clauses were to remain, there would be considerable difficulties about the regulations, both with inflation and with interpretation by Parliament. He was honest enough to make the point. I do not know what is the legal position of a direction by letter. Clearly it is not the same as an order in Parliament, which is the way the law would be enforced. I presume that a letter from the Minister, however influential he is, is no more than a letter unless that can be produced in court, and I doubt that. It is only a code of practice, if that. It is not even called a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
code of practice. But we now do not have any direction, and that means that the courts must interpret the Bill.<br><br>
The Government are refusing to carry out their obligation and tell motorists that there are certain circumstances in which they may charge other people for travelling in their cars. But depreciation or proper charges are not spelt out.<br><br>
The Government said that a motorist carrying people in his or her car must not make a profit. That is still the position, as I understand it, of the Minister though, I am not sure that that is clear in the Bill.<br><br>
That is why we have tried to point out that different sized cars incur different expenses for different journeys.<br><br>
If the amendment is accepted, Parliament will leave the issue to the courts. Doubts have been expressed as to what is "profitable." The lawyers tell me that the definition of hire and reward is a complicated area of case law. Profit does not necessarily mean a surplus over costs. Surplus over costs is defined in some cases as not being reward. If reward does not mean profiting by one's action, we are getting near to the argument of the difference between business and simple car-sharing.<br><br>
What is more important is that the courts will have to decide. The courts do not receive this legislation and then start to interpret it for the citizens. They interpret it only in cases which appear before them. In a case where four or five people in a car—or eight, as is now possible —were involved in an accident and there were doubts about whether the driver was making a profit, that would have to be defined in court. If a profit was shown to have been made because insufficient direction had been given in the matter—the Government are now refusing to give it— the courts may decide that the driver was involved for hire or reward, and the insurance might no longer apply to those people. People have suffered grievous bodily damage in accidents and courts have awarded them thousands of pounds in damages. Such people may be deprived of such damages because of uncertainty about the definition of "profitable."<br><br>
The courts rule only after the damage is done, or the offence committed. People may commit actions that they are not aware are illegal. Endorsement of a licence may follow. Parliament gives no clear guidance except to say: "You are now
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
free. Use your car as you wish."<br><br>
If we now say to those people: "Use it as you wish, but we cannot tell you whether you are breaking the law. That is for the courts to decide" we are abdicating our responsibility to tell the people what the law is. We are giving that over completely to the courts.<br><br>
Admittedly, the interpretation of legislation has always been the role of the courts. But the Minister could, if he wanted to follow this difficult road, spell out what it means. It is difficult because inflation is rising. It is difficult for Parliament continually to be re-defining the laws. But will the Minister sacrifice those few individual innocents who may suffer the consequences of his refusal to be more definite? I do not think that that is a happy prospect for legislators who have the responsibility of protecting our citizens. That would be the very serious consequences of these amendments.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I am sure that other points will come out after consideration. I hope that Conservative Members, whose constituents will be involved as much as ours, will be concerned about the consequences of the Bill. If we can at least persuade them that the Minister has been convinced of half our arguments, perhaps we shall gain some credit in the Committee for putting forward arguments worthy of consideration and not be accused of time wasting.<br><br>
It is a pity that these amendments have fallen for debate on a Thursday when the Minister is not here, although I grant that that is the way in which the business of the Committee has developed. Nevertheless, it presents us with difficulties since the clause is so politically identified with the Minister, and in those circumstances, we find it most unsatisfactory to be faced with the prospect of making these amendments at this stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would assist me to warn my right hon. Friend of what awaits him if the hon. Gentleman could clarify exactly what he wants the Minister to say. Does he agree with the amendments? If so, what does he want my right hon. Friend to say that would make it necessary to delay the debate until the Minister can deal with it himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. I tried to give a clear answer before. There are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
important implications. The Opposition have to make up their minds whether they oppose the Government's amendment. Fine. But after six weeks the Government allow us only two hours for consideration of the clause and I do not apologise for not understanding its full implications. It is just past 12.45 p.m. and a number of my hon. Friends have strong feelings to express on the clause. Therefore, it is possible that we shall be discussing it at our next sitting.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked what we want the Minister to consider. Our views were expressed on Second Reading. We are against the damned Bill, but we are having to argue, within the context of the amendments, for the purpose of the Bill. That presents us with certain difficulties as the Committee has seen.<br><br>
There are difficulties in introducing a car-sharing principle in the way in which the Government are seeking. They assume that there will be no profit, and that people will not be encouraged to go into business. The Government do not want to encourage more private car hire business against the regulated taxi and private car hire business. They simply want the car sharing principle to be extended. We say that that will develop an area of pirate private car business. The Minister had thought that the Bill would provide protection against that. The subsections that the Minister is proposing to delete were an effort to prevent that development. That is a fair argument. But the Minister is now saying that he cannot prevent it in that way so he will leave it to the courts. He is therefore leaving the provision vague.<br><br>
It needs serious consideration. That is one of the major reasons why we cannot agree to what the Government are trying to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. It might help provide time for consideration if the Committee adjourned its proceedings a little earlier. In proposing that, it gives me an opportunity to give notice that at the next sitting it is the Government's intention to table a sittings motion so that we may have afternoon as well as morning sittings, beginning I suggest at half-past Four. I accept that we are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
making some progress. We are having helpful and constructive debates, but the Committee must realise that as we are at an early stage in clause 2 at the present rate of progress some years would go by before we had completed consideration of the Bill. Therefore, it seems that more time is needed for these interesting debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. It seems that the Minister is to move a sittings motion at the next sitting. He has not given any indication as yet as to its form, but it will obviously be one that will provide more time each week in which to debate the Bill. He has not defined the scope or what the period of additional sittings will be, and so on.<br><br>
I put it to you, Mr. English, that one of our difficulties in considering such a motion at present is to know how far the Government are prepared to progress with the Bill. We started Committee sittings on the basis of the Bill itself. We were assured by the Government, as you will recall, that we would be provided with notes on clauses, which have yet to be forthcoming and without which we shall find great difficulty in proceeding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member will no doubt be in order in making those remarks when we come to debate the sittings motion, as I assume we shall, on Tuesday morning. Meanwhile, it is certainly not a point of order. I suggest that we accept the Minister's welcome offer to move the adjournment of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. I should be grateful for your guidance. Have I given adequate notice of the motion on Thursday by indicating that my proposal will be Tuesday and Thursday afternoons beginning at 4.30 on each of those days?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is quite sufficient notice.</span></p>
