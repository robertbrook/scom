	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That, if the proceedings on the Insurance Companies Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Tuesday next at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Tebbit.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps a word of explanation might be appropriate. I propose to take all the Government amendments together, with the exception of amendment No. 4 which deals with a separate matter. So the debate on all the other amendments will take place in the debate on the first Government amendment. All the amendments, as hon. Members will have noticed, are Government amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Tebbit)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 10, line 9, leave out from "or" to the end of line 10 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Articles 2(2) and 3(1) of the Industrial Assurance (Northern Ireland) Order 1979."</p></blockquote>
If I may briefly explain the purpose of the amendments as they are the only part of the Bill which has not been considered already, I should emphasise that they are purely technical amendments to bring the Bill up to date. None of them makes any material change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 simply substitute references to the 1979 order for references to the old Acts. This arises because, since the Bill was brought down from the Lords, the Industrial Assurance (Norther Ireland) Order 1979 has been made and has come into operation. We have to take account of that, which I shall refer to as the "1979 Order". It is a pure consolidation of earlier Northern Ireland industrial assurance
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 3 deletes the requirement in part II of schedule 1 of the Bill for the Industrial Assurance Commissioner for Northern Ireland to report on his proceedings under the Insurance Companies Act 1974. That provision has become unnecessary because the 1979 order itself contains the requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments 8 and 9 are to schedule 3 of the Bill, which deals with consequential amendments to primary legislation. The first deletes the references to the repealed 1924 Act. The second brings in the 1979 order and makes the necessary modifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments 10 and 11 are to schedule 5 of the Bill, which deals with consequential repeals of primary legislation. They delete the references to the repealed 1924 and 1948 Acts. In their place, amendment No. 12 brings in the 1979 order and provides for the necessary repeal of some of its provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, these amendments are all required to bring the Bill up to date to take account of the change which has come about because of the 1979 order since the publication of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendments made:</i> No. 2, in page 10, line 28, leave out from "or" to the end of line 29 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Articles 2(2) and 3(1) of the Industrial Assurance (Northern Ireland) Order 1979."</p></blockquote>
No. 3, in page 11, leave out lines 37 to 42.— [	<i>Mr. Tebbit.</i>]</p>

	<div class='title'>REGULATIONS EXTENDED TO NORTHERN IRELAND BY SECTION 3</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 12, line 42, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Insurance Companies (Valuation of Assets) (Amendment) Regulations 1980 (S.I. 1980/5)."</p></blockquote>
This springs from a similar clause but not exactly the same. Since the Bill was brought down from the Lords a new statutory instrument has been made under the Insurance Companies Act 1974 and has come into operation; namely, the Insurance Companies (Valuation of Assets)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
(Amendment) Regulations 1980. Having been laid before Parliament on 25 January, they came into force on 15 February. They therefore need to be added to the list in schedule 2 of the secondary legislation that the Bill extends to Northern Ireland. No modifications are needed to take account of their extension. Once again, this is a matter where events have overtaken the Bill during its passage through Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
