	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we begin consideration of clause 5, I should like to draw the Committee's attention to two things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, amendment No. 134 to clause 6, this morning appeared as a starred amendment. In accordance with our usual custom it is now notionally unstarred for this afternoon sitting. I have not had the selection list reprinted, as there was only one change, but I should be grateful if hon. Members would add amendment No. 134 to the selection list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, regarding the suspension for dinner, I understand that there are likely to be two Divisions in the House at about 7 p.m. There may be only one. However, were there two Divisions at 7 p.m., it would be convenient if we adjourned then and resumed at 9 p.m. If there are not two Divisions I hope that everybody will understand that for every Division fewer one knocks a quarter of an hour off, and for every Division more one adds a quarter of an hour, and so on. If the sitting is suspended later the same principles apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The precise details will be given by the person in the Chair when we adjourn. Furthermore, at a later time those hon. Members who are here after dinner will be told of the rules applying for breakfast</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 6, line 32, after "require", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall be published by them".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 105, in page 8, line 26, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that no such action is taken without the proposal being published by them".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is designed to place an obligation on the traffic com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
missioners to publish details of all applications for road service licences received by them. Such publication is, in my contention, necessary to enable appropriate representations or objections to be made in the prescribed manner and thus to be available for consideration by traffic commissioners in accordance with a statutory duty laid down in the Bill. The statutory duty to which I refer is that outlined in clause 5(3)(	<i>c</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>'any objections or representations made to the commissioners in the prescribed manner which in their opinion are relevant"</p></blockquote>
have to be considered by the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come to the argument about whether that is the best way in which to lay the obligations on the commissioners on a later amendment, but for the purpose of this amendment I want to assume that the Committee is agreed that the commissioners will be under an obligation to consider representations made to them in a prescribed manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "prescribed manner" used here has a precise legal connotation. It would be better if the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us what that connotation is, rather than that I should do it. The effect of the amendment, coupled with that part of the clause to which I referred, is controlled by the meaning of those words. Presumably if the objections were made in a way other than in the "prescribed manner" it would be arguable that there was not the same obligation upon the commissioners to consider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the considerations leading to the amendment, which deals with the way in which the commissioner examines various representations made to him when he is carrying out his duty of considering applications for licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating this amendment together with amendment No. 105. The amendment is clear. We believe it is important that the commissioner publishes these proposals. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that other bodies or persons affected by the action, namely that proposed in amendment No. 77, are offered an opportunity to submit any objections or representations which they may consider appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we are not on contentious ground as to intention. I hope that the Minister will confirm early in his contribution that people affected by proposals put
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
to traffic commissioners in the course of applications for licences should be made aware of that and therefore be better able to make their own submissions to traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the Minister nodding, so I shall not develop that part of the argument. It is common ground between the Minister and myself that that is desirable. Among the people who should know about this are the general public likely to benefit or to be disadvantaged by the granting or refusal to grant certain licences, the local authorities involved in transport planning, the operators and the trade unions whose members are employed on some of these services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has been to Tyne and Wear recently will know only too well that when proposals are made for certain types of new transport services, those who will be employed on such services take a considerable interest and make pointed representations. I contend that all those people are affected by this, and that therefore we should lay the duty to publish fairly and squarely at the point at which it is appropriate, namely, when the commissioner is due to consider representations. That should be done in good time. Those who are affected should be able to example in precise terms what the proposal is in relation to the road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also be assured, as is the aim of amendment No. 105, that no action will be taken by the commissioner which will have any bearing on the subsequent granting or refusal of a road service licence until the proposal has been published. There is, therefore, the question of intention to inform and also the question of the correct procedure or time scale of consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this will not be a controversial issue. I am sure that the intention is right and completely proper in the context of the Bill. If one accepts the principle that the information should be available to other interested parties in the form in which it is available to the commissioner, it would be quite wrong for the commissioner to be allowed to go ahead and do anything whatever until such times as others had also been able to examine the information and to make representations to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that, contrary to the evidence on all previous attempts to be helpful in this way, the amendment will
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
evoke a favourable response from the Minister. We may then proceed to what I regard as the more controversial aspects of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Minister of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has raised an important point on which we would seek to meet him. Clearly, the publication of applications is vital to the working of the licensing system. It is in no way our intention to do away with that. I accept most of the points that he has made. I think that we are at one in our belief that publication is a matter not just of importance but of necessity in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements for publication of applications for road service licences are at present set out in regulations made under the Road Traffic Act 1960. These regulations require the traffic commissioners to publish notices of all road service licence applications that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can give the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee a firm undertaking that this requirement to publish will be maintained in whatever revised regulations we lay before the House in due course. We would expect to lay these regulations during the next few months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that firm undertaking in response to the right hon. Gentleman—clearly, what I have said applies also to amendment No. 105—I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is shocking us. I make no complaint. I thank him very much. That means that a number of our arguments will not have to be deployed. I am somewhat stunned by the Minister's acceptance of what seemed to be a simple amendment. However, perhaps I might press the Minister to go a little further. It is a sensible amendment, in line with others that we have put down. Once again it came from the Opposition. There were no murmurs from the other side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard my hon. Friend say that the Minister had accepted the amendment. Is he quite sure that that is so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that I would have been corrected if it were not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I said—and I said it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
twice—was this. As these questions are dealt with in regulations—they are not, and have not been, dealt with in the main body of transport legislation, either in this Bill or in the 1978 Act—I undertook that we would bring forward regulations which would meet the points about which the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends were concerned. I should have thought that that was as far as the right hon. Gentleman would wish me to go. If there is any further undertaking that I can give to make the position clear, I shall certainly seek to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that that was a fairly firm commitment. The Minister was quite unequivocal in saying that the principle was a very good one. Nevertheless, as he will be reflecting on how to put this into the Bill, presumably on Report or at some other stage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clarify the position for my own satisfaction. I presume—I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman agrees—that other regulations are to be introduced. The fact that there are other regulations governing the activities of the traffic commissioners is not immediately clear from clause 5. It must arise from other, principal legislation. If we are to consider generally the work of the traffic commissioners, it should be made clear now from what principal legislation the other regulations are derived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand a number of the questions asked by the hon. Gentleman. But perhaps the Minister will give an explanation or interpretation when he replies to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I simply wished to make one simple point. We are all now in favour of more open Government, and recognise that such information should be published—whether it concerns trade unions or other organisations, as my right hon. Friend remarked, The Opposition have one basic concern, and we have spelt it out here, although there is general recognition that provision was already made in the body of regulations under other legislation. We have considerably changed, and are in the process of changing further, the whole area of licence considerations by the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is vital that the information
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
on applications before the commissioners is more than simply published. What would happen should a commissioner publish the information under previous regulations? For example, if company A has applied for a licence, the commissioner may publish the fact that he has received an application. The Minister has made clear that that is what happens at present, the commissioner does publish the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there has been a false sense of security. A number of people have felt that their interests can be defended by the definition of public interest—the considerations that the commissioner had to take into account in assessing the application. It may well be that it is not sufficient for the information simply to be published. I wonder what efforts are made to ensure that such publications go to bodies which would have a legitimate interest in them, and which in the past may have relied on the previous criteria to defend their position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Take the example of a district bus company wondering what is the position on applications. A later part of the Bill says that the commissioner will have an obligation to consult councils, but that does not apply to a number of transport undertakings operated by district authorities. There are a number of examples—the Minister, I am sure, is well aware of them—of district authorities operating bus undertakings under the umbrella of the county council. They could not be assumed to have received any information about such an application, which would directly affect the transport authority under which they were operating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Minister has agreed that the information should be published, will he enlighten the Committee whether further steps will be taken to ensure that those bodies which will not automatically be consulted will have access to the information? It is also important to the district authorities, because people in an area may have the opportunity to learn what is happening only through their district authority being informed. We shall debate that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister encourage us to feel that not only will information about matters under consideration by the commissioner be published but that the commissioner will be under an obligation to circulate some details of applications? I hope that the Committee will forgive my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
ignorance—that may already be the case. I do not know for sure. The Minister makes clear by his statement that it is his intention to ensure in some way that applications for licences are published. Will he tell us how such information will be circulated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's assurance, and was encouraged by his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that, if there is to be greater competition in transport, that competition is based on the maximum information being available about what applications are being made. If we are to have competition, we should all be able to see the shape of the game and what services are being offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister answer another question? He has said that it is desirable that the information should be made available. He undertook to ensure that that would be done by regulation—indeed such information is already available, although the provisions still have to be tidied up. He did not say whether there would be any disadvantages in accepting our amendment. I am not a lawyer and I do not wish to upset the apple cart, but why can the amendment not be included? It would strengthen what is fundamentally an exercise in open government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The traffic commissioners are often accused—sometimes rightly—of being close with their information on certain subjects. While I accept the Minister's assurances, if a duty for them to publish information is categorically stated in clause 5(1), we shall then have it in black and white, and black and white can be read. The whole framework would be strengthened. Will the Minister address himself to that point in his reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add to the arguments put by my hon. Friends since the Minister spoke. We cannot overemphasise the importance of publicity in this area, particularly if the clause goes through unamended. The most important aspect of the clause is the transfer of the onus of proof from the operator having to prove that it is in the public interest that he obtains a licence to the traffic commissioners having to prove that it is in the public interest that he does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That makes it vital that publicity is given to every application in a way that does not
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
prevail under the existing law. The traffic commissioners will have to consider, in a sense more carefully than they have in the past, what is or is not in the public interest. It is therefore imperative that the public and organisations representing sections of the public—various pressure groups, ratepayers' organisations, trade unions or anyone else—have the opportunity to make their views and interests as part of the general public known to the traffic commissioners. Only in that way will the commissioners be able to give proper consideration to the question of what is or is not in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the case under the existing law, because it is up to the applicant for a licence to show that he is acting in the public interest. He is therefore well geared to adducing all sorts of evidence and arguments in favour of the application. In future the applicant will not have to adduce any arguments in favour of his application other than the fact that he wishes to apply. He may add to that if he wishes to make doubly sure that his application succeeds, but it will be up to the traffic commissioners to find reasons why a certain application may not be in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is vital to the whole concept of clause 5 that the public are informed, forewarned and given the opportunity to make representations. The traffic commissioners sitting in their offices—I was going to say ivory towers, but that would be unfair on some—will not be in a position to make a proper adjudication on what is in the public interest unless they are open to a great deal of representation from the public. Without an obligation to publish the fact that an application has been received and its details, they will not get a public response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) will say concerning the Minister's request that he should withdraw the amendment and be satisfied with the assurance that the requirement for publicity will be included in regulations. I put it to the Committee that the whole question of publishing and publicity at that stage in the process of licence application is of such significance, and is so fundamental, that it would be better for us to include it in the substantive legislation rather than leave it to regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While there are other obligations on the traffic commissioners to operate in certain ways, to hand out some types of informa-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
tion and to make other information available on application—and no doubt we shall ensure that they publish other facts—it seems to me that the matter is basic to the concept of proper adjudication on the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reverting to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), I should also like to hear from the Minister, before we decide about withdrawing the amendment, who the Government envisage will be informed of applications under the regulations. Certainly, without a very wide net being used, I should be reluctant to accept the suggestion that regulations would suffice in this crucial aspect of clause 5. I add for good measure that it is crucial only because of the change that the Government are introducing in respect of the onus of proof. Frankly, I do not support that change, but those who do must, in all logic, also attribute great weight and importance to the question of publicising the receipt of applications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the proposition that, if possible, we should include in the Bill a requirement to publish. I welcome the Minister's commitment to provide regulations, and I entirely accept and agree that publication is intrinsic to this aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, despite my right hon. Friend's commitment on regulations, I am always a little cynical about such matters as regulations, the likelihood of their being laid before Parliament, affirmative and negative procedures and so on. As this is such an important part of the Bill, it seems to me that, unless there are good reasons for not including the amendment it should be accepted, and I shall be glad to hear what my right hon. Friend has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify whether the regulations will ensure that the requirements of traffic commissioners will be standard in each area, as there are no safeguards in this respect in the Bill at present? Presumably, with the repeal of sections 132 to 140 of the Road Traffic Act 1960, the traffic commissioners will be free to decide what form an application will take and what information is required. That could vary considerably from area to area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When taken in conjunction with clause 4(3) of the Bill which refers to the fact that a:
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"road service licence is required for each traffic area"</p></blockquote>
and clauses 6 and 7 which deal with conditions attached to road service licences, it can be seen that the Bill, far from simplifying the application for, and granting of, road service licences, could lead to unnecessary complications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has helped the Committee by making it clear that there is no argument between us about the importance of publishing the details contained in applications for road service licences. However, he has sought to persuade us that we should not include in the Bill a requirement that those details should be published—that such a duty should not be laid on the commissioners—but that we should leave it to the Minister of Transport of the day to make a regulation which would have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that the Minister made that suggestion on the basis that he could use the amended section 160 of the Road Traffic Act 1960. Therefore we are in difficulty, first, because we are asked to accept that a section of an existing Act that will be amended by the Bill should be used for that purpose. I do not make too much of that, because I take the assurance that section 160 will be amended only in so far as that is necessary to deal with the different licensing procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.0 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why I am not happy about that matter—as well as about that which was most adequately outlined concerning the desirability of having the proposition in the Bill anyway—is that section 160 of the Road Traffic Act is what I call a schizophrenic section. It appears to try to do two things that are completely contrary and to be intended to give a Minister the most sweeping powers. It says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"regulations may be made under this Part of this Act . . . for prescribing anything which may be prescribed under this Part of this Act".</p></blockquote>
That gives tremendous power to make regulations. However, the section later tries to be extremely specific about the purposes for which the Minister may make regulations. It states that he may make regulations in respect of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the badges to be worn by drivers and conductors of public service vehicles".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am aware that in law a badge may be a publication. Never-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
theless, I believe that the right hon. Gentleman is straying from the amendment. He requires a particular thing to be published—namely, an application. I do not think that the publication of badges is relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. English. I chose rather a bad example from section 160. However, I was not seeking to make the point that the matter concerned just a power to control publication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am talking not about that power but about the right hon. Gentleman's amendment, which requires the publication of a particular thing. That happens not to be a badge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to explain. One of the ways in which the objective of the amendment could be met—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I mean, and what the right hon. Gentleman is doing. There are many ways in which the objective of the amendment could be met, but only one way in which the amendment itself can be met, which is by passing it. I am sorry, but I am not interested in other ways in which the objective could be met, nor—within the rules of order—is the Committee. We are interested in the right hon. Gentleman's argument for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not I who raised the issue of section 160, but the Minister. I believe he suggested that the amendment to which I am addressing myself is not necessary because of the existence of that section. If he did not say that, I take it that he will intervene to correct me. Therefore I am arguing that a regulation-making power in the Road Traffic Act 1960, which on the one hand is very sweeping, and on the other is very specific, is not an argument against the amendment and I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a good argument against the amendment, because acceptance of the amendment would not prevent the Minister from exercising that power. If the amendment required commissioners to publish these details, and if it was accepted the Minister could still go ahead and make a regulation to lay down the way in which the commissioners should publish, I believe that that would be a highly desirable
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
development, because there can be some argument about what is an adequate publication of these particulars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems perfectly clear that with amendment No. 86 we are discussing the desirability of a requirement to publish being included in the Bill. The debate has shown that it is highly desirable that people should know about these applications, and that the best way for them to know is to lay upon the commissioners a requirement to publish. Therefore, the existence of the regulating power is interesting and relevant and I do not believe that the Minister would have drawn our attention to that had it not been so, but it does not invalidate the desirability of putting the power within the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendment that we are discussing, to which the Minister has not yet turned his mind, is amendment No. 105, which is coupled with this amendment for the purpose of discussion. It deals with the slightly different issue of traffic commissioners attaching conditions or varying those conditions. That stems from clause 6(3), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The traffic commissioners by whom a road service licence was granted may at any time while it is in force vary the licence".</p></blockquote>
I am concerned about when they vary the licence by attaching to it an additional condition as they think fit, having regard to the various interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested by amendment No. 105 that those who are affected by a variation of the road service licence conditions should be informed of that, and I believe that the remainder of the argument follows from that. After being informed they will have an opportunity to make their representations. I also wish to apply a similar argument to that which I applied to amendment No. 86, which is the desirability of the commissioner listening to those representations before he decides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have two issues. First, there is the desirability of laying that down in the Bill. That is in no way to imply any lack of good faith on the part of the Minister. I am certain that it is his intention to seek to meet the point by publishing a regulation. I believe that he can still do so if amendment No. 86 is accepted. In fact, I believe that that will be made very clear if he supports the amendment. We also await with interest the Minister's views on amendment No. 105 which we are debating with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister spoke I was very impressed. For a second I thought that the good common sense and practicalities that have been exuding from the Opposition Benches for so long had started to register. Yet what did the Minister say? When discussing the amendment he seemed to imply that he had accepted something without saying that the amendment would be part of the Bill. In effect he said "I recognise what you are saying, but leave it to me". I believe that the credibility of that argument would be appropriate if the Minister would now rise and say "I accept the amendment". Basically, if one says "I accept the amendment, but leave it to me", one can dispense with the words "but leave it to me" and simply say "I accept the amendment". That is what is talked about in amendment No. 86, which reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall be published by them".</p></blockquote>
Government Members have made great noises about open government, and their chance to prove that has arrived, because accepting the amendment with the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall be published by them"</p></blockquote>
instead of "Leave it to the Minister who will put it in" would be a great advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good the Minister accepting amendment No. 86 if he does not also accept amendment No. 105, because it makes nonsense to use the words of amendment No. 86
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall be published by them"</p></blockquote>
if one does not go on to use the words of amendment No. 105
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that no such action is taken without the proposal being published by them",</p></blockquote>
because it is nonsense just to publish. The teeth of the amendments are not in amendment No. 86 but in amendment No. 105, because having published, the whole exercise of publishing is valid only if one then says that no action shall be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was most heartened when the Minister first spoke and I thought that a ray of light was at last appearing and that here was a good thing. If the Minister accepts amendment No. 86, as he appeared to do with the words "Leave it to me", would not it be much easier if he accepted both amendments? With the greatest respect to the Minister, I suggest that he cannot accept amendment No. 86 without putting
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
in the teeth that are in amendment No. 105. I suggest that it would be nonsense simply to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall be published by them"</p></blockquote>
because the whole purpose of publishing is so that people may see. The crux of the matter is found in amendment No. 105 which says that, having published
	<br><blockquote><p>"no such action is taken without the proposal being published".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, having published, no action will be taken. It would be published, it would be read, people could make something of it so I wish that the Minister would put the credibility of his side on the line by saying "Do not leave it to me—I will accept both amendments because both make sense."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he accepts what we say I would have my faith in his credibility restored, because it is no good for the Minister to say to the Opposition Benches "I accept what you say but I am not putting that in the Bill." If the Minister accepts what we say, why not put that in the Bill for everyone to see?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To answer the hon. Gentleman and other right hon. and hon. Gentlemen directly on that point, the reason that we have not put that in the Bill is that since 1934—I believe that is the right year—that has been done in regulation. The hon. Gentleman was right when he referred to section 160 of the 1960 Act, but there are also regulation-making powers under section 158 of that same Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg hon. Gentlemen to take on board that, so far as I can see, the Committee is absolutely united on this particular point. There is no division between us on publication. We all say that we want publication and the only matter of division appears to be whether that requirement should go into the Bill, or whether it should be left to be dealt with by regulation in the way that it has been dealt with for the last half century. Not only has that been successfully dealt with in that way, but, so far as I am aware, without any major complaint from any quarter that that has led to a removal of or non-provision of information to the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that we should want to make only necessary changes and in that respect we would be best advised to leave well alone. I must also say that if we are to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
start writing extra clauses into the Bill—which, goodness knows, is already long enough—this is probably not the only clause that will have to be reviewed in this way and we shall end with a much larger Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rest my case on the undertaking that I gave and which I believed was satisfactory. Certainly, it was aimed to meet virtually every point made by Opposition Members. The power in the two sections of the 1960 Act remains and the commissioners will continue to publish road service licence applications in their publication notices and proceedings. That automatically goes to the councils concerned. It goes as a matter of course to the Greater London Council, to county and district councils, to regional councils, and to highland or district councils in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has never, in my experience, been a major complaint that this system has not worked well. It has been seen to work well. I again urge my hon. Friends and the Committee that this is a proven system and that we all speak as one on this principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards amendment No. 105, the details of the publication of suitable matter will continue to be left to regulations, the existing regulation-making powers will be used and the industry and the local authority will be consulted. I certainly give the Committee the undertaking that we shall retain existing regulations which ensure that all major parties are informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, what Opposition Members are saying is true. This is a regulation-making power; it is recourse to regulation making which can be prayed against and debated in this House. It is not that the Minister of Transport is simply laying it down and that is the end of the matter. It is certainly not. It is how it has been done for almost 50 years. It has worked satisfactorily so far and I give as firm an undertaking as I can that we intend to continue with the system, proven as it is, and to ensure, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brighouse and Spenborough clearly suggested, that the public are properly informed. With those assurances, I hope that Opposition Members will think it proper to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Gilroy Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise with some
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
trepidation because no master of Committee constitutional procedures am I. I am a mere apprentice but in this room I could be considered to be a sorcerer's apprentice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always been at the pointed end in local government. My background has been to implement legislation that has been passed in Parliament. As chairman of the City of Birmingham Transport Committee, I implemented legislation. As chairman of the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority I implemented—though I disagreed with it initially—the implications of the Transport Act 1968. We did not operate section 20 of the Act—the powers to disestablish the commissioners and give their powers to local authorities. We accepted the powers of the traffic commissioners. Suddenly I found myself transferred to this place, to take part in the Committee debate on the formulation of legislation which will have effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in the West Midlands are proud of our tradition. I still serve on that council and the transport committee of which lately I was chairman. We and other metropolitan counties are concerned about clause 5. The phrase "having regard to" concerns us and must be relevant to the amendments. It is felt that "having regard to" does not define carefully enough. Some metropolitan counties feel that it ought to be replaced by a direction such as "must".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will see that it does not quite fall within the terms of the amendment. I understand what he is trying to say and it would better if it were said on "clause stand part" rather than in relation to this narrow amendment, which says that the commissioners should "publish".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly stand by your direction, Mr. English. I was saying that although concern is expressed by metropolitan and other authorities about this kind of provision, I feel sure that we would accept my right hon. Friend's indication and confirmation that it will be dealt with by regulation which can then be translated and accepted by the authorities. It would foreshorten the debate if I could give that indication to metropolitan county councils—my own in particular—rather than wait for a further amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another opportunity will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
arise for the hon. Gentleman on amendment No. 75 and the considerable number of amendments to be discussed with it. Mr. Dobson.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not clear whether the Minister's proposed course of action as an alternative to including the two amendments in the Bill covers the second amendment, in particular the phrase "Provided that no such action is taken".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point raised by my hon. Friend, there is considerable doubt about whether the regulation-making power referred to by the Minister, whilst unquestionably allowing him to publish a regulation which would require the publication of information, also gives him power to stop the commissioner acting upon the application before representations are made. Even if that were so and the power is there, a different issue is raised by amendment No. 105. There we are dealing with the commissioner initiating a change in the condition of licence, and I should like to be assured about whether there is a specific power to stop the commissioner going ahead and doing just that without carrying through the publication requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that we would not be relying entirely upon his assurance to lay regulations. He went on to say that the matter could be pursued in the House as the regulation could be prayed against. I have looked at the two sections of the 1960 Act—and we have to read the Bill as part of the 1960 Act under the provisions of clause 1. Sections 158 and 160 appear to be controlled by regulation for the purposes of part IV in the supplementary section 215. I cannot see anything in that section which provides for the negative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there may be something in the Road Traffic Act 1960 which I have not noticed which would in fact require the negative resolution procedure. I should be grateful if the Minister would refer me to it if it is part of his argument against acceptance. But he has not by any means convinced the Committee that there will be any harm at all in requiring publication, or, for that matter, any harm in requiring the commissioner who is to vary the conditions of the licence to publish and consider the amendments first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Minister owes the Committee a further explanation of how he sees
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
the control of the issue and how, given the nature of his objection to the amendments, they could be expected to be accepted, knowing full well that we are agreed upon aims—at least in relation to the first amendment. We have nothing to suggest that the aim of the second amendment is considered wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. PAUL DEAN 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter of some concern which authorities can be given the information. The Minister made it quite clear that he was prepared to see that with all the authorities which received this information in the past, the normal procedure would be pursued, and we welcomed that. In saying that, I may be wrong, but he made it clear when he itemised the authorities which are listed in clause 5(4)—the Greater London Council, county councils, and in Scotland, regional and islands councils. He did mention district councils, but there has been considerable concern as to whether district councils that have been running transport authorities will in fact be consulted in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A quick example in my area is that in the case of Hull the district council runs the transport authority and while the money of the transport supplementary grant may be given to the county authority it does not guarantee to give it to the district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister will be well aware of this problem, and I am only asking whether the Minister meant to include—I hope he did—that such information will be given to the district councils as well as the county councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are approaching the point when the Committee must decide whether it regards the assurances that I have given on this point as sufficient. But I shall answer two of the direct points which have been put to me by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) asked me if it applied to district councils—the answer to that is, yes, it would apply to district councils. I can certainly give that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second major point which the right hon. Gentleman raised was whether the regulation order which was made would be subject to the negative resolution. The answer to that again is, yes, it would. Section 215, to which he referred, was in fact repealed by section 205 of the Road
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
Traffic Act, 1972. The negative procedure requirement is under section 260(3) of the 1960 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I go back, Mr. Dean, to the point that I made. The Committee is at one, I believe—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quoted the specific point as to whether the aspect in amendment No. 105 was—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 105 would be by publication or by notification to other operators or to local authorities or to whoever it might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, Mr. Dean, that on this issue there is almost nothing between the two sides of the Committee. I believe that we have sought to help the Opposition as much as we conceivably can. If the Opposition wish to continue with their point, that is a matter for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is so much between us. The problem is that if the Minister can satisfy us that the regulation he will make takes in amendment No. 105, where the regulation will say that no action will be taken until it is published, I do not think that there is much between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 105 entails, as I have already said, a requirement for publication or for notification. That would be part of the regulation and I have already given an undertaking on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the Opposition that there is nothing between us on this. The regulation-making power has worked well and effectively and I believe that, given that situation, the Committee should reject the amendment if it is to be pressed in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be reluctant to have this matter voted down, because we have established completely the validity of the point. I am considering whether I might seek leave to withdraw, but it is rather difficult, as you will appreciate, Mr. Dean, to face a Minister who, on the one hand, argues that things have worked well for 50 years and should be left alone, and, on the other hand, has as the major justification for his Bill that the practices that have stood for 50 years are outdated and inadequate. He tells us that in fact this particular power that he has been talking about was changed as recently as 1972 to make it subject to some sort of control by
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not want this amendment to be voted down, as I hope that there will be time for further reflection on the matter. I think that the aim of both the amendments is perfectly reasonable and they could easily be included within the Bill and would not impinge in any way whatsoever on the Minister's power to make the regulations in the form which he has assured us that he would wish to do. Of course, his assurances presumably do not count for his successors in this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is a highly unsatisfactory point at which to leave it, and I hope that I have made it very clear to the Committee, on my own behalf and that of my hon. Friends, that we are leaving this only because we do not want a Committee decision against the principle of including it in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the fans make a noise I shall try to raise my voice above them. Subject to the howl of the fans not being such as to sweep my papers from the desk in front of me, I think that the wind of change blowing through the Committee can only be for our good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group of amendments to which we now turn start with amendments No. 82 and 83. To save the time of the Committee and in an effort to expedite our proceedings, I should like to deal with them together. I do not wish to draw any distinction between them. If I could propose them as a single amendment I would propose;
	<br><blockquote><p>"clause 5, page 6, line 36 leave out 'to' and 'they' ".</p></blockquote>
Here is an opportunity for the Minister to reduce the length of his Bill and to meet at least one of the concerns which he voiced on the debate on the last amendment. As far as I can see, it would make not one jot of difference to the meaning of the Bill. It will change a line—page 6, line 6—which at present reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a road licence is made to the traffic commissioners, they"—</p></blockquote>
so that it will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a road licence made, the traffic commissioners".</p></blockquote>
The sense of it would be that where an application for the grant of a road service licence is made, "the traffic commissioners shall". It seems to me to be the perfectly straightforward use of the English language and cuts out a couple of words. It meets the Minister's concern about the length of the Bill. It is altogether and wholly admirable, and I hope that it will not be the cause of any row in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what has happened on previous amendments and previous clauses I cannot give my hon. Friends any assurance of that. It seems that this should be one of the most innocuous and uncontroversial pair of amendments ever tabled by any Opposition, and one of the easiest for any Minister to accept. As I say, that does not guarantee that the Minister will accept it. We wait with bated breath to see whether that is the case, but we shall not hear that, I assume, until I have at least deployed to the Committee the reasoning behind amendments No. 84 and 85.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am so anxious to proceed I shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
deploy the arguments briefly and come back to the merits, if that is necessary, in the light of the Minister's reply. Amendment No. 84 which applies to clause 5, page 6, line 37, deals with that part which refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"such a licence on the application".</p></blockquote>
Again, I think that the long wording is unnecessary, and again, the amendment is an attempt to save words by inserting a phrase which, in the context of the Bill, has exactly the same meaning. I have read this a number of times and I cannot change the first conclusion that I reached, that the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such a licence on the application"</p></blockquote>
in this context means "the licence". Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) provides that the traffic commissioners:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall grant such a licence on the application unless they are satisfied that to do so would be against the interests of the public".</p></blockquote>
That must mean that the commissioners shall grant a licence unless they are satisfied that to do so would be against the interests of the public. There is no way, in the total context of the clause, that the licence referred to can be anything other than the licence which is the subject of the application. That seems to be the only intelligent and intelligible interpretation that can be put upon it. I therefore believe that this is another case in which we can get rid of unnecessary words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 85 deals with a similar point in paragraph (	<i>b</i>). Again, we seek to omit the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"such a licence on the application"</p></blockquote>
and to insert "the licence".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are therefore drafting amendments in respect of subsection 2 (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) and I think that they are complementary. I do not think that they change the meaning, certainly not in any harmful way. They ensure that the clause is drafted in somewhat simpler English whilst achieving what I understand to be the Minister's purpose. If that is not so, I have no doubt that the Minister will tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly a consensus feeling is now developing—not before time—in the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to press my luck too far. It has been pressed upon me by my hon. Friends that all I need to do now is to ask the Minister whether he is accepting this batch of amendments. I think we may assume that he will back amendment No. 47, but I do not think that we can assume anything further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that we have convinced the Minister that there is no evil intent behind many of our amendments. I hope that he has accepted that in a number of them we are trying to improve the Bill, while in others we are seeking to change the meaning of the Bill. I can promise him that we shall always make it clear which it is that we are trying to do. I very much welcome the oasis in the desert represented by some of our amendments being accepted. We have come a fair way through the Bill since the last time that happened, but the wind of change is no doubt doing us all good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to what is a complex, detailed and interrelated set of amendments affecting clauses 5, 6 and 10 of the Bill. I shall, therefore, seek first to go through the mechanics of the amendments rather than dwell at length on their merits. In any case, I understand that a number of my hon. Friends are deeply concerned about the merits. Here we are not necessarily seeking to reproduce the Government's aim in a neater set of words. In some instances, we are clearly trying to alter the role of the commissioners as proposed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 75 seeks to add two items to those already specified in clause 5(3)(	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>c</i>), namely:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>aa</i>) the interrelationship of the proposed new service with any existing service and the likely effect of each on the viability of the other;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>ab</i>) road safety".</p></blockquote>
The inclusion of those two items is clearly designed to widen the interpretation of the phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the interests of the public"</p></blockquote>
by requiring the traffic commissioners, in addition to the matters already specified, to have regard to the possible effect of new services upon other services and upon road safety when considering whether the granting of such a licence is in the public interest. According to the terms of the Bill the decision to grant or refuse a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0375">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
licence would have to be made subject to the application before the commissioners or subject to the application and such appropriate conditions as they have power to attach to it under the provisions of clause 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the proposed additional paragraph (	<i>aa</i>), I believe that it is essential, in the interests of the travelling public, that, when considering an application for a road service licence, the commissioners should be required to have regard not only to the needs of those members of the public residing on or very close to the route of the proposed new service, but to the needs of the public in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing new about this. The Minister has told us that certain things have worked well for 50 years in road transport and passenger transport legislation. This has developed considerably in the course of our legislation over a long time and has, I think, redounded to the general benefit of the travelling public. To achieve some improvement on certain routes at the expense of general detriment to the travelling public of the area would therefore be a sad mistake. Those who enjoy services as a result of the benefits of cross-subsidisation within a network of services may well find those benefits placed at risk if, in considering an application for a new road service licence, the commissioners are prevented from considering the effect of granting such a licence upon other services in the area. That is the basis of amendment No. 75. Clearly the merits and ramifications of that are considerable and we shall wish to deal with them in some depth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 76 also touches upon the criteria which traffic commissioners will use. By leaving out the phrase "by those authorities" in clause 5 (3) (	<i>b</i>), it impinges upon the traffic commissioners' criteria. In deciding whether it is desirable for traffic commissioners to have regard to the transport policies and plans of the county councils in England and Wales, consideration should be given to the special situation which has arisen in recent years. Certainly, the situation did not arise from the 1930 legislation. It has developed in post-war years. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr Marshall) drew my attention this afternoon to the views of the Strathclyde authority in this respect. The way in which the road traffic commissioners grant licences is one of the factors which,
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
coupled with others—some of which are within the purview of the Minister of Transport—affect the bus network in a particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not difficult to imagine a number of situations where it would be in the public interest for traffic commissioners to be required to have regard to these transport policies or plans when they are brought to their notice by public transport operators or others. Presumably, the local authorities concerned have not seen fit to do so. As the Bill is drafted, I take it that the traffic commissioner has to have regard to the plans only if the local authority concerned draws them to his attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that in nine cases out of 10, when the traffic commissioner is about to take a decision which may conflict with the local authority transport plan for the area, the local authority will draw that plan to his attention. There is no guarantee of that happening. What is more, the maintenance or the action in accordance with the plan or against the plan is not a matter which affects only the local authority; it affects the public and the people who are operating services in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I hope that this matter will not prove controversial. I hope that we carry the Minister of Transport with us. These authorities are very concerned about the extent to which they can sensibly plan for bus networks, having in mind the changes in legislation which are proposed here and the difficult negotiations which they will inevitably have with Ministers of Transport about the extent to which the plans they make are feasible, given the amount of public money available to support them—whether that money comes from the rates or from taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These issues are of such importance that they should not only be considered by traffic commissioners if the authorities concerned are drawing attention to them. Other people should be allowed to do so, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next amendment is a Government amendment. I had a look at the definition in the 1960 Act of the terminology used here as to the prescribed manner. I was confirmed in my suspicion that it has a very precise meaning. I assume that the Minister will tell us whether his intention is to prevent a distinction between "objections" and "other representations", or whether he is concerned about the manner in which regulations were prescribed for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
dealing with objections and representations, and whether he wants to prescribe in regulations for them always to be dealt with in an identical manner. From a lay reading of the amendment, that seems to be what it covers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right, I ask the Minister whether the same effect would be achieved by defining "representations" in the definition clause of the Bill as covering "objections." If objections and representations are both to be dealt with in the same way, and if when he makes regulations he wants to specify that commissioners must deal with representations and objections in the same way as one another, would it be better to make clear in the definition clause that objections and representations are the same for the purpose of this clause? In that way he would oversome the difficulty which his amendment seeks to remove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that there is such a complex relationship between this series of points which, in some instances, are highly detailed and, in others, are very sweeping. But there is an inter-relationship in the Bill between clauses 5, 6 and 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendment No. 77. This amendment seeks to specify those persons or bodies to whose objections or representations the traffic commissioners will be required to have regard when considering subsection (3), namely, the question of the interest of the public in relation to the application for a road service licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an inherent contradiction in this part of clause 5. It says that the traffic commissioners shall have particular regard to certain bodies, but includes in the list of those bodies:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any objections or representations made to the commissioners in the prescribed manner."</p></blockquote>
In my view, one of two things can be done here, but not both. If the commissioners are to be required to have particular regard to certain bodies or to certain people, those people can be specified. But people in general cannot be included in the list of people, which is what the clause as drafted appears to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that the amendment may be open to a not dissimilar objection, but at least it makes clear that the chief officer of police in the district has a right to make the objections or representations to which the commissioners have to have particular regard. It specifies:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any of the local authorities concerned."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
Here what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) is relevant, in that district councils are mentioned in subsection (5) (	<i>b</i>), and we want them to be mentioned in this paragraph, too. It makes clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"any district council, any London borough council and the Common Council of the City of London"</p></blockquote>
would be able to make representations to which the commissioners should have specific regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, the amendment specifies
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person who is already providing passenger road transport facilities along or near to the route or any part of it"</p></blockquote>
which was affected or covered by the road service licence. It in no way cuts across the Minister's aim, because sub-paragraph (v) corresponds to his subsection (3) (	<i>c</i>) in allowing "any other persons" to make the objections or representations, provided they are considered to be relevant at the time by the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, of course, one can see the distinction. It is one thing to tell the commissioners that they must have regard to the chief of police or to the local authority. It is another thing—perfectly compatible and logical—to say that if they get any other objections or representations they have to consider them if they regard them as relevant. That distinction will be readily appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It implies, of course, that the commissioners may not consider what the police say is relevant, but they will still have to take into account that they might consider—although I doubt whether they would be so undiplomatic as to say so—that representations of some of the other people specified were not relevant, but they would still have to take them into account. I take it that that is the meaning of that part of the Bill. We have tried to reproduce in the amendment the general cover part of the clause which allows the traffic commissioner to take into account representations and objections from other people if he considers them to be relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next of the amendments in the group, No. 78, is consequential on amendment No. 77. It would eliminate the duplication that would be involved if we were to specify all the persons and bodies again. I do not think there is any need to deploy the argument. It is merely a simplification of the wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 106 raises a consequential effect and would, I hope, avoid dupli-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
cation. Similarly amendment No. 107 is a consequential amendment to clause 10(3) (	<i>b</i>). I should point out that the responsibilities of the commissioners run to the revocation or suspension of the road traffic licence, as well as to the granting of the original licence and the attaching of conditions. Therefore there is a link between clause 10 and clause 5. We suggest that the considerations that apply to the granting of road service licences, to the factors which commissioners take into account and the bodies or persons to whom they have particular regard are equally appropriate to revocation or suspension of the road service licence. Some might argue that in the interests of certain operators who risk having their road service licence suspended or revoked it is even more important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made an attempt, albeit an imperfect attempt, to explain what I see as the basic purpose and aim behind the amendments. No doubt my hon. Friends will want to argue the merits and the applications to their own geographical areas and areas of concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 75. It is a crucial amendment, because it goes to the heart of the clause. In fact I think the amendment is one of the most relevant and crucial that we have discussed so far, because quite a number of matters relate to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) was right to underline the substantial importance of what the amendment attempts to say. I regret that the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) is not present, because there is an important argument here about cross-subsidisation. I have read what he has said on the principle of cross-subsidisation. He indicated that he would like to expand on the subject if he had a chance and I am sorry he is not here, for I certainly would have been glad to hear him. What he has to say will be of great interest to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes to the heart of the economic principle of bus licensing and operation and is important in that respect. Secondly, it encompasses the social consequences of the decisions that will be made about the framework of applications and related criteria. The importance of the amendment was underlined by my right hon. Friend. It touches on two principles—first, economic and secondly, social and those two are interrelated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enormous damage will be done to services, particularly in rural areas and especially in Suffolk, which I know best, unless the interrelation of one service with another is taken into account. The long-standing principle is that profitable routes finance the unprofitable services. I shall give the Committee an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the weekend I had a consultation with a major bus operator in Suffolk. He thinks that the principle of cross-subsidisation is crucial to the whole framework of his services. Like many bus operators, he makes a profit on some services and uses that to subsidise others. There are some remote places in Suffolk and if services are cut off, those places will be totally isolated. That operator has services running to places with names such as "Thurston Woodyard", "Daisy Green" and the "Norton Dog" public house. See the world with Mulleys coaches—I shall give my operator a free commercial as part of my constituency service. He has another service to the "Live and Let Live", which is the principle underlying the Bill. "Punch Bowl Corner" is another destination. He assures me that when some of his passengers have read the Bill they will not emerge from the "Live and Let Live" at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am trying to make the point that these services are in remote rural areas of Suffolk and will collapse if the principle of cross-subsidisation is fractured. That will have calamitous consequences for parts of the area of Suffolk that I know best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the things that have emerged, and it has not exactly taken me by surprise, is that although I thought at the start that the principal sides of the divide were the national operators on the one hand—connected with the National Bus Company—and private operators on the other, that is not so. Often those who are part of the status quo and seek to benefit from it, are the private operators. So there is in some cases a holy alliance—or an unholy alliance—between substantial private operators who are already in the game, if I may put it like that, and the National Bus Company, against other private operators who are seeking to establish new services. The argument is not as simple as it appears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are arguing about those who profit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
from the status quo, and are holding their cards close to their chest, and those who do not. It is every bit as much an argument of one private operator against another as it is of the national operator against a private operator. The consequences of that will be more complex than they seem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree wholeheartedly that interrelation of services is an important point of principle and should therefore be laid down categorically in the clause. It is not stated strongly enough. No doubt the Minister will say that the interrelation of one service with another is already to be understood from subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>), which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the transport requirements of the area as a whole (including so much as is relevant not only of the commissioners' own traffic area but also of adjoining traffic areas) and of particular communities in the area".</p></blockquote>
One could argue that paragraph (	<i>a</i>) refers in principle to the interrelation of services. But does it? I should be glad of the Minister's assurance that it does, but I think that the Opposition will take much more convincing that the interrelation of services has been accepted by the Minister in the spirit in which I have put it forward. It is not good enough that the interrelation of services, which is so important for rural areas such as those in my constituency, should be left to be vaguely inferred from subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 76. In my view, the Minister should accept that amendment, and I hope that he will. It is not critical. It seeks to delete the words "by those authorities". Subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any transport policies or plans which have been made by the local authorities concerned and have been drawn to the commissioners' attention by those authorities".</p></blockquote>
Presumably we are to infer that the only people who can draw the commissioners' attention to TPPs and to what local authorities have to say are the local authorities themselves? If the Minister is fair-minded, I think that he must agree that that is much too restrictive. In Suffolk, for example, many people read the TPPs. They are the subject of public discussion, and there is a good deal of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should not anyone who reads the TPP documents and the local authorities' rolling plans draw the commissioners' attention to anything that is in those plans? The amendment is important, but the Government would not give anything
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>
away politically by accepting it. I think that they ought to stretch a point on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a difference of opinion with my right hon. Friend about amendment No. 77. I see what he is driving at, and I appreciate the importance of what he says, but paragraph (	<i>c</i>)—without all the gilt about who can make representations, and without all the detail—reads in the Bill:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any objections or representations made to the commissioners in the prescribed manner which in their opinion are relevant".</p></blockquote>
That leaves the matter much more flexible. I think that my right hon. Friend, in trying to be cautious and to ensure that people's democratic rights are not excluded, is trying to tie the matter down too closely. Although I shall be guided by him, perhaps he will think about leaving subsection (3)(	<i>c</i>) as it is, because it has the flexibility for all sorts of people to make representations and perhaps it makes good sense as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask my hon. Friend to consider that, if paragraph (	<i>c</i>) is left in its present relationship to paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), without specifying those bodies listed in amendment No. 77, would be open to the commissioner to say, in the event of an appeal against him, "I do not have to take account of the considerations put to me by this objector unless I consider them relevant. I do not consider them relevant. Therefore, I do not have to take them into account". He will stand pat on the wording of what would then be an Act of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, under our amendment that argument would not be open to the commissioner on an appeal and in the appeal hearing, he would at least have to show why he rejected certain representations or objections made by the important bodies listed in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I had not thought of that point. Perhaps the Minister will reply to it, because I had not considered its full implications. I shall think some more about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To sum up, the crucial amendment in the group is No. 75. It goes to the heart of the principle and I think that we are coming to the sort of discussion and debate which we should have. What emerges from our debate on this amendment will be crucial for the future of bus licensing and the whole transport framework in rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) that amendment No. 75 is the crucial one of the group. I agree with him that it states clearly the important question of principle raised by the clause and, indeed, by the Bill. It is such an important point of principle that, in direct contrast to the hon. Gentleman's argument, I believe it imperative that it is not incorporated in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, without wishing to embarrass the hon. Gentleman, may I say how much we welcome the great clarity and greater brevity which he brings to his speeches, since these have not been noteworthy characteristics of speeches from Opposition Members. When he took us on a tour of the pubs in his constituency, we were beginning almost to enjoy the prospect that he would invite us for a drink at any moment, when, for once, he would have commanded unanimity in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment gets to the heart of the matter and I believe that the clause is vital. It is important that the Bill should state clearly that in future the traffic commissioners are to presume in favour of the applicant. That is a clear statement and in direct contrast with past law, under which the presumption was always in favour of the existing operator. It was difficult—indeed well nigh impossible—for a new applicant to get permission to operate a stage carriage. In future the traffic commissioner will be instructed clearly by Parliament that he must make a presumption in favour of the applicant. If he is to reject a new service, he has to be satisfied that it would be against the public interest. That is a clear statement of intent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past the network and cross-subsidisation arguments have been deployed by existing operators to prevent new services starting. That is where the difference of principle and philosophy clearly arises between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we incorporated an amendment directing the traffic commissioners to take into account of the interrelationship with other services, we should be back where we started. The intention of Parliament would certainly be muddied considerably and I suspect that the traffic commissioners would not know how to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention is clear at present and it should remain so. That does not mean to say that the traffic commissioners cannot take into account the effect on the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
area. As the hon. Member for Ipswich pointed out, they are directed to take into account the TPPs that are brought to their attention—that is another point—and the transport requirements of the area as a whole, but it is vital that the traffic commissioners in future should be able to judge the application on the merits of that service on its own and not have the issue blurred by the larger argument of cross-subsidisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that I am totally against cross-subsidisation as a matter of principle. But it is a matter of practice. Many commercial organisations cross-subsidise from one section of the business to another. It is a clear and common sense commercial activity, but the problem arises with bus services, where it has not been commercial or clear. The net result of cross-subsidisation has been an overall reduction of bus services with a net dis-benefit to the public generally through declining bus services, a disenchantment with public transport and a turning away from it. That is the result of our present system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If in future the traffic commissioner has to presume in favour of the new service, I believe that he or she—I presume that there can be female traffic commissioners—will be following what is surely the common sense position of the man in the street—the man on the Clapham omnibus might be a more appropriate analogy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man in the street will assume that, on balance, it must make sense to encourage more bus services on any route and not to discourage them, and that is what Parliament will be saying if the Bill goes through in its present form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman but can he give the Committee a projection?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One cannot say "will". The hon. Member knows what has happened to public transport over the years. None of us can gaze into the crystal ball with such certainty as to say that it will produce
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>689</span>
more public transport services. All that one can do is create an atmosphere, a framework, and hope that it will stimulate better public transport services. Certainly the present structure has produced a continuing decline in the services for a variety of reasons, including, I believe, the licensing framework that has existed. All that one can do is to hope. I believe that we will succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put to the hon. Gentleman a strong reason for not instructing the traffic commissioners to take into account the cross-subsidisation argument, the interrelationship with other routes, but making clear that he has to judge that particular route on its merits. Cross-subsidisation has often not been simply a question of the redeployment of money—it has not simply been a case of one profitable route supporting an unprofitable route. The cross-subsidisation has taken the form of a redeployment of resources—in other words, the bus company, because of its general social obligation, has taken buses and scarce employees and deployed them on the unprofitable routes instead of using them on the profitable routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The net result has been fewer buses, inadequate services and higher fares on the good routes, along with a general disenchantment with the bus services among the general public. If, as the Opposition fear, the bus company redeploys those extra buses on the profitable routes, what will happen? We shall get a situation where there are better bus services on the good routes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not on the other routes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To the extent that they are profitable. That is the motivation for directing the buses there—and the public will actually be travelling more on those buses, which is what the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More buses in London would not help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More buses on the profitable routes, better services and more public on those routes. The net result—it is happening in other parts of the country—is that if poorer areas are deprived of bus services, the community at large has to make a clear social decision about whether or not it will make a grant to subsidise these services.
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about a net increase in the number of buses serving the public, but it is important to make a clear social decision about loss-making services and decide whether or not to finance them. That is happening in my constituency and in many other rural areas where the community, through the council together with private or public bus companies, makes a joint decision to operate a loss-making route. The net result—the hon. Gentleman's own logic should lead him to this conclusion—is more buses on the better routes and a clear community decision to operate loss-making services in other areas. The net result should be better services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we blur that situation, which the Opposition amendment would do, we shall be going downhill with the continuing decline in bus services that we have seen in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clear intention of Parliament, as expressed in the clause, should not be blurred in any way. It could produce a considerable advantage to the travelling public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that it is a sound economic proposition to identify services with cost, and if they are unprofitable services let us have it out in the daylight and let the community do something about it. I understand that. That is an orthodox free enterprise argument. However, I put it to the hon. Gentleman that those on the profitable routes would take the commercial surplus, which is a profit on those routes, and leave the community to finance the rest. What we are saying is that one should take the good with the bad.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is saying that he resents the fact that some people on the profitable routes will make a profit and is prepared to see a general decline in bus services in order to deprive certain profitable organisations of the chance to make money, I say that he has his priorities wrong. If, indeed, there is such a lot of profit to be made from stage carriage operations, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, I say "Fine, let us attract people in to make those profits and the net result
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>
should be better services".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I followed the hon. Gentleman's argument with great interest. He always produces fascinating arguments, although I do not always agree with them. The hon. Gentleman said that the result of the application of the principle of cross-subsidisation is that scarce resources are deployed in such a way as to make services on what would be profitable routes not as good as they could be, because those resources—I think that he itemised vehicles and employees—were being used to provide services on routes which were not profitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the hon. Gentleman said that that was also part of the cross-subsidisation. He went on to say that if we do not apply this principle we shall start using scarce resources—buses and employees—to a greater extent on the profitable routes—I think that he called them "good" routes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also said that the community would take a decision to provide, with a grant, services on the unprofitable routes that had their buses removed. How would that help to obtain more of these scarce resources of vehicles and employees?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. This is a fundamental question. It is significant that the Opposition amendment has produced a debate, which should mean that we no longer need a clause stand part debate and that we have already got to the heart of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the very scarcity of resources that has been generated by the system under which we have been operating. By denying profit on profitable routes we have dried up the flow of resources that would otherwise become available. I am not saying that this is a panacea. No panacea will suddenly produce more buses. But the logic of the argument of the Opposition is that there will be more buses on the profitable routes. Society then has to decide what to do about the other areas which, for social reasons, many of us believe need bus services. That will require a subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that it will not cost more in the end because the net result of what we have at present is that society is subsidising many routes that should be profitable but are not. We end up by paying grants right across the board. For many
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
areas the net result has been loss-making services which in future might be profitable services. It is my belief that this philosophy is the right one, and we shall end up with a better deal for the travelling public, a better deal for the bus operators generally, and for the taxpayer. The Opposition amendment would blur this. The Government have taken the right decision in this respect and I hope that in no way will this very clear intention of Parliament, this clear instruction to the traffic commissioners, be blurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although that might rightly be described as a fundamentalist contribution, I am not sure that the distinction between the amendments is as clear as the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) suggests. In considering
	<br><blockquote><p>"the transport requirements of the area as a whole",</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"any transport policies and plans"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"any objections or other representations"</p></blockquote>
—if we accept the Minister's proposed amendment—it seems likely that to some extent the traffic commissioners will be obliged to take into consideration the interrelationship of the proposed new service with any existing service and the likely effect of each on the viability of the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore to suggest, as the hon. Member for Faversham has done, that to include this amendment would change the nature of the clause and consequently the heart of the Bill, is going rather too far. What we are saying is that we should like it spelt out because to some extent Acts are indicative to people who have to operate them. We should like spelt out to applicants for new licences, to the traffic commissioners, and, perhaps most important of all, to those persons and organisations who may be invited to comment on applications, the considerations that will have to be borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to the Opposition that this question of the interrelationship of routes is vital to the consideration and the concept of whether the application is against the interests of the public. Many who are consulted will argue that this question of interrelationship is directly related to whether the interests of the public are being served. Therefore, in some senses,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
the speech of the hon. Member for Faversham is almost irrelevant. We are trying slightly to strengthen the provision in subsection (3). We are not seeking in this amendment fundamentally to change subsection (3) and consequently fundamentally to change the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth noting the party affiliation of two organisations which have some responsibility for transport—the Association of District Councils, which although slightly bipartisan, certainly it is always under the control of the Conservative Party, and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities which is presently under the control of the Conservative interests. Perhaps I should declare an interest here as one of the innumerable vice-presidents of the AMA. Certainly the AMA has made it quite clear that it supports an amendment on the lines of amendment No. 75 so that there is clear consideration by the traffic commissioners of the question of the interrelationship of routes and consequently the concept of cross-subsidisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The AMA would have liked the Bill to go further to make sure that the traffic commissioners also considered the likely effect of granting the licence on the planned returns—that is, the financial returns—from past major investments of public resources and integrated public transport systems and the cost of operating those systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister winds up the discussions on this clause, I should like him to say whether it is true that the consideration raised by the AMA will be a legitimate consideration for the traffic commissioners when considering a new licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the basic question of cross-subsidisation. It is because it gives a bit of meat to any discussion when we talk about practicalities and realities that I think it worth reporting that the National Union of Railwaymen has received representations from its members working on bus services in Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Hampshire, Derbyshire and Northumberland about the number of services that may have to be withdrawn, curtailed or reduced as a result of the elimination of substantial cross-subsidisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be of interest to the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale) to know that the Newquay, St. Austell and
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
Plymouth branches of the NUR are firmly of the opinion that there will be substantial cuts in bus services in North Cornwall as a result of the proposals in the Bill. They point out that it might be worth while approaching the residents of North Cornwall, especially those from Wadebridge to Bude to ask what happens when Western National review its services in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told by them, and I have no reason to believe that it is untrue, that immediately following the withdrawal of Western National there was a rush by private operators to fill the gaps. That is very laudable. It fits in entirely with the principle of the Bill. The only trouble is that one by one they have dropped out, and the area is now devoid of all but the bare minimum of public transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Neale</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that in North Cornwall the great majority of services are provided by private enterprise? He might care to look at one case operated from Bude. Were it not for the length of time that the Opposition have taken to discuss these amendments I would have had the letter before me at this moment. I had it earlier today. An operator from Bude, running services to Exeter, replacing a service such as those to which the hon. Member referred, has moved the figures in passenger terms from something in excess of 30,000 a year to about 150,000 a year. He may care to reflect more carefully when he states figures about Cornwall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to stand corrected and learn that public transport is prospering. But I should like to ask the hon. Member for Cornwall, North whether it is not a fact that, following the withdrawal of Western National services in North Cornwall, there was an immediate ingress of private operators and that the number of services provided by those operators since Western National gave up, has suffered a severe reduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the hon. Gentleman will want to consult people in his constituency or look up further letters from the famous man from Bude—famed in song and limerick, no doubt—I trust that he will be able to consider that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a matter to which we have referred previously. I do not know whether my hon. Friend is aware that the bus operators, when challenged about this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
point—which was made during the Second Reading of the Bill—made a clear distinction between the number of services and the number of people carried on buses. For example, one could have one service a week, which is two services, but if the other operator was operating the same route with 10 buses a day, there would still be twice as many services, but the man operating the first bus could be considered as carrying a lot more passengers. It is a matter of definition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had better move on from North Cornwall and give the hon. Member for Cornwall North, time to consider his position—as they might say in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move now from the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, where there is almost an evenness of political spread in control, to the representations made by the Association of District Councils, which overwhelmingly represents the interests of the Tory party. Its document says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the viability of a network"</p></blockquote>
—not the service but a network—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is not considered there could be creaming off of the traffic from the lucrative routes, thereby undermining the rest of the system."</p></blockquote>
I am certainly prepared to go along with that, because it seems logical that that would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to the deletion, which seems to be a minor one, by way of amendment No. 76, which is simply to leave out the words "by those authorities". In an era when there is an increasing amount of litigation over such matters, we should not put operators or the traffic commissioners in the position where someone can say "We know that the traffic commissioners considered transport policies and plans made by local authorities, but as they were not drawn to the attention of the commissioner by those authorities"—as would be required in this part of the clause—"they were not entitled to consider them." Local authorities, like human beings are fallible. Indeed, many local authorities are rather more fallible than most human beings, and it could happen in certain circumstances that a local authority failed by accident—or even by design—to draw the traffic commissioners attention to its policies and plans. Nevertheless the policies and plans might be drawn to the commissioner's attention by a local pressure group or the police or some other body, and because of
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
these three words in the Bill—which are quite superfluous—the courts might rule that they were not a legitimate consideration for the traffic commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hasten to assure the hon. Gentleman that the clause is not capable of any such construction. Anybody can draw published policies or plans to the attention of the commissioners under (	<i>c</i>). The words "by those authorities" are not meant to exclude other people making reference to the transport authority's plans. They simply recognise the particular role of the transport authorities in bringing their own plans up to date, and the special voice that they have before the commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to accept that reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move now to amendment No. 77, which seems to me as important as any that we have yet considered. I refer to the question of who must be consulted, or whose representations must be considered. That seems to me a vital point. In particular, there is the important requirement in the amendment proposed by my right hon. Friend to the effect that the representations of any district council and, in London, any London borough, must be considered in the same way as the representations of the counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that throughout a considerable part of the country the bus operators are district councils. So, in Humberside a situation could arise where the council was being consulted, and specifically selected by the law to be consulted, whereas the Hull city council, which operates the buses in Hull, was not being consulted. There seems no logical reason, therefore, why the Minister cannot accept this amendment. To be honest, I cannot see that any of the proposed amendments are contrary to the general spirit of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth noting again that both the Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the Association of District Councils are keen to ensure full involvement of district councils. That is one of the reasons for our pressing this list of changes, so that it will be abundantly clear to all concerned that district councils are to be involved. Besides those which have the responsibility for providing a transport
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>697</span>
service, there are innumerable district councils which have made considerable and useful studies of the transport problems of their area. Even excluding those who run services, those who do not run services have, in many cases, given a great deal of thought to the transport problems of their areas. It seems right that they should be given the same status and consideration as anyone else in the process of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that it is in order to quote from the notes on clauses. They are just documents like any other. Paragraph 15 of the notes, dealing with clause 5, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The reference to transport policies and plans is drawn in general terms and does not refer only to the Public Transport Plans which English and Welsh shire counties are required to produce by section 2 of the Transport Act 1978."</p></blockquote>
In contrast, paragraph 18, when listing the councils which are to be consulted directly, and specified in the Bill, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These are the councils on whom statutory public transport planning duties are laid."</p></blockquote>
It seems illogical to say that the general idea is that it should be general transport policies and plans and then, later, to say that those on whom certain statutory duties are laid will be specified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that it would be right and proper, and would ensure full consultation of the consequences of the clause, if the extension of the specified categories of people and organisations who should be consulted is included in the Bill. Consequently, they also should be those who are informed and given the appropriate details when a licence is issued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the Minister is apparently unwilling to accept all the amendments proposed by my right hon. Friend, because none of them destroys the heart of clause 5. Indeed, it could be said that, generally, the amendments proposed by my right hon. Friend are wholly in accordance with the spirit of the clause and are intended simply to clarify matters and make them altogether more straightforward. Therefore, I commend all the amendments and hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will save us all a great deal of time by accepting them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 77 enumerates some of the bodies with which consultation could take place. It is a long amendment, especially compared with
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
Government amendment No. 47 which simply states "after 'or', insert 'other'." That would mean the clause would be reworded, "any objections or other representations".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition amendment is by no means exhaustive. Why should not there be representations from the users' consultative committee and other concerned bodies, such as trade unions, the CBI or ad hoc meetings with citizens? One could go on to make several pages of additions and finish up with a Yellow Pages directory of those to be consulted—estate agents, the National Union of Railwaymen, the Law Society, the Transport and General Workers Union, Select Committees or all-party committees of the House of Commons, and so on. However, instead of that, the Government's sensible proposal is that in paragraph (	<i>c</i>) the word "or" is inserted after "other", which is right and proper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in our debate I pointed out that I had disagreed with the intentions and implications of the 1968 Transport Act and gave my original fears about its operation. Nevertheless, in the West Midlands it become my lot to implement that Act, first as chairman of a passenger transport authority, and, secondly, as chairman of the transport committee for that area. However, in the end I found that the way in which the Act was interpreted and operated was eminently satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, it is interesting that no Minister of Transport has ever implemented section 20 of that Act, which would take the powers to adjudicate on fare levels from the traffic commissioners. Matters have been left as they are and that is probably right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put forward those points unashamedly on behalf of the West Midlands—I am still a member of its transport committee— and the AM A, of which the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) and I share the vice-presidency, because of the fears that arose, which can be summarised. Phraseology such as "should have regard to the best interests of the public" give rise to worries. All that the traffic commissioner is asked to do is to have regard to those interests. There is no compunction or imperative placed on him. He must simply give consideration to the matter. Many feel that the provision should be more definite and dogmatic, and that it should include the word "must".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard from one of my hon. Friends
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0385">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
that in future the presumption will always be in favour of the appellant. Another subject of concern is the dictates of the 1968 Act, which gave all authorities instructions to produce plans for integrating all forms of public transport—I signed such a plan for the West Midlands in 1973 and chaired its implementation—and to rationalise bus operations. So no fewer than 22 plans for rationalising bus operations throughout the whole West Midlands area—including Wolverhampton, West Bromwich, Sandwell, Birmingham, Coventry and Solihull—have been three-quarters completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have undertaken to rationalise all forms of transport. We have built four new railway stations, including Birmingham International, on the cross-city line. Stations were refurbished, and the line added to its transport capability by 3,500 per cent. in terms of passengers carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another fear is that if the presumption lies with the appellant and an entrepreneur asks to operate a service that by-passes the railway station into which we have re-rationalised the bus route, under the present set of instructions to the traffic commissioners, what will happen to the residual and original transport system created under the 1968 Act? Therefore we fear that wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also concern about the interests of the public. Those will be adjudicated by the traffic commissioner, who is not elected. I understand that traffic commissioner administration comes under the Master of the Rolls. There is the possibility of a formula to give the commissioner a tight set of rules by which matters can be adjudicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this non-elected gentleman, who makes no financial contribution to transport, as do county and district councils and the taxpayer, has to make decisions that had previously been arrived at under statute by elected people—Members of Parliament, county councillors, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I base what I have to say on the knowledge of decisions made by traffic commissioners that were directly against the interests of those county councils which framed plans and that were deleterious to transport operations. I ask that parameters be given on decision-making, and that what has to be considered be set out clearly. I do not think that that can be covered by resolution, but in the traffic commissioner we have an appointment
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
that is undemocratic and unaccountable, and which could override the views of elected persons. Unless that formula is precise, that could damage some of the achievements that have been made under the 1968 Act in particular, under the 1978 Act, and under all those acts that have been implemented by local authorities throughout this country and have helped the public cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all interested in hearing what is said by the hon. Gentleman, who has a clear and considerable experience of PTAs and the transport system. He spoke of the disadvantage felt by the PTA arising out of the decisions of the commissioners. Will he tell the Committee whether that was largely in relation to fares or whether other disadvantages resulted from the commissioners' decisions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a perfectly fair question. There were other matters, but it was particularly a matter of fares, even though that body, after the fare increases had been implemented—and increases made under my administration were substantially less than those made under the previous administration which was not of my colour—still retained the fare structure as one of the lowest in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a classic case of the traffic commissioner taking decisions which, to put it mildly, were dubious. We are worried about the widening of the commissioners' powers, and not about their restriction. I am certain that it is feasible for the Minister to present regulations that will deal with these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Power is total here. As has been said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely".</p></blockquote>
The traffic commissioner is given total discretion under subsection (3)(	<i>c</i>). I do not object to the forward-looking objectives of the Bill, but I feel that we can arrive at a clear format of clear directives that will ensure that all the strategic plans and the PTPs that have been ratified by the Government and councils will continue in a way that is not injurious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is one clause in the Bill that emphasises the difference between the two sides of the Committee, it is clause 5. I do not always agree with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>
hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), but I always listen to him with interest, and he made a case that is fundamental to that difference and relevant to the amendment. The hon. Gentleman made the case that the lucrative parts of transport would attract the private sector. He said that all of the people who, under the Bill, would be able to move in would move into that lucrative area. He added that it would be a conscious decision of the community as to how the other services were run and whether they would be subsidised by the county council, or whatever it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That expresses the fundamental difference between the two sides of the Committee. We say that the profit from the lucrative runs should be used to subsidise those lines that will not make a profit, but the hon. Gentleman says that the profit from the lucrative areas should go to private individuals, after which the community can make up their minds. Does that mean the taxpayer? That is the difference between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed amendment No. 48—I use that example very loosely, Mr. Dean, because I do not want to transgress—great emphasis was placed on the public interest. I submit to the Committee that the public interest does not lie in putting profit into the hands of private individuals at the expense of rural lines. The basic argument of the hon. Member for Faversham was "Let private enterprise have the lucrative lines and take out the profit, and the communities in the rural areas can make up their minds about how they will suffer".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), to which I listened with great interest. I have a small piece of advice for my hon. Friend, which I hope he will take in the proper manner. He mentioned a scenic tour of Suffolk which was very interesting and not confined to pubs and spoke of a place called Live and Let Live. May I ask him to go to Ipswich,
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
following the probable passage of the Bill, and do that place a great service by renaming it Live and Let Die, because without doubt that will prove to be the result of the Bill. Under the clause, about which the hon. Member for Faversham spoke, all those who could be running services to Live and Let Live will be on the lucrative lines and there will be no Live and Let Live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a previous clause—this highlights our difference—we debated the difference between a 30-mile limit and a 50-mile limit. I believe that the figure that I quoted for the National Bus Company was of £5£ million at risk. Again, that demonstrates the fundamental difference between us. A proportion of the £5½ million at risk is at present utilised to cross-subsidise services which without that amount of money would not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the amendment seeks is to say that in the interests of the public, which the Minister has put in the Bill, the traffic commissioners shall look not only at the proposed new services in isolation—which basically is what the Government are saying—but also at existing services, with a view to the viability of both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the Government intend what could well be a by-product of Bill, but it does nothing whatever for the transport system of the country to hive off those parts that are most profitable. Undoubtedly those parts will make a profit, but, under the Bill, that profit will go to private hands and not to serve the interests of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does nothing to solve that problem to say that those areas where private individuals have moved in are now making a profit, if at the end of the day networks across the country have been destroyed which depended for their existence on the fact that large networks make a profit out of lucrative runs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
