	<p>4.35 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 337, in page 44, line 31, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided that such determination shall be made within one month of the coming into force of this Act and that the persons administering the scheme shall have the option within one month after the making of such determination of repaying to the Minister any money deemed to be money paid in advance under section 43(1).".</p></blockquote>
Under sub-section (2) financial arrangements are deemed to come into force on 1 April 1980. This could be said to be retrospective legislation as the Bill will not then be an Act, but this is a provision which is working in advance of the Bill's becoming an Act. However, that is not the aspect with which the amendment deals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause appears to recognise that certain existing financial arrangements will have to continue until the Bill becomes an Act, and certain payments that are due under present legislation will still have to be made. But under the clause as worded, those payments, instead of being currently provided for in legislation, will be deemed to be loans made to the pension schemes which receive them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) gives the Minister the power to determine the rate of interest to be paid on those moneys. As far as I can see, there is no right of anyone who is in receipt of those moneys to object to whatever rate of interest the Minister shall deem fit for them to pay. That is altogether a strange financial arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trustees of some of the funds will be told that moneys to which they were entitled under a funding provision made by Parliament are no longer provided for that purpose. They will be deemed by the Bill to be converted to loans, and the trustees will be required to pay such interest rates as the Minister may determine. In the light of all that, the proposal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2076</span>
in the amendment is modest. It would merely allow those deemed to be in receipt of loans at an interest rate determined by the Minister on the Bill's becoming an Act to have an option to pay back the loans and thus get rid of the obligation to pay the interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The need for that limited degree of protection will arise if the interest rate being charged by the Minister is higher than the rate at which the pension scheme can invest its money. In that case it would be a straight loss to the pension schemes to have to continue to hold the money paid to them under preceding legislation. Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell me whether I am reading aright the provisions of the clause? Can he also tell me what justification there can be for requiring the trustees of various pension funds to hold moneys paid to them beyond the time when the Bill is enacted, and to pay the Minister a rate of interest that is in excess of what they can receive by investing pension funds?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that he might be inclined to be generous with provision of public money here—something which is quite uncharacteristic of other Ministers in this Government. If that is so, the option to continue may be a useful arrangement. But if it is intended that the Minister should be completely free to fix the rate wherever he wishes, with no right of appeal or objection, it is most important that there is at least this limited protection, so that the loss to the fund of paying the higher interest rate would not be carried on beyond the time when the Bill is enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill gives the Minister the sole right to determine the appropriate rate of interest on these payments, and to make clear that the payments will be any that are made in the next financial year under the 1974 Act funding arrangements. It is the intention of the Bill that it should come into effect before the next financial year begins. Until Royal Assent, various payments that were intended for funding will have to be made. That problem is dealt with by treating any payments made after 1 April 1980 as loans towards the pensions' emerging cost obligations of the next financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they are treated as advance payments, it is right that they should be subject to some interest. As the Bill stands, the Minister can determine whatever figure he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2077</span>
thinks is right. That is the legal position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with a couple of other points that arose during our discussion on pensions, I hope that it will not be regarded from a reading of the strict legal provision of the Bill that the Government are intending to take an extremely high-handed, unfair and unrealistic view of such things—in this case, interest rates—without reference to fund managers. Although it is correct that the Minister could, on the face of it, apparently, take a perverse view of prevailing interest rates and so on, that is not, in practice, how he intends to go about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is already contact between the Government and the fund managers about a number of points, including the appropriate rate of interest that should be charged on the advance payments. We hope to carry this through to some kind of understanding or agreement with them. Only if there is a failure to agree—and we can never guarantee agreement—will the Minister use his powers. In so doing, he will seek to exact a fair and appropriate rate of interest, not one which disregards prevailing rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion being put to the board by our officials is that these advance payments might be treated as tantamount to a loan, and that the interest rate should therefore be determined by the interest rate for the National Loans Fund up to one year current at 1 April 1980. That seems sensible. We look forward to the board's response, and if fund managers consider it inappropriate, no doubt they will come back with what they consider an appropriate analogy and try to dissuade us from that view. They may, of course, accept that these should be treated as loans for any other purpose, and that it is an appropriate way of fixing interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope to charge the rate of interest that a pension fund in this position would expect to have to pay if it obtained loans in the market, given the ordinary position of a pension fund. We are open to considering any argument that might seek to persuade us of an appropriate interest rate on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment, which seeks to put a time limit of one month on determining the interest rate. I hope that it will not be longer. With luck, it might be possible to achieve a position where we can determine the rate in much less than a month, but I would rather retain flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a more important objection to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2078</span>
the amendment. One of the provisions it seeks is that the fund managers would have the option, within one month, of repaying the Minister any money deemed to be money paid in advance, presumably interest-free. These are substantial sums, and I could not contemplate allowing fund managers to have approximately £40 million of public money for one month, interest-free. Prudent pensions fund managers would keep their £40 million for one month and ensure that they made the maximum possible use of the option. We would all like to have one month's free use of £40 million of public money. But it is not a provision to which anyone could seriously expect the Government to agree. Any rate of interest determined would have to apply to the full period within which the board has had advance payments of moneys.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary's response raises a number of difficult points. It is the job of Parliament to be vigilant in examining Bills to see whether the principles on which they are based and the powers sought by Ministers under them are reasonable. On any reasonable basis, the Government must regard themselves as under an obligation to go on making the funding payments required under present legislation until this Bill becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause makes it clear that the Government do not propose that. They are asking Parliament to approve of a change in the financial provision, under our present legislation, in respect of these railway pension funds, which will start to take effect as from 1 April 1980. So I do not necessarily contend that the Minister's powers are to be called to account only because he may impose a high interest rate. The Minister is seeking retrospective legislation to enable him to convert the existing statutory obligation to a loan as from 1 April 1980 until the Bill becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, if I read subsection (5) aright, the interest is paid in respect of any payment after 1 April. So it is not a matter of being able to exercise an option to pay off the loan and therefore to avoid the liability to pay interest. I assume that the working of the amendment would not take effect until the Bill became an Act. Therefore, the option could be exercised only then. So I assume that there may be cases in which a pension fund management body
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2079</span>
has had money paid to it. It will be deemed to have received a loan under the provision of the clause, and those pension fund managers will be liable to pay interest on it over the period for which it has been deemed to be a loan, that is, from the time they receive it until the Bill becomes an Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is not correct, that is a different matter, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will make that clear. In that case, the scope of the amendment would be much narrower. If the fund managers will be liable to pay interest over the whole period over which they are deemed to have a loan, surely the latter part of the amendment is not unreasonable. When the Bill becomes an Act, they should, surely, have the right to say that they do not want the money on that basis, because they never applied for it on that basis and do not want to continue paying the rate of interest, if it is higher than that obtained from other investments. From that point on, this provision of money becomes a sheer liability to those who have to administer pension funds. It seems, therefore, that that point stands in its own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of whether the determination should be made within a month of the Act coming into force can be debated. But it is not necessarily fair for the Parliamentary Secretary to assume from that the pension fund managers are trying to evade a reasonable obligation. As soon as there is a legal basis for this way of changing their funding, they must have a right to exercise a judgment. Surely, Parliament will not impose upon managers a duty to have a loan at an interest rate which is detrimental to their fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Parliamentary Secretary can meet us, certainly on the latter point. If the period of one month is worrying him, there may be some scope for agreement. It would be unreasonable if, beyond the point which he is trying to cover—leaving aside the retrospective element—the Bill were used as a means of forcing fund managers to have a loan which they had not sought, at an interest rate unfavourable to the management of their fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman did not press his point about retrospective legislation and I do not think that the Bill comes into that category, which is always regarded suspiciously by Parliament. It is not a question of changing the law from what it was believed to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2080</span>
before the Bill was introduced, or reversing a legal judgment, or anything of that kind. There are plenty of examples on the statute book of tax changes and other policy changes which take effect from the date of the announcement. We are talking here about a date—1 April 1980—which we have not yet reached and, if we make good progress, we shall finish the Committee Stage and perhaps all stages in the House before that date is reached. The right hon. Gentleman does not press that point in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Bill as it stands is that the Minister will be empowered to determine a rate of interest, and that interest will be payable from the date when the money is paid, not from the date of Royal Assent. Any interest rate charged will be on the full extent of the payments which are deemed to be advance payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the right hon. Gentleman has a point when he says that the fund managers have not asked to have these loans, if that is what they are, wished upon them. It is a slightly embarrassing obligation, and I hope in my reply earlier I made it clear that we certainly do not wish as a Government to impose any penalty on pension funds arising out of the unwished-for largesse of an advance payment of about £40 million. On the other hand, we cannot contemplate varying the arrangements so much that the pension fund managers find that they are entitled to the interest-free use of £40 million for a period even as short as a month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we hope to reach some understanding which does not impose a penalty upon them. I have already suggested one way, which is either to take an appropriate National Loans Fund rate or, if that is not acceptable, some interest rate which is the equivalent to that which the pension fund would expect to pay in the market for a loan. I am just canvassing another possibility, given that they do not want the loan in the first place. It is possible that the funds could be placed on deposit in a mutually agreed way, perhaps with the National Loans Fund itself. In that case they would never really leave the public purse. A zero rate of interest would then be appropriate. That would in effect dispense with this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the amendment is not necessary. One feature is positively undesirable and unacceptable to the Government. However, we are anxious to come to a conclusion, and we are open to any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2081</span>
suggestions that the board has, and we are making suggestions for a conclusion which does not impose any penalty on the board. I have canvassed one or two suggestions today, and I do not think that there should be any difficulty in coming to an understanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are making progress on this matter. However, I take objection to talking of the money as "largesse". I cannot see that there will be many pension fund managers who will not want the money to which they are entitled under the funding arrangements. They will need that, and they will need an appreciable amount of time in which to make the alternative funding arrangements which they will now obviously make. It is not a question of large sums of money that will be an embarrassment to them. It is highly desirable that there should be an option at the appropriate time only because of the interest rate. If an agreement is reached on what is a reasonable amount of interest to charge on these moneys, which will by then have been converted by an Act of Parliament from a funding entitlement into a Government loan in anticipation of payment for another purpose, that may well be the best way out of* this dilemma. So I should like to consider further what the Parliamentary Secretary said on the issue and his assurances about the ways in which it might be done, and possibly return to the point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has accepted that there will be a difficult period for a number of fund trustees. They will have to change the basis of operation from providing total funding arrangements for the various funds to one in which a proportion of the fund will be covered by funding and another by pay-as-you-go. In those circumstances many of their existing investment arrangements will be totally inappropriate and they will need time to put them right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a favourable interest rate arrangement is reached I would not want to stand in its way. If it were felt that it would be better to give more time than having to hand back all the money to avoid the payment of interest, as far as I can see that would be one way of easing what by any standards will be a massive problem. In the light of that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment is intended to clarify the clause and to ensure that proper support payments are made for the schemes listed. It is not clear to the Opposition that that will be the case. As we have explained before, it is not just a matter of getting the Bill right. A number of people are affected by the pension schemes and are—believe it or not—taking a close interest in our proceedings although I cannot imagine how they keep awake when reading the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not sure that, as drafted, the Bill provides proper support for the schemes. The Parliamentary Secretary may say that it does, and if so that is all well
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2083</span>
and good. If not, we wish to pursue the matter to make sure that essential support payments are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue raised by the amendment relates to those relevant pension obligations which consist of guarantees by the board to certain pension funds. They fall into two broad categories —the guarantee in respect of the capital value of certain investments by the funds, and that concerning the interest from those investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This might best be explained with a couple of simple examples. The board might guarantee in certain circumstances that if a stock has to be sold below its book value by those operating the fund the board would make up the difference. Another would be that of the board's guaranteeing that if the interest received in a particular year from some investments were less than 4 per cent. the board would make up the income to that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) said, there is doubt about whether the Bill adequately permits Government support to be given to cover those liabilities. The amendment is designed to achieve that effect. In fairness to the Parliamentary Secretary, I must say that this may not look like a very neat way of doing something which is relatively straightforward and narrow in its aim. But it spells out precisely the schemes where doubts arise and says exactly what the Government's obligation would be in respect of the relevant pension obligations. Therefore I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is unnecessary. As it stands the Bill provides for the board's obligations, under guarantees of interest and capital, to be eligible for support. But I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman first on his understanding of the amendment and, second, because he appears to have uncovered a small field of technical defects which I shall have to undertake to correct by Government amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two schemes with guarantees in respect of capital of the sort just described by the right hon. Gentleman. There is also a small technical defect. When the board guarantees the capital
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2084</span>
value of a fund's assets, that will remain even though it has been taken into account in calculating the unfunded proportion of the fund. The fund could therefore still call on the board to make good the loss on sale of the assets the value of which is guaranteed. He would be prepared to consider making a technical amendment on Report to the effect that the Minister's payment should be taken as being the satisfaction of the board's liability under guarantees of capital of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other even more important matter that the hon. Gentleman has uncovered is two pension schemes that are not even listed in schedule 8 and of the existence of which we were totally unaware. One is the Great Eastern Railway new pension supplemental fund. When examining that we find that, thank heavens, it is covered by one of the trust funds that were mentioned earlier—the Great Eastern Railway new pension fund and new pension (supplemental) fund joint trust account. That enables us all to give a sigh of relief and realise that the interests of those Great Eastern railwaymen are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there is the equally important issue of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway enginemen and motormen's pension fund society. The reason that we had not discovered it is that apparently it is administered from Wandsworth Common station and not from the board's corporate pensions department. No doubt there is an elderly and bewhiskered gentleman somewhere on Wandsworth Common station— probably in one of the waiting rooms— looking after the interests of the South Eastern and Chatham retired motormen, and it is important that the board's guarantees of interest to that fund are covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is pretty technical. I am told that such guarantees of interest typically take the form that the board is called on to make up the rate of interest if it drops below 4 per cent. Those guarantees have not been called on for a number of years. Indeed, they were given a nil capital value at the time of the 1974 Act valuations. But given that we all expect great success from the Government's anti-inflation measures it is conceivable that eventually those guarantees could be called on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an appropriate stage we shall add to schedule 8 the name of this important pensions society whose interests might otherwise not be completely guaranteed.

With that undertaking I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that there is no room to insert the entire amendment, and that we shall cover such minor technical points as appear necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether we have done more harm than good in tabling the amendment. If we have done harm it is by accident, in that we have drawn the Government's attention to the fact that they have an obligation that they did not know about. If we have done good, it seems that we have done good by revealing the existence of certain obligations that the Government had overlooked. They actually overlooked pension schemes. That must be the height of carelessness on the part of a Ministry drafting a Bill designed specifically to deal with railway pensions. The Government criticise those who have administered some of the schemes in the past. At least those people did not forget the schemes but kept them going, albeit not always in a way of which the Government would approve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still have not understood from what the Parliamentary Secretary has said precisely how and where in the Bill these particular relevant pension obligations are covered. Do the terms of this clause place a liability on the Government to regard those guarantees as to interest or capital as part of their own obligations, or is this covered elsewhere in the Bill? If it is in this clause, can the Minister tell us where?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that it is in clause 44(1)(	<i>a</i>) which refers to "any obligations … in connection with the scheme". I am advised that if an obligation of the board relates to assets held by the British Rail pensions scheme, it also relates to pension liabilities against which those assets are held. The result is that that broad definition of obligations includes the obligations to guarantee the realisation of capital in one or two cases and of these long-funded interests and guarantees which might presumably one day be called upon again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On an earlier occasion, I asked the Government to contemplate the very unlikely event of their economic policies succeeding, but the idea was pushed aside. I am glad that another amendment, which was not intended to achieve that purpose, has actually forced the Parliamentary Secretary to contem-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2086</span>
plate that same unlikely event. However, I accept his assurance that all of these schemes, in so far as they are subject to the guarantees, will be covered and protected and will be within the definition of relevant pension obligations. I therefore urge my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, accept that assurance, provided that the Parliamentary Secretary will undertake to check before the Report stage that the Manchester and Liverpool railway Huskisson accident fund has been wound up and should not be included in the clause.

I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that we have advanced somewhat from an amendment of uncertain intention, which certainly revealed some improvements to be made. Bearing in mind our earlier debates in the Committee, when there was some difference as to whether the Opposition were contributing to progress on the Bill, I think that at this stage we may rightfully claim that we are making improvements even if we are not aware of what they actually mean. Today, therefore, in this Committee and on this clause, what might seem a very small step for Parliament seems to have been a very large step for those who will administer the pension fund from the booking office at Wandsworth Common station. We may therefore feel, in supporting the clause, that we have done a worthwhile job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the request by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) for an undertaking, I assure him that any suggestions as to new funds to compensate Conservative Ministers run down by railway trains will be favourably considered. If the hon. Gentleman cares to table a new clause to that effect, we might consider slipping it in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments simply fulfil an undertaking I gave earlier that for the avoidance of doubt, we would list in the schedule the separate sections to make clear that they would be treated separately for the purpose of determining the funded proportion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what the Parliamentary Secretary said. He has fully met his undertaking that the sections would be listed separately so that there can be no question of the assets being lumped together. I believe that concern was expressed about the possibility of LNER and other schemes being lumped together, thus causing disadvantage to some extent and also being in breach of specific provision laid down by statutory instrument against
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2088</span>
