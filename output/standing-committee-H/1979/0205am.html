	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 137, in page 12, line 6, at end insert
	<br><q><p>"after consultation with the district councils concerned and sections 2(3)(	<i>b</i>) and 2(5) of the Transport Act 1978 shall apply to such consultations".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 138, in page 12, line 6, at end insert
	<br><q><p>"subject to the application indicating that no district council in the area of that local authority has objected to being included within the local area proposed by the authority".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are sorry, in coming to the amendment, to note the absence of the Minister of Transport. The amendment, coupled with amendment No. 138, would give to district councils—and for this purpose district councils can cover borough councils within shire counties—the right to prevent their areas from being made trial areas. That is to say, it would give them the right to prevent the Minister from designating their areas as areas in which people could operate stage carriage services without road service licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause as drafted provides no right for these bodies effectively to object. It does not even give them the right to be consulted when that important decision is being considered—a decision which in their view may be of absolutely crucial importance to their ability to run their own transport services or at least to have a degree of control over the way in which those services are run. I believe that matter to be of crucial importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a narrow party issue that we raise—I wish to make that clear at the beginning. It has the support of the Association of District Councils, which means it is supported by Conservative, Labour, Liberal and Independent council-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>922</span>
lors up and down the country who are highly concerned about the effect of the Bill upon the bus services within the areas that they represent. These councils, particularly those that run transport undertakings, have knowledge of that important area of the Bill and of what is involved in running passenger transport services within their areas. They have experience of running such undertakings and they are required to be democratically accountable for the running of those services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it has been noticeable in local elections over the last few years how that particular subject has been given far greater prominence in political debate. Therefore, councillors are very likely to feel a sense of concern, obligation and accountability to those who say "Why cannot our service be improved? Why cannot buses be run to a better schedule on this route?" or "Why is a service being withdrawn?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is useless to be accountable or to carry such a responsibility unless one has an element of control over those decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
County councils can and do impose a number of conditions on district authorities in the way in which they run their transport services. So there is no question of the record showing any great impartiality on the part of county councils in their dealings with districts on this matter. They have interpreted present legislation—as they are entitled to do—as laying upon them responsibilities for planning the network of services throughout the whole of their areas. They have regarded it as entitling them to impose conditions on district and borough councils that are running their own services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to illustrate that with an example which concerns me deeply, because it comes from my constituency. The borough of Barrow-in-Furness applied to Cumbria county council for TSG support in the running of one of its corporation services, which goes along the coast road. As the constituency is on the end of a peninsula it is probably an ideal case to consider, because it does not have as many problems with cross-boundary services as those that are totally landlocked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Barrow-in-Furness has, in the view of the members of its district council, an obligation to those who live on the coast road that runs along the side of Morecambe Bay to provide a bus service. That service is not economic and not viable, nor
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>923</span>
is it likely to become profit-making. However, I believe that the council is entitled to exercise its right to determine that such a service is required in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council applied to Cumbria county council for support under the TSG arrangements to continue to run that service. The answer that it received was "We shall provide you with an element of support under TSG subject to your meeting conditions laid down by the county council." Those conditions included the district council's raising from fares 50 per cent. of the total operating cost of that service. It was given no discretion whatever about the extent to which cross-subsidisation could operate between that route and others run by the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It also found that the county council had a policy of requiring municipal undertakings run by district councils within the county to adjust their fares, if it required them to do so, to rates that it had determined in its negotiations with the Ribble service arising from TSG. I mention that because I have checked with councils in a number of other areas who have had exactly the same experience. County councils will use their powers to impose fare structures on district councils as a condition of TSG provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have stated that to make clear beyond any shadow of doubt that the passing of the amendment will not, of itself, prevent a county council from exercising its rights and powers to effect networking arrangements in the county. The amendment will give the district council what I contend is an elementary democratic right to say "If we are to work under the restrictions and obligations imposed on us by Parliament, by a Minister and by a county council, surely we should have the right to object to an arbitrary decision to remove from our area the requirement for a road service licence for a stage carriage service."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the restrictions imposed by counties, it would be bad enough trying to maintain and operate stage carriage services in some areas even if one had a clear knowledge of road service licensing conditions. However, without them it will become very difficult, if not absolutely impossible. I believe that the members of Cumbria county council are not necessarily indifferent to the transport services of Barrow, but they just do not have the detailed knowledge of the district council
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>924</span>
members. In fact, some of them do not know what is involved in running services, say, from Barrow to Stainton, Askam, or Gleaston. Some of them do not even know whether there are bus services for the residents of Stank or Newton or some of the other places in my constituency. The district councils who represent those areas know those problems intimately. Surely they should have the elementary right to say that the county council shall not approach the Minister to make us an area in which services are run without road service licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can appreciate that the Minister has had many thoughts about this clause, not only second, but third and fourth thoughts. Having listened to the ministerial contributions on previous clauses laying down the conditions attached to road service licences, one can clearly see that the Minister would dearly love to abolish licensing altogether. Many of the speeches that he has made have suggested that the theme of his approach is that licensing is a terrible restriction, a horrible Socialist plot to prevent the entrepreneur from running vastly better services than those now operating in the country. If he had the courage of that conviction, this Bill would not have been before us. We should not have had this timid and tentative approach. The Minister would have proposed a Bill to abolish Road Service Licensing throughout the length and breadth of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That contrasts dramatically with what the clause says, namely that the trial areas can only be brought about provided the county area volunteers, and the Minister then agrees. So, presumably, even if all the county areas volunteered themselves as trial areas—a magnificent response to the Minister's approach in this part of the Bill—we should not see them all become trial areas. There is an innate caution, a built-in contradiction between the approach that was used in drafting this clause and the approach which was used in other parts of the Bill. One would imagine that if hon. Members on the Government side had been converted by their Minister, as they appear to have been by their voting record on this Bill, to the belief that road service licensing is highly undesirable, they would see trial areas as entrepreneurial oases in a desert of licensing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if that is their approach, why do they not call upon the Minister to make the desert bloom, to turn it all into an entrepreneurial garden in which such
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>925</span>
transport services can flourish? They know very well, however, that in this clause they are up against a fundamental contradiction. I appeal to strike a blow for local democracy in the name of Labour, Liberal, Conservative and Independent councillors throughout the country, who have thrust upon them the difficult task of trying to deal with transport services in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least let them be able to ensure that while the Minister has not made up his mind and is under no obligation in the terms of his own Bill to designate trial areas, while he wants to insert "may" rather than "shall", at least local councils should, in view of their experience, their accountability and their intimate knowledge of the passenger transport requirements of their areas, have the right to object and to be excluded from trial areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 12 is thoroughly bad. It is the worst clause in the Bill so far. Leaving aside any argument about the conception of trial areas and their function, the way the clause is drafted, and the powers that it gives—or does not give—are totally unsatisfactory. That is why I rise to support amendments Nos. 137 and 138.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not spend many words on my first point. It is that the consultative obligations of county councils under clause 12 are at a bare minimum. County councils do not have to consult if they do not want to. Although I admit that I am not a "small print" man, I have examined clause 12 and schedule 2 as carefully as I can. There is no obligation on the county council to consult anyone. In paragraph 2 of schedule 2 the word used is "notify"—
	<br><q><p>"the local authority concerned shall also notify"</p></q>
the district council, among other bodies. I do not feel that that is good enough for a clause that seeks to set up experiments and—I hope—monitor them carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other objection is that the approach outlined in clause 12 is at variance with the consultative procedures set up by the Transport Act 1978. Amendment 137 specifically mentions section 2(b)(	<i>b</i>) and section 2(5) of the 1978 Act. Section 2(3) of that Act says
	<br><q><p>"When preparing or revising the plan, and when considering from time to time the way in which they are to discharge their responsibilities
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>926</span>
under section 1 above, the council shall enter into consultations with—"</p></q>
It then says
	<ol>
	<li>public passenger transport service operators in the county, or their representatives;</li>
	<li>district councils in the county".</li>
</ol>
That is the straight thrust of section 2 of the 1978 Act. The consultative obligations in clause 12 are simply not good enough. The powers could be used by county councils in the wrong way. No obligation is laid upon them to consult anyone. If a county council were so minded that could be completely intolerant and dictatorial. Frankly, that is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they have any sense, county councils will not embark on experimental proposals in trial areas without consultation. Of course they will consult. I know of backwoodsmen in some areas of the country who would attempt to go ahead without consultation, but there are not many. In practice, district councils would be consulted. But there is no obligation upon county councils to consult them. Any legislation worthy of the name, which aims to be democratic and to allow for consultation, should lay down an obligation either in the clause or in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall leave aside for the moment the whole argument about the desirability or otherwise of experimental areas. If these experimental areas are to succeed, the county council, in approaching the Ministry of Transport for the designation of an area as an experimental area, the idea will go off at half cock if the experience of district councils is not incorporated in the application which is to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing partisan in the two amendments. At present, district councils are controlled by Conservative interests, so it is clear that we do not table the amendments in any partisan political way. We are arguing for the principle of consultation. If the county council is to designate any area, it is surely common sense that an obligation is put on that county council to consult the district council involved. After all, the district council is at the grass roots of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point. Many county councils are broadly rural but contain large urban intrusions. For instance, the county of Avon has within it Bristol, and the urban area of Bristol dominates the county of Avon. In my own county of Suffolk, the largest urban area is Ipswich—the old county borough of Ipswich, but I leave
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>927</span>
Suffolk out of the argument, because I do not make constituency cases one way or other in this Committee. However, it frequently happens that the controlling interest of a county council is rural. Yet in the urban area of any district council, a different set of transport problems exists from the problems in a rural area. Therefore, there must be the obligation to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be disagreement between the county council and the district council about the area to be designated. I imagine that there is often a difference of opinion. If that difference cannot be resolved, the district council should have the right to object, and that right should be built into the framework of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two amendments contain nothing strikingly new. There is a sound precedent in the 1978 legislation, which is now in operation and which has been on the statute book for some time. There is a prima facie case, purely on the common sense and justice of the matter, that district councils should be consulted and be given the right to object. That would avoid a lot of trouble, and experimental areas would be more likely to succeed with these amendments than without them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am gradually discovering, it appears to be the function of the Opposition, both on the Floor of the House and in Committee, to evince horror and indigation and astonishment at anything that the Government propose. I do not go so far as to evince horror and indignation at the exclusion of district councils from any participation in decision-making about trial areas, but when I first read the Bill it was that aspect that most surprised me. To give powers to county councils to affect the area of one district council within that county's area, without any obligation to consult and without giving a veto to the district council, is quite astonishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no exaggeration to say that the provision has led to horror and indignation on the part of district councils and the Association of District Councils. As my hon. Friend said, there is no substantial party political line-up on this matter. The non-metropolitan districts are predominantly Conservative and will remain so. Even half of those district councils with their own transport undertakings are Conservative controlled, and a substantial
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>928</span>
proportion of them is likely to remain so in any game of swings and roundabouts. Therefore, the Government, and certainly Government Back Benchers, should be paying attention to the representatives of the lowest and consequently the most grass-roots part of our local government system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can divide the relevant district councils into two clear categories. There are those which have their own transport undertakings and those which do not. Under the Bill, a county council that had been involved in public transport for no more than five or six years would be able to decide that an area, say that of Blackpool district council, was to be a trial area, in spite of violent opposition from the elected representatives of the people of Blackpool and from the district council that had had responsibility for public transport for most of the twentieth century. In certain areas that could be interpreted as a straightforward political division. For instance, the Derby district council transport undertaking could be Labour controlled and the county of Derbyshire Tory controlled, although that would be a marginal matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment the city of Kingston-upon-Hull, part of which my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has the honour to represent, is Labour controlled, and the county is Conservative controlled. There may not be a single representative from one of those towns or cities who represents the majority party on a county council. Every representative of a district on a county council could be opposed to a trial area being de-licensed. Yet despite all democratic theory, the county council, in cahoots with the Minister, could introduce a trial area. That is a recipe for disaster as well as a denial of the right of the elected representatives of district councils to have a major influence on what happens in their areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that that will not always be a party-political argument. As hon. Gentlemen know, some of the fiercest and most unproductive relationships arise between county and district councils of the same political persuasion. It is possible for the relations between a small district and a large county council to be similar to the political relations between Albania and the Soviet Union. Some of these relationships are more bitter than the relationships between
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>929</span>
county and district councils of different parties. We may well see the Bournemouth district council fighting the Dorset county council to the death over such an issue, or Blackpool fighting Lancashire, or Brighton fighting whichever part of Sussex it is located in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to be approaching a situation where the county councils will be able to make wholesale changes to the life of people living in towns in their areas. The question of public passenger transport is not trivial. It is not a bit of theoretical policy-making by county councils. Many of the functions of the county councils relating to transport are concerned with long-term policy-making which may very well never have any impact or whose impact may be minimal. But this is not a theoretical drawing-board job. Immediately a trial area came into operation, it could immediately and seriously affect the general living standards and conditions of life of up to 200,000 people living in a major town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, it seems absolutely preposterous that the districts should have no veto over proposals to de-license. At the moment this refers only to those districts which have transport undertakings and can therefore see themselves much more clearly in conflict with the county council, because they have the responsibility for running the buses. But I do no think that we can confine our comments to the fairly limited number of district councils—I think there are about 50 of them—with passenger transport undertakings. There are more than 400 district councils in England and Wales which have no passenger transport undertakings but nevertheless, even if they are not running a bus service, are closely and immediately concerned with the passenger transport provision in their area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from the history of passenger transport, and transport in general, that many district councils—in particular the bigger ones—have contributed a great deal to the thinking on and the development of passenger transport and in some cases have done a far better job than the counties, which have the statutory responsibility. That is partly, of course, because until fairly recently many of the counties had very little duty to involve themselves in any transport matters other than road-building. Consequently, a num-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>930</span>
ber of the more far-sighted reports on public transport in particular localities have been produced by district councils which did not even have the responsibility to provide the buses. They have shown a better quality of thought. They are able to give much more detailed consideration to the needs of their areas than is the county council, which may include only two or three representatives from a particular district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pulling an example out of the air. The attitude of the North Yorkshire county council, say, to the provision of buses in Scarborough may well be thoroughly admirable—absolutely first-rate. But on the other hand only a very limited number of representatives from Scarborough are sitting in the council chamber in Northallerton, which is a long way away. There may be only two or three representatives from Scarborough sitting on the county council and they may not, by any means, represent all the interests in Scarborough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position could arise, therefore, where the Scarborough and Whitby council has firm and clear views based on its own detailed and immediate experience of the transport problems and demands of its area, but finds that, for reasons it does not understand, it has been designated as a trial area by the North Yorkshire county council waving, in effect, two fingers at the district council and anything that it puts forward. In fact, I believe that, if he still holds the position, the chairman of the North Yorkshire transport and planning committee represents Scarborough. But that does not necessarily mean that he represents the Scarborough and Whitby district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is enormous potential for a county to intervene and rip an area's public transport to pieces by the introduction of trial areas without any real concern for the views of the district council affected. Amendment No. 138 imposes an obligation on the Minister, as well as the county council. The Minister, or his officials, will have to find out whether the district council in the area of the county has objected to being included in the trial area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know what weight the Minister, or his officials, will attach to representations made to him. The Minister is strongly committed—I was going to say fanatical, but he does not strike me as a fanatic—to the concept of de-licensing,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>931</span>
and appears to be strongly committed to the concept of trial areas. I am sure that some Conservative Members see themselves as representing districts, or parts of districts, rather than counties. I ask them, bearing in mind that the Minister is dedicated to introducing trial areas, what chance they consider their district councils will stand, if opposed to trial areas, in making representations to their county and, further, making representations to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of trial areas will, if they work, introduce dramatic changes. Presumably the Minister will introduce them only if they work. There will be no control over anybody doing anything in public transport in a trial area. There will be control over safety and, as I understand it, there will be some notification of what services will or will not be provided. But beyond that anybody will be able to run a bus anywhere, at any time, in a trial area without anyone intervening, supervising, licensing, guiding, advising, or anything else. It would be absurd if, in spite of opposition from the locally elected representatives of whatever party in the district most intimately affected, that position should arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If would be absurd for two reasons. First, I believe in the principle that the people who are elected to represent the district ought to have a substantial say, if not a veto, over such proposals. Secondly, the sort of battle that would ensue from introducing trial areas in a district in the face of total opposition from its district council will waste a gigantic amount of time and money and bring our general system of public administration into disrepute. God knows, enough money is wasted already in arguments between upper and lower tier authorities in this country. If this kind of dramatic change is imposed upon districts, there will be even more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will finish on what I hope is a humorous note. We are dealing with trial areas. You, Mr. Dean, represent part of the county of Somerset. It seems to me that we may well reach a situation in which a certain hanging judge whose portrait hangs on the other side of the corridor—Judge Jeffreys—will reappear in the form of the Minister to sentence a district council in Somerset to having a shambles in public transport. That would be most unfortunate. The people of the district should be in a posi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>932</span>
tion to take the headsman's axe away from both the Minister and the county council if the people of that district and their elected representatives oppose the introduction of trial areas. Otherwise, we shall have worse transport, even more dissatisfaction with local government than exists at present, and perhaps a move towards the Minister deciding everything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this country we have never subscribed to the view that there should be central direction over anything as general as this in local government. It would be most unfortunate if a situation arose in which all of the elected representatives of both, all three or even seven political parties—I understand that the Bill covers Wales as well—on a district council opposed the introduction of a trial area but a county council with a majority of one successfully applied to the Minister for a trial area to be created in that district. The Minister, who had no connection whatever with the area, might decide that as he was committed to the idea, a trial area should be introduced. That would do no good to the transport system in the area, and it would severely damage the reputation of our system of government generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his colleagues are always talking about reducing Government interference in people's lives. He should therefore be reluctant to take on the role of sole determinant, which is what this means in the end, of whether an area does without bus licensing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both amendments seek to be constructive. If the Minister does not accept them, it will be tantamount to declaring total war between counties and districts. I have had the good fortune simultaneously to sit on a county council and a district council, and I know that many Conservative Members also have local government experience. I have seen the chaos that may arise as a result of disputes about functions and from one authority not consulting the other. If the amendments are not accepted, the Minister cannot assume that consultations will take place. In a large number of cases they will not. A provision of this kind to make consultations mandatory is required in order to ensure that they will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the Minister will oppose these amendments because he has given no indication to the contrary as yet. On the occasions when it has suited his case he has referred to the Transport Act 1978. That is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>933</span>
quite fair and reasonable. On this occasion, undoubtedly he will not refer to that Act. It does not suit his case because in effect the clause takes something out of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Minister and I sat on the Transport Bill Committee in 1978 and it was then that the precedent for consultation was well established. It would be interesting to ask the Minister what kind of representations he had with various authorities before removing the consultation provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The logic is not being followed by the Minister because one has to look at this with the rigmarole set out in schedule 2 which is relevant to it. Schedule 2 goes to great lengths about publishing notices in newspapers and making sure that every authority is informed. I think that the Minister sees the logic because he wants people to know what is going on. If the logic of informing people is valid, surely the corollary to that must be that, as they have been informed, they have a right to be consulted on their views. If that is not so perhaps the Minister will tell us why he bothers to inform anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone is simply told that something has happened, is about to happen, or will happen, that person is denied the right to be consulted. It seems to me that the person is being insulted because he is not told that he can act on the information. Why bother informing him? It seems pointless unless the person has a right to be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; Order. I must remind the hon. Gentleman that be begins to stray into schedule 2. A specific amendment, which will be called, has been put down, dealing with this particular point. So I must ask the hon. Gentleman to return to the amendment, which is about consultation with district councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Dean. It was necessary to say a little to highlight the point. Obviously I shall not stray again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Minister have this inbuilt inhibition about consultation? Surely he wants trial areas to work. I presume he does, otherwise he would not have them in the Bill. If that is so, surely trial areas will work better with co-operation. If he wants co-operation, surely it will be better if everyone is consulted and all the little problems are ironed out before the Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>934</span>
makes the order. If the Minister cannot see the logic of that I fail to comprehend any of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be interesting to discover how many hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have received correspondence on this point. There is a great deal of feeling already and the Bill has not yet become an Act. Without any shadow of doubt, when it becomes an Act, representations will be made to the Minister from district councils on the basis that they have not been consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 138. The logic of the argument seems to be that if the Minister sees fit to consult—as Opposition Members firmly believe should happen—and give everyone an opportunity not only to know what is going on but to be part of it—that is the object of consultation—we must carry amendment No. 138. If consultations take place and there are objections the Minister needs to know the extent of those consultations. If that were not so there would be no point in the consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not agree that if, at their discretion, county councils consult district councils, those consultations would be spoiled because under this Bill the district councils have a totally subordinate position which would colour their whole attitude to the consultations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a fundamental point which is valid and deserves to be heeded. I am asking, what is the point in writing in consultation provisions if the Minister is not aware of consultations. He will not become aware unless we carry amendment No. 138. If he wishes to make a trial here, surely he wants to know who is happy and who is not. But he will not know, because at present there is no right of consultation. Even if, as the Minister assumes, some consultation takes place, how is he to know what has been said, or even whether it has taken place at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central has referred to schedule 2, in which he will see that districts must be informed. They therefore make representations to counties, and the counties are under a duty to forward all representa-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>935</span>
tions to the Minister before he decides, and he is, in fact, obliged to consider all the representations. So everything that the district council and anyone else puts to the county about the trial has to be considered by the Minister before he designates the area. But that is something we can explore more fully when we debate schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's explanation seems a fundamental and sound reason for accepting the amendments. If it happens in schedule 2 let us make it mandatory in the clause and put the book right. We will then ensure that what he hopes will happen does happen. The Minister is obviously living in cloud-cuckoo land. Nothing will make a county consult a district if it does not wish to unless it is in the Act. I know that from nothing other than practical experience. Hon. Members opposite who have sat on local government know as well as I the problems between county and district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will back up the logic of what he has said by accepting amendments No. 137 and 138 and save the country from total war between district councils and county councils and make consultation mandatory and objections known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With these amendments we enter into our first debate about trial areas. So far my worst fears have been realised about the Opposition's reaction to trial areas. To hear my right hon. Friend likened to Judge Jeffreys and hear of the possibility of warfare breaking out between districts and councils all over the country on this issue seems to indicate that the whole matter has got totally out of proportion. Certainly with one or two operators outside the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is that we are indeed enthusiastic about the notion of trial areas, which will be areas where no form of road service licensing exists. There will be no form of quantity control, although the safety requirements on vehicles will be as rigorous as anywhere else, I underline that for the benefit of the general public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly true that our enthusiasm for trial areas is based upon considerable scepticism about the value of road service licensing. We put forward the proposal because there are parts of the country where the whole paraphernalia of road
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>936</span>
service licensing is probably not serving any useful public function. It is a habit into which the industry has slipped over 50 years, and it now serves to obstruct new ideas, initiative and operators, and sometimes even protects inefficient monopoly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that scepticism and the belief that road service licensing could prove unnecessary in many circumstances, the approach in the Bill is prudent and cautious. It was described by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) as "timid and tentative", and that led me to wonder at one point why he went on to make so much fuss about the amendments which, if carried, would make it so timid and tentative as to be practically non-existent. What is in the Bill is based on prudence and caution. We wish to test the belief that road service licensing will prove unnecessary in trial areas introduced in consultation with county councils and upon application by the county councils themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
County councils are already charged under existing legislation with the general transport responsibility for their county. For that reason, because the Bill does not seek to undermine in any way the county councils' general responsibility, these designation orders will be made only where the county council actually applies to become a trial area. We expect that eventually, when the Bill is passed, about two or three counties will go all the way and become trial areas, either in whole or in part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, more counties than that are interested—about a dozen. Some have already started consultation, have announced their intentions and are sounding out views. The Government expect that in the end two or three counties will become trial areas. Therefore, the amendments are concerned with limited areas of the country, probably two or three county councils, in which, the Opposition contend, the present arrangements for the participation of districts are not adequate. One of the amendments seeks to place a statutory obligation on counties to consult all districts. The other seeks to give any district councils a veto, in effect, over the possibility of there being a trial area. It passes the responsibility for transport planning from the county to the district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Bill is based on a prudent and cautious approach, there is no need
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>937</span>
to write either of these safeguards into the Bill. The district councils' legitimate interest can be met by the Bill as it stands. The effect of imposing further statutory consultation procedures or a vote on the process is likely to lead to delay and limit the number of trials areas that can be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the county councils considering trial areas conduct their arrangements? It seems inconceivable that any county council would consider a trial area without consultation and discussion with the district councils involved. I am not aware of any county council that is proposing to do that. I agree with the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and others that the relationships between county counties and districts can be pretty bad, regardless of political control and supposed alliances between them. But the counties already have a statutory duty—under section 2 of the Transport Act 1978—to consult district councils when preparing or revising their public transport plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That covers the whole range of public transport and it would be an important part of a county council's public transport proposals if it were contemplating a trial area for its bus services. The consultation procedures of the 1978 Act seem to cover that thoroughly—indeed, too thoroughly. I shall refer to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over and above that, the Bill inserts into the existing consultation procedures—to make sure that they cover any suggestion of a trial area—the arrangements of schedule 2. I shall leave the detailed consideration of that until later, but it is relevant to point out that schedule 2 will place a county under an obligation to notify the district of its intention. It will allow time for that district to make representations to the county council, and if they are overruled by the county council, they must be forwarded by the county to the Minister. He is charged with considering those representations before making any designation order to create a trial area. Representations to the Minister may also be made by many others—trade unions and so on. Meanwhile the position of the district is adequately covered by giving that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to me to provide a framework which is a perfectly adequate safeguard for the district councils. Why, then, does one resist putting in yet another additional safeguard—the statutory duty
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>938</span>
to consult, contained in amendment No. 137?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one considers our experience under section 2 of the Transport Act 1978, one becomes hesitant about imposing on local authorities too many statutory duties to consult. Sensible authorities consult in practice, informally or formally. Statutory consultation all too easily turns into an elaborate, slow and expensive process. Having travelled all over the country this year to our regional meetings with the counties, I can assure the Committee that almost all county councils—certainly all those with which I have discussed the problem—complain that their present obligations under section 2 of the 1978 Act lead to elaborate, time-consuming and resource-wasting processes. The processes are very expensive in staff time. The expense is out of proportion to the good realised in producing the plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In due course, outside the Bill, my right hon. Friend will review the working of public transport plans and consider whether anything can be done to reduce the expenditure and staff time which they consume. But at the moment the plans are there; that is the present arrangement. If one introduces statutory consultation into the Bill, there is a real danger of expectations—expectations which will be realised—that cumbersome, and time-consuming procedures will be evolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such procedures will certainly be demanded by those district councils which are flatly against the whole idea of trial areas in their or any other district. Some of those councils are controlled by people who are as hostile to the whole idea of competition in transport, as well as trial areas, as many members of the Committee are, and who will use the statutory consultation procedures deliberately to delay and obstruct the implementation of the county council's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have little experience in local government. Could the hon. Gentleman indicate the difference in terms of time and money between statutory consultation and the discussions with the districts which he hopes that sensible authorities will have? I find it difficult to appreciate the difference, but that may be because of my lack of knowledge of local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>939</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Consultation can cover a whole range of procedures. In this Committee, consultation can mean two hon. Members from opposite sides of the Committee wandering out into the corridor to have a chat about a particular matter. Between local authorities, consultation may mean one officer picking up a telephone and talking to another. On the other hand, it may mean each party passing resolutions and exchanging them and considering each other's plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, once there is a statutory duty, much more elaborate procedures tend to be devised. That is what has happened in practice with the public transport plans. With a statutory right to be consulted, a local authority feels itself to be in a stronger position to demand more and more detail from the other tiers of government obliged to consult it, and to ask for more and more time to consider the plans of the other authority. If the authority charged with a duty to consult does not comply with that duty, it is fearful of its legal position and therefore feels obliged to concede to more and more demands made in the name of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, once there is a statutory duty, there is a tendency for procedures to become lengthy and over-elaborate. To a limited extent that is what appears to have happened—I do not say that it was done deliberately—under the 1978 Act. The statutory obligation certainly gives greater opportunities to the district council which is flatly opposed to the policy of the county council and wishes simply to frustrate the whole proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems basically to be saying that he stands for the county council at the expense of the district. Let us consider the logic of what he is saying. He is frightened that if there is to be statutory consultation the county council and the district council will set up committees which will discuss the matter and then come together. But why will that not happen in any case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister proposing? He is proposing that the county should notify the district and everyone else. He is proposing that he will receive any representations made in writing to the county council. So there is nothing to stop the district council having a committee to consider the notification, discuss it and make a decision on it. In fact, the county would be better off if there were joint
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>940</span>
consultative committees all of the time because that would be quicker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman runs a suggestion for a joint consultative committee he displays what I have in mind—that when a district entitled to be consulted starts suggesting that a whole new joint committee be set up to consider what is proposed that pushes the county into a difficult position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Informal consultation—that consultation for which sensible council opts in practice—means that both parties can be expected to get on with matters. There is nothing to be exploited at such a consultation by one side or the other. Councils already have a statutory duty to consult under the existing Act and I have already indicated that it would be over- elaborating to put yet another statutory duty to consult upon the councils, as is proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further final point about statutory consultation in the Bill. Any consultation required by the Bill could begin only after the Bill receives Royal Assent and becomes an Act, and when consultation became a legal obligation that would have to start. Consultation has started in a number of areas. The county of Nottinghamshire is in the process of consulting districts and practically anybody in the county who has a view about proposals that it has for a trial area, and a number of other areas have gone public and are in the process of consulting. It would be argued by those opposed to counties still intending to become trial areas once the Bill has received Royal Assent that any consultation before then would not be statutory consultation under the Bill and, therefore, that the whole process would have to start again, so merely giving rise to opportunities for delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 138. The position set out therein by the Opposition reveals their real intention that in practice, so far as possible, the districts should be given the power of veto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman nods in agreement and is obviously anxious that his district of Barrow-in-Furness should have an absolute right of veto over any proposal put forward by the county.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that, effectively, that is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>941</span>
transfer of an important part of the transport function from the counties to the districts. The example cited by the right hon. Gentleman was the worst possible example, because he has in mind that those districts he mentioned happen to be municipal bus operators. I say nothing about Barrow-in-Furness and I concede that I have no knowledge of the bus operations there, but when generally considering municipal bus operators it seems quite wrong and totally against the spirit of this piece of legislation that one particular operator should be given a veto over a trial area that, understandably, many will not be too happy about because that would expose them to competition and give their present captive passengers an opportunity for choice in the services that they might have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I make no specific reference to Barrow-in-Furness, but my opinion is that if one were to draw up a list of the least efficient bus undertakings in this country, one or two municipal operations would comfortably head that list. The worst examples of complacent monopoly tend to exist in those areas where a bus undertaking is proudly carrying around a municipal crest without any longer fulfilling a useful function to its passengers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Name one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I resisted that temptation the last time that question was asked. The scale of the debate on the amendment would suddenly be dramatically widened if I were to launch into my theme of criticism of municipals. I believe that there are a lot of cities in this country where the ratepayers would do well to ask whether they are receiving the service that they should have from a municipal bus service. I do not believe that it is unreasonable if county councils are asked for transport supplementary grants by municipal bus undertakings to try to impose some minimum conditions of performance, cost-cutting and efficiency in making those necessary grants available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, I think that what I have said adequately indicates my resistance to the idea of giving every municipal bus undertaking a right of complete veto over whether a trial area should exist in its area. Some municipal bus undertakings would be improved if trial areas included those areas in which they operate and we believe that there are many bus under-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>942</span>
takings where the service to the public will be improved if trial areas are launched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we resist amendments which seek to make it more difficult to do that, and I invite the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 137 and 138.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has hopelessly muddled the issues of competition and trial area operation. But he has made one thing crystal clear—the fundamental difference between his approach to road service licences and that of the district councils. He has described road service licences as being in many cases an unnecessary protection of inefficient monopoly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The district councils fear—and many of my hon. Friends and I join them—that in certain, or perhaps many, cases the road service licensing procedure ensures that competition will not destroy the maintenance of certain services. A number of district councils believe—I recognise them as capable of judging their own areas, which the Parliamentary Secretary does not—that if a trial area were imposed on them, a series of operators would come in to compete with an existing undertaking only during peak traffic periods. At present, there are operators prepared to work on the basis of making money at peak periods and using that to run services on Sundays and weekday off-peak times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One does not need to decide who is right and wrong in the argument to settle the issue of the amendment. The Minister objects to my using the word "tentative". However, "prudence" will do for the purpose. If the Minister recognises that it is necessary to be prudent in choosing areas, he does not have the courage of the Parliamentary Secretary's conviction that RSLs are unnecessary protection of inefficient monopoly. He needs to suck it and see in a few places to establish whether the district councils may be right and he may be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If district councils are right, they may be forced to be trial areas against their will and their services destroyed. If they are made to stand by impotently, with no say in the matter, while they see a collapse of the finances of a municipal undertaking—or even of a private one, which at present is prepared to take profits at peak times and cover off-peak periods and Sundays—the Minister is risking something that is precious to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to accept that when he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>943</span>
comes to judge such matters, the Minister will have some regard for the representations, but not that in so doing he will make adequate safeguards. Having had the experience of operating a Department, I know only too well how such representations are presented to Ministers, how it is urged upon them that they are based on local prejudices, that they come from fuddy-duddies in the sticks who do not realise what is going on in the big world and that they should be pushed into going along with what is broad ministerial policy. Our view is that those who have succeeded in maintaining bus services in their own areas know something about the issue and have a right not to have the concept of a trial area imposed on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I disagree fundamentally with the Parliamentary Secretary's justification, which rests on a fallacy. He has erected an Aunt Sally by saying that if district councils were to have a right of veto on a county council's making them a trial area, the county council would become impotent and lose its power to carry out its duties under the TPP policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that far from that, as I made clear in my original submission. The county councils have considerable control over district councils as to whether they run the undertakings, but particularly if they do run the undertakings. The district council has to talk to the county council if it is to obtain a transport grant, or any support at all. There is no need to write a requirement for that kind of consultation into legislation. The Minister can be absolutely certain that district councils will consult county councils if they wish to obtain TSG money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary's argument about competition is equally invalid in the context of the amendment. If there were no competition in places other than those designated areas, the preceding clauses of the Bill would not have achieved their objectives. Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is not saying that the designation of trial areas is the only way in which the Bill opens up possibilities for competition. That part of his argument is complete nonsense. It is unworthy of him. He usually presents better arguments. He knows full well that whether or not a district is designated a trial area, the Bill renders it liable to face competition different from that which it faces now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>944</span>
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make one final appeal. Presumably the Parliamentary Secretary wants the idea of trial areas to have a fair wind, a good run. If he wants the tests to have the best possible chance of success from his own point of view, it would be better to conduct them in areas where both the county and the district councils wish to see the tests take place. If he has the goodwill and the judgment of the district and the county councils to back him in designating the area, the trial will have a better chance of producing the desired results. The idea will get a fairer test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make two points. First, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to ratepayers' dissatisfaction with municipal transport undertakings. I am sure that that is accurate. There is general dissatisfaction with the standard of public transport. That is one of the reasons why the Bill is before us. The Opposition regard most of its provisions as irrelevant or damaging to the prospects of improving public transport. Nevertheless, it is a response to the general dissatisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary appears to pay no attention to the fact that the people responsible for running municipal undertakings—people who have been elected to run them—may find themselves Tuning them on an entirely different basis—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far as I know, no one is elected to run a municipal undertaking. People are elected to serve in local government, which may or may not run a municipal undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at a loss to follow that argument. When people put themselves up for election to a local authority that runs transport undertaking, it seems fairly likely that their election address will mention what they intend to do about running the municipal bus undertaking. If they are not being elected to run it, perhaps they are being elected not to run it. I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to stress the fact that the elected representatives responsible for running municipal undertakings may, over a number of years, have made investment decisions and policy decisions which were rational and well thought out at the time, but which may be rendered absurd by the introduction of trial areas. They may

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>945</span>
suffer substantial losses for which they will not be directly responsible. Such losses will be a consequence of the introduction of trial areas, not of any silly, ill-thought-out decisions on their part. That would be bad, and it would result in a loss for the ratepayers, about whom the Parliamentary Secretary was expressing concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further point—one that I have mentioned in other contexts in this legislation and one that I shall doubtless mention again. The Bill is basically a project to introduce even more irresponsibility into the public transport system. So many people are involved in public transport, interfering in other people's decision-making, that at any given time almost anybody can blame someone else for what is wrong with it. If the city of Nottingham, with which the Parliamentary Secretary is naturally more familiar than I am, were told that the Nottinghamshire county council intended to declare Nottingham district a trial area, one of the predictable human responses—possibly not be the elected committee, but I suspect by the senior management of the undertaking—would be "Why should we bother any more? We have made what we thought were rational plans and proposals. We have made investment decisions. We have recruited people. We have—or have not—built bus stations. We have—or have not—bought particular vehicles that did—or did not—work properly. We have done all these things for which we accept responsibility. Yet</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>In those circumstances, I believe that the natural response will be "Stuff it. There is nothing more we can do. All we can do is sit back and let things happen. Nothing that happens will be as bad as the introduction of the trial area, and there is no need in future for us to attempt to formulate rational policies or to take responsibility or to show any initiative to maintain a decent public transport system in Nottingham."

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 118 is intended as a strongly probing amendment. It makes two substantial points. The first concerns the two years' provision, and the second concerns consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the concern of my right hon. and hon. Friends about the process of trial area changes, if those changes should be necessary. But we see great difficulties in achieving the mechanism of trial areas without some form of stability. We have considered the period and made a tentative suggestion of two years, but that may appear to be impracticable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering trial areas we must recognise what has not, perhaps, been recognised by Opposition Members. It is the simple fact that the present bus system in this country is declining. Everything that has been said about it has been negative. No alternatives have been put forward. There has been much criticism of the Bill, but it is the first attempt, warts and all, in many decades to improve matters. It is strange that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen have not put forward in their amendments positive alternative approaches to cope realistically with the major problems that the bus industry and bus user will face. One is the constantly increasing price of oil. The nationalised concerns, such as the National Bus Company, have already demonstrated their difficulty in coming to grips with operating costs. That will not get easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us on the Conservative Benches, as we demonstrated on the 1978 Bill, would like to see far fewer restrictions than this Bill will impose. I can quote several of my hon. Friends who wish to see the role of the traffic commissioners removed entirely. We find a strange incongruity in that role. Therefore, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>948</span>
use of a trial area to create what is the most difficult thing in a complex, modern, democratic society, an experimental area, is a splendid way to reduce those restrictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our political, industrial and economic lives, we all face great difficulties in creating change. But I remind Opposition Members that if we do not create those changes and if we maintain the status quo as they want us to, there will be fewer and fewer buses as decades go by. Where is the alternative? I suggest that the alternative is to experiment. By doing so, one can protect the nation if the experiments go wrong, because by definition an experiment does not have certainty. So one can only welcome the trial areas provisions in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going rather wide and making a clause stand part speech. The amendment is very narrow, and I hope that, having made those preliminary remarks, he will now address himself to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Dean, and I shall do just that. I hope that the Committee will forgive me if my enthusiasm for the discussion carried me away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (4) there is a mechanism whereby the Minister can choose to change the status of trial areas. I should like to put two questions to the Minister, and I hope that on this strong probe, which has considerable support on the Government side of the Committee, he will give a more fundamental answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, by what procedure would the Minister make his decision to alter a trial area should there be clear signs that the trial area is failing? That is the crux of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One appreciates that a three-year period is necessary for investment by entrepreneurs in buses and coaches and in setting up services. I might add that it took three years for the small bus service in North Warwickshire that runs between "The Whitacres" villages and Coventry in my constituency to settle down and achieve break-even profitability, so I understand the need for three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put two years in the amendment because we feel that it is a safer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0520">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>949</span>
level, unless the Minister can assure us that the procedure by which he changes the decision will allow complete participation—not merely the narrow participation previously debated, which included district councils, however important they may be, but the comments of local trade unions and industry, local schools and parish councils, which should be good barometers of the public view of whether the bus service is successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the answer to the amendment is that the procedure should be sufficiently strong for us to accept that it is a real procedure. If it is not, we would prefer two years rather than three, because that would be a lesser risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not need to detain the Committee on this argument about consultation. The principle is the same. We are talking of the local authority being defined much more narrowly than in previous amendments where we were concerned with districts. With these amendments we are concerned about instances where a designation order has already been granted, and as the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) said, what would happen if an experiment was not working as expected within the three years, and we are concerned about what kind of flexibility the Minister has to make a revocation order or to amend the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seems to be reasonably clear in that it provides that the order cannot be revoked or varied within the three-year period. We think that any request should be subject to views of the local authority—the authority being as defined in the Bill, bearing in mind our arguments about district councils. Certainly the elected representatives, the local authority, should have some influence on the Minister when he considers revocation or amendment of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in some difficulty. I have looked through the Bill and cannot see what criteria the Minister will have for intervening. It says that he shall not revoke or adjust the period within the three years. It also makes clear that if he wants to extend the area, he cannot do so by some form of alteration but must bring in a new order for the designation. I am, therefore, in some difficulty in understanding what powers he has to do what, and where—particularly on the two or three years, which does not appear to solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>950</span>
The fear expressed by those concerned in a trial area is that the experiment may collapse. One can understand the argument put forward by the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills), that it is necessary to have a three-year period for investment. But if the experiment collapses, one assumes that the operator is bankrupt and cannot be discharged any further. Therefore, if the argument is to protect the investment, and it has failed, clearly an application by the local authority to the Minister to revoke or amend the order would not damage the already failed service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority would not make an order if the service was working successfully. The Minister would, rightly, be able to say "I am not prepared to change this order because the service is working reasonably well. The passengers are getting their service and the investor appears to be getting his return in that he is continuing the service."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other side of the coin in arguing to protect the investor is what is the position of the passengers? All the investor need do once he is found to be bankrupt is to give notice by advertisement, and other clauses may well give him almost complete right completely to withdraw the service. In that case, the passengers and the public are not guaranteed the maintenance of the service. Therefore, this clause weighs heavily towards the investor, provided he is prepared to give at least three years' service, but does little, if there is a collapse, to help the maintenance of a service for the passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister could argue that the local authority could give revenue support if the service had been started without that support. If the operator was in financial difficulties, presumably he could make an application to the local authority and say, "I am sorry, my projections are not as good as I thought. If I am to maintain the service the authority must help me with revenue support." We are then back on the same track, but with one very distinctive difference—the revenue support will be somewhat open ended. The local athuority will be faced with an ultimatum from the operator saying "Either you pay for the service or we withdraw it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the present position of the local authorities, except that a local authority has some negotiation with the bus operator who is operating a whole umbrella network of services. The operator can be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0521">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>951</span>
told "You are doing well in some profitable areas, but in the non-profitable areas you are not and, therefore, you must cross-subsidise." In the present case, we are referring to an entirely different system altogether, where the operator has no such obligation upon him—only the service which he has advertised and said he will maintain. To that extent, the position is heavily loaded towards the investors. If the service fails, there seems to be very little control for the local authority to have any influence over decisions, except in the revenue area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, therefore, the amendment is largely about the local authorities—the elected representatives—having some influence over the transport policy in the area during the three years. That is what is involved. The local authority has not opted out from giving support in the trial areas, but still retains its position in the area. However, we suggest that any order or revocation considered by the Minister should only be carried out at the request of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting to read, in Standing Committee F of the Passenger Vehicles (Experimental Areas) Bill, on 14 June 1977, an amendment to clause 1 which was concerned with the designation of those areas. The amendment was moved by the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler), who is now the Minister of Transport. The amendment read:
	<br><q><p>"Such an extension shall be made at the request of the relevant local authority.".</p></q>
The justification for that amendment was the very ringing words:
	<br><q><p>"The amendment would allow that, not on the say-so of Whitehall, but on the initiative of the local authorities."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 14 June 1977; c.6]</p></q>
In other words, the amendment gave power to the local people. One could use those exact words for the amendment now before us, which the Minister will no doubt accept unless he has changed his attitude towards the principle of giving power to the people, as he believed when in Opposition in 1977.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Minister of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can I argue against the words I used in 1977 which the hon. Gentleman so assiduously found by combing through the records?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, before dealing with that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>952</span>
point, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) on his speech. For the first time, a certain amount of sanity was spoken on this question. As my hon. Friend said, we are debating something set against a background of declining bus services. We are not saying what could or might happen. The fact is that bus services have declined and every known survey shows that to be the case. As my hon. Friend so rightly said, the aim of the trial area concept is to do something about that and that concept creates the conditions for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our starting point with the clause was that a three-year duration for an experiment decided upon after careful consideration would be about the right span of time. In our view, less than that would have discouraged new operators from investing in buses. Why should they bother if an area was to revert to road service licensing after, say, a year? Similarly, there would have been no point in allowing a county council to request that an experiment should stop at any time because, clearly, a county council could be under a barrage of complaints about that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend's arguments and to those of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) on the same issue, and I shall briefly state the procedure for bringing trial areas to an end. Under clause 12(4), the Minister can, after three years, vary or revoke a designation order at his discretion, and under paragraph 4 of schedule 2 the Minister must first consult the county council, and everyone else for that matter, such as district councils, neighbouring authorities and bus operators when the county council itself is notified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood both hon. Members to say that revocation could take place, first, not after three years but after two years, although my hon. Friend said that he was not wedded to that exact time, and, secondly, that revocation should be triggered by a request from not only a county council but a county council in consultation with the district council. That is basically the purport of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to my hon. Friend's arguments and those of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East and I think that they have presented a strong case, not least on the point mentioned by the hon. Gentleman at the end of his speech. Therefore, I give the Com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0522">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>953</span>
mittee an undertaking that we shall examine the arguments once more. I am persuaded by what my hon. Friend said about the importance of district councils, and the Government certainly want to do everything in their power to help district councils and to respond to genuine local feelings and the feelings of locally-elected representatives on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as a reservation, I must seek to preserve the position of the new operators who will come in, and I believe that, too, is reasonable, because in seeking to achieve the change that my hon Friend and I both want, we must have a position whereby they will have some sort of guarantee that their investment in new equipment will not be wasted. But I think that there are ways in which we can tackle that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I advise my hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman that I will gladly give an undertaking, since I recognise the strength of their arguments, that by Report we shall examine their arguments further and have talks with the Association of District Councils on the matter, with the aim of introducing an amendment to meet my hon. Friend's point. I think that that is as complete an undertaking as I can give him, and I hope that in view of that he will be content to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what the Minister has said. He told us that he will examine the amendment and he praised the speech of his hon Friend. However, is it not reasonable to suppose, if he is to examine the issue of the two-year period—or some such time—that if there is chaos and he can revoke the order, he should also say that he will look at that part of the amendment which refers to
	<br><q><p>"a county council in consultation with district councils"?</p></q>
If so, that makes a great deal of sense and gladdens my heart. It is a pity that he could not have done that in respect of amendments No. 137 and 138.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to respond to that. My hon. Friend has dealt with the previous position. I do not want to delay the Committee, but I believe that there is a difference between the application and the revocation. We are talking about the revocation of a trial area. I wish to give as much assurance as possible in respect of that. As a result, I am saying exactly what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>954</span>
the hon. Gentleman suggested. I hope he accepts that that is the Government's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for his comprehensive reply. I am extremely pleased that our probing has resulted in his offering re-examination of both the revocation period and the consultation provision. In view of that generous offer, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that I deliberately allowed a fairly wide debate on an earlier amendment. I allowed a number of preliminary remarks about trial areas, which seemed to be relevant background to the debate on the amendment. However, I would not regard it as in order for those arguments to be repeated in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. There is a difficulty of procedure. I assumed when you referred previously to the three amendments, one in the name of the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) and two tabled by the Opposition, that we should go on to discuss whether we, having tabled those two amendments, would be prepared to withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, there was only one question before the Committee, which was amendment No. 118. I said when it was moved that it would be in order to discuss the other two with it. However, the question was not put on the other two, so we are in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition will oppose the clause totally, because it is most undesirable. First, there have been several references to Judge Jeffreys in the debate. It was an aphorism of his that "Nobody shall be hanged until he has had a fair trial." That struck me from the start as the spirit underlying the consultation process in this Bill. I note that the Government have now emerged in their true colours. The Parliamentary Secretary said, "We have always been sceptical about bus licensing." If the Government had said that explicitly right at the start, we should all have known where we stood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is objectionable in principle, becuase it is the Opposition's contention
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>955</span>
that transport in no part of this country should be abandoned without regulation. That is the main point of our objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if one is in favour of roping off an area in order to let things rip—and that is the purpose of the clause—one should at least give someone the ability to step in before the transport structure of the area is torn up by its roots. The second ground for objection is therefore that the clause is characterised by almost complete inflexibility. The Minister's assurance was not strong enough in this respect. If the clause remains as it is drafted, the Government will be proceeding with a lack of elementary prudence and caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third ground for reservation and objection is that this proposal is not based upon proper democratic and consultative procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those three grounds, therefore, the clause should be opposed. I shall expand a little on each of those grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the clause is objectionable in principle. These experiments will not tell us anything that we do not know already. We can calculate what will result before we start. If the experimental areas are to be designated as a piece of practical research, the Government will preside over the disintegration of carriage services, and private investment will be attracted to the most profitable routes. A piece of research into poverty was undertaken some time ago by sociologists. The main conclusion to emerge from that research, which took several years, was that one of the factors in poverty was low wages. This will be the same type of research. We know what the result will be before it starts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More seriously, the clause will allow those county councils which have no commitment whatever to public transport to abandon their responsibilities altogether. The clause gives them 	<i>carte blanche</i> to do just that. I am sorry to say that some county councils in this country see transport obligations in an entirely partisan light. They do not see transport as a practical matter at all. To them, the motor car is a symbol of free enterprise. Along that line of political argument, they see the motor car as giving people the power and ability to stretch themselves in some kind of free enterprise way. Therefore, they invest heavily in the road budget. Public transport, however, is seen by them as Socialism, with subsidies and interventionist commitment. They see the whole
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>956</span>
picture in those stark lines, whereas both those approaches are quite wrong. The clause will open loopholes for local authorities whose expenditure per head on public transport is already low to abandon their responsibilities altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has cited the American example a number of times. In the 1960s, the United States of America did indeed let things rip. But I remind the Minister that the net result was that public transport in many areas declined almost beyond the point of reversal. Now that they face an energy crisis, the Americans have realised that the situation must be retrieved. I do not say that that will happen wholesale in Britain, but it will happen in some areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly—and I am surprised at the Minister doing this—the clause is characterised by inflexibility when it ought not to be. The previous amendments were withdrawn. The Minister gave certain assurances which I hope he will take seriously. I am sure that he will. It is a basic rule of politics that one never digs a trench from which one cannot get out. Yet that is precisely what the Minister will be doing unless he accepts the spirit of those amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An experiment is an experiment. One will look at it to see what happens. If it is failing because the area selected is wrong—it is either too big or too small, it has the wrong boundaries, it is the wrong shape or the wrong size—somebody should step in and say so, and make the necessary amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the time-scale is wrong, that should be said also, so that one has the option of varying the time-scale and the area. That strikes me as elementary prudence which should be built into the framework of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, I do not think that the consultative procedures are explicit or specific enough. In a moment we shall come to a debate on schedule 2, so we shall be able to say more about that matter then. But, in principle, since we are now debating the principle, the clause gives too much power to the county councils. I say that categorically. Their powers are not circumscribed enough. If I may sum it all up, there is no system of checks and balances in this clause, which there ought to be. We have given too much power in too many directions, and the centre of gravity is in the wrong place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How, in trial areas, is this clause to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>957</span>
be connected with section 1 of the 1978 Act, under which county councils are responsible for providing an effective system of transport? If an area where transport was breaking down were nominated as a trial area, that would surely conflict with section 1 of the 1978 Act. Another question I should like to ask is how the concept behind trial areas fits in with the three-year rolling programme of the 1978 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Politics is very often organised hypocrisy. Gone are the arguments about too much legislation going through this House. When the Labour Party was in power, there was a hue and cry about all the legislation being rail-roaded through the House. Now the boot is on the other foot. The Conservative Government are producing legislation as though they were manufacturing water biscuits, and we hear no arguments about too much legislation. I put it to the Minister, since he is clearly in a non-interventionist frame of mind, that transport has already had too much legislation in the past five or six years, and therefore he could leave well alone and drop clause 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that appeals to the Minister's mentality. I take the Conservatives' words at their face value. We have had too much legislation. Hooray! That is exactly the spirit in which the Opposition approach the clause. Let us leave well alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has blind faith in experimental areas. He ought to be more cautious. Faith, in the end, is a religious concept. If trial areas go ahead, we shall have to say prayers for private transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate to correct my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), but he misquoted the most distinguished politician born in the constituency that I represent, Benjamin Disraeli. He said not that politics was organised hypocrisy but that the Conservative Party was an organised hypocrisy. I say that for the sake of getting the record straight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two points need to be made. First, we all work in accordance with the concept of government by consent. If the measure goes through, I can think of no example in local government, or in local government law or practice, where a superior authority—the upper tier authority, a county—can select arbitrarily and without consultation a district of the county and then decide that certain provision in that district will be made
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>958</span>
entirely different and on an altogether new basis in the face of opposition from the district council. I cannot think of an example—I do not know whether any other right hon. or hon. Members can do so—where, with the aid of the Minister, it will be possible for a county council to single out a district with whose council it does not agree and impose upon that district—and that district alone—a form of provision, be it in transport, education or anything else where the elected representatives of that area are totally opposed to it. I can think of no other example that is provided under our present system of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I really do not think that the Minister has given sufficient thought to the consequences of this sort of opportunity for arbitrary intervention. I make that point seriously—rather more seriously than some others that I have made during earlier debates on these matters. I hope that they have all been serious points, but I believe that this is quite a basic point and introduces a new concept into the relationship between the two existing tiers of local government in the shire counties and central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister, even if he cannot reconsider the aspect of consultation and veto for district councils now—perhaps we cannot expect him to do that—will be prepared to reflect on this and consider the vehemently expressed views of the Association of District Councils. That body is as conservative as he is, if not more so, in both senses of the word. I believe that the Minister should reconsider the matter and come back on Report with some amendments which concede the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I take up a point which has already been touched on. I believe the words used were "strongly probing amendment". Three years is an enormously long time to allow an experiment to run, particularly when a decision might be taken in the face of the views of a district council, without it being possible for someone to say "I am sorry. There has been a bit of frost." or "It's a lash-up. We will have to give it up or in some way modify things."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three years ago, Mr. Ian Smith said that he did not envisage a black Government in Rhodesia in his lifetime. That shows the kind of changes that can take place in three years.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>959</span>
There may be a dramatic change in the circumstances prevailing in a trial area. In the case of the measure which has been discussed in the Standing Committee on the Education (No. 2) Bill, it could happen that small children between the ages of five and eight years were not getting a bus service. That is a long time to have to walk or to arrange to travel in a neighbour's car to school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is silly to proceed in this cavalier manner without giving even the perpetrator of the crime—the county council itself—some means of saying—"Even we accept that things are not working in this trial area."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman justifies the need for a period of three years on the grounds that some mythical entrepreneur will need that incentive or incitement to invest. That is all very well, but the hon. Gentleman and the Minister are not proposing any three-year trial period for municipal bus undertakings. There will be no three-year grace period in which they will be able to adjust their investment policies or their general approach. I see no reason why this terribly long period, three years, should be imposed to suit some entrepreneurs who may or may not appear when—the boot being on the other foot—there will be no three-year period to allow existing operators to prepare themselves for the introduction of the trial area. There is legitimate ground for saying that if one needs three years before one can decide whether the experiment has worked, some of the existing operators—particularly municipal operators who may have to demand large sums of money from the ratepayers if things go wrong—can equally claim that they need a period of grace in which to adjust themselves to the establishment of a trial area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not really hope that the Minister will go away and reconsider his clause. But, for the specific reasons I have given, I hope that he will think about it and possibly come back with something better and more appropriate, even within the principles of the legislation. I hope he will come back with a form of words which is more workable and more acceptable to those involved than the present clause. If he does not agree to do so, I shall join my right hon. and hon. Friends in opposing the inclusion of clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 12, dealing with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>960</span>
trial areas, is a major clause, and it is one on which there is a major difference between the two sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could argue on the Bill that the whole of Britain is to become a trial area. Apart from the special conditions in the clause 12 trial areas, there will be fundamental changes that will apply to the major parts of Britain. The legislation, once passed, will subject our whole transport system to a trial area. We differ in our views of what the consequences will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) asked what alternatives this side of the Committee would put forward. He should consider the developments of the passenger transport authority approach, where different principles have applied, very closely correlated to different political attitudes. The idea is epitomised by the case of South Yorkshire and Newcastle, and also Scotland. In those areas, a low fares policy, which is of course expensive, leads to an increase in the number of people travelling and to a greater range and network of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not suggest that that alternative is cheaper. It may well be more expensive. But we doubt that this scheme will be cheap. At the end of the day, someone will have to pick up the tab for less of a service. The consequence could well be a less well integrated service costing a great deal more. The effects of such a change will fall on the people who are least able to bear them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of our arguments. We are also identified very closely with the network planning approach, embodying the principle of cross-subsidisation. Our policies derive from those two specific principles. There is therefore a distinct difference between our attitude and the Bill, and the nature of a Committee of this kind does not allow us to spell out the alternatives all the time. As I understand it, Mr. Dean, it is my job to criticise the content of a particular clause, to attempt to amend and change it, and to address my remarks to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Labour Members must recognise that we are not primarily opposed to experiments and flexibility. In 1977, a Labour Government introduced the experimental areas legislation which allowed flexibility and certain experiments to be conducted—about 16, I think, but, of course, under much more controlled conditions. We did not leave it solely to market forces to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0526">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>961</span>
determine whether or not the service existed, as is proposed in this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it is interesting that we were unsure about the consequences of such experiments. We were not prepared to say "You will have to live with your experiment for three years." We did it the other way. We said "We shall have experiments in certain areas, and we shall control them by various committees that were set up, and we shall see what the results are." If something was to be learnt from the introduction of trial areas and experimental systems, we were, prepared to consider them in subsequent transport policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, relevant to any principle of experimental areas to take into account what was learnt from those experiments. The latest report from the TRRL has not yet reached a definitive conclusion about those experiments. Some experiments started late, and major adjustments were made to other experiments. So the conclusions of that report are not really conclusions, but indications of some kind of development resulting from the experiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was reminded of those conclusions by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch), when he said that poverty was brought about by low wages. There is a similar conclusion in the report, which says that people without cars make fewer journeys. That is a pretty obvious conclusion. In saying that, I am not being unfair to the people who conducted that research, because I know that they were trying to assess the demand for transport in the trial areas and then to differentiate between the demand from those people who had cars and from those people without cars. There is a difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I want to draw attention to an important aspect of trial areas, arising from the tentative assessment made by the TRRL research unit. One of the conclusions that we want to take into account is that it is clear from the studies—some of the studies related to car-sharing, others to buses—that, in relation to car sharing, 60 per cent. of the people using the service in the experiment did so for medical reasons. It is important for everyone, whether or not they have a car, to have access to medical treatment. Of those using the service, 30 per cent. used it for business and social reasons. As 80 per cent. of people in rural areas—in this case, the experiments were done in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>962</span>
rural areas—had cars, compared with about 65 per cent. in urban areas, there is obviously a greater reliance on cars. But we must bear in mind that those few without cars are prevented from utilising essential transport facilities for medical reasons—or even for shopping and other purposes which are taken for granted in urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting aspect which also came out of the experiments—if trial areas cover the areas used for experiments under the Labour Government, the same type of passengers are likely to be affected—is that 56 per cent. of those using some of the services were elderly people. Elderly people are, of course, less mobile. Indeed, the Minister said in an answer to a parliamentary question in July that he looked forward to an improvement in these areas by a de-licensing of the proposals. He clearly believed that that improvement would follow. I might add that that seems somewhat at variance with what has been found by many other authorities which have been investigating deprived transport areas. I am concentrating on the experimental areas that were largely rural. The county council report on rural areas, in its examination of various experiments in trial areas, makes clear that it is essential to improve and maintain the existing public transport network. That is certainly not guaranteed in the provisions for trials. One will have to take a chance that somebody will feel that services are profitable, and that they will therefore be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the conclusions of the TRRL, tentative though they are, give interesting information that seems to undermine the argument that there will be a general provision of transport, particularly for those who are without cars and therefore heavily dependent on the maintenance of public transport in some form. They are not only the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary told us that about 10 county authorities were considering applying for trial areas. He then said that two had now definitely said that they would be prepared to accept trial areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that our expectation and hope was that in the end two or three trial areas would be designated. But at present no one has reached any firm conclusions. Consultations are being carried out by a number of county councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>963</span>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fine. However, I take it that that really means the same thing, because the Minister will not be able to act without requests from local authorities. If only two apply, at least that is two out of 10. However, we shall wait to see how many actually apply. Certainly, they will be considerably fewer than those who first made an inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has not been a great deal of information about which areas are making applications. There is a great deal of confidentiality surrounding them. Presumably, that allows time for authorities to reflect on what sorts of powers and control they may have over the matter. I refer to an article in 	<i>The Surveyor,</i> in which an analysis is made of the 10 or so authorities that have actually made applications which are a matter of public record. It is interesting to note that when one compares the present proportionate spending on transport of the authorities which have applied compared to the average spent by passenger transport authorities and other shire counties, all those which have applied are the lowest per capita or proportionate spenders on transport. They are those which are not prepared to pay the money necessary to maintain a network of transport services. In the main, they are the authorities which do not treat transport as a high priority. In those circumstances there is little hope for the people who depend on some form of public transport in such areas. Therefore we have grave doubts about applications for trial areas, particularly in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also concerned about urban transport areas, as some of my hon. Friends pointed out when talking about the responsibilities of district authorities. Here, I speak from bitter experience in my own area. The Humberside authority is a county authority. Buses in the area, apart from those run by the National Bus Company, are maintained by district municipal transport undertakings. Current legislation provides that the transport supplementary grant should be given to county authorities for distribution to district authorities. However, my area has not received any money. To be an absolutely correct, I think that out of £1 million that was given to the county authority, at the end of one period £44,000 was left over, so it was given to Hull for no reason other than that it was left over—despite
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>964</span>
the fact that Hull was the district authority with the largest bus undertaking in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments were the same as those used by the Parliamentary Secretary. He said that it was an attempt to introduce efficiency. I invite him to come to Hull and look at the efficiency of the district municipal bus operator. The Parliamentary Secretary has castigated a number of district municipal bus operators without having the courage to say which ones he means. The least he could have done, particularly as a Minister, was to say exactly which district authorities he meant. I ask the Minister to visit Hull and see the problems between Hull and Humberside. He may learn a lot about the problems of district undertakings having to operate under the authority of the county council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are not, therefore, satisfied to accept that, somehow, the district authorities will simply have to consult the county authorities. If the county authorities designate that a district undertaking—for example, Hull—will become a trial area, with the profitable routes open to everyone and the maintenance of the routes on Saturdays, Sundays, or the off-peak period, left to the municipal operator, there will be an inevitable deterioration in service. That is a matter of grave concern to district operators. This view is held by both Labour and Tory controlled district operators. There are about 50 such operators which hold the same view, and they are concerned about having a transport policy imposed on their areas by the county authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, that the transport responsibility is to the county authority, but where county authorities may designate a district council area as an experimental area the differences that already exist between the county and the districts will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one takes into account, finally, the fact that the trial might be for three years, with possible deterioration, there will be extremely bad feeling between the authorities. The consumer will be far worse off with a deteriorating service, unless he is on a profitable route. At the end of the day, however, someone will have to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition rest their case on a network-service argument, which will be costly. It is interesting to note that America is now apparently prepared to move towards more control of bus services
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0528">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>965</span>
rather than leave them to private competition. Even President Carter has made clear that a public transport system must be paid for, and he hopes to find the money from the windfall profit tax on the oil companies. Since this Government are prepared, through their tax measures, to make it much easier for the oil companies to make profits, one can only assume that the ratepayer will have to pay for this reduced service. For that reason, we oppose the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Much as I am tempted to debate with the hon. Gentleman the comparison between the United States' transport system and that of this country, I will desist from doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There appears to be a slight division in the Opposition on how they regard myself and the Bill. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) regards me as Judge Jeffreys, and argues that I have some kind of fanatical intent. However, the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), who leads for the Opposition, says that the Bill is characterised by inate caution, and is timid and tentative. The Parliamentary Secretary and I agree that the best description of me would be a man of moderation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) very fairly put the division between us. The hon. Gentleman said that in no circumstances—I believe I have noted his words correctly—should an area have traffic licensing regulations withdrawn. We disagree fundamentally upon that proposition. It is only right that when we come to removing these restrictions, as he correctly points out, legislation is required to do so. I am sure he will understand that the removal of restrictions requires legislation in the same way as the imposition of them. We claim that we are moving the right way with this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trial area itself is basically an area in which there is no restriction on the number of bus services which may run. It is experimental in that I envisage only a few areas will be contained in the programme. To clear up—I hope, finally—what the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) said, we are saying not that there are two or three which have been decided upon, but that two or three trial areas will be designated. That is our intended policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 12 county councils and two Scottish regional councils have expressed real interest in trial area experiments. I am sure that members of the public in many areas that are badly served, or hardly served, by expensive and inefficient transport will welcome this proposal. But what I must emphasis again is that a trial area will not be imposed on the local population. The trial area will respond to the need of the local population, as seen and marked out by the county councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that that is sensible. We think that the present system, which is in decline, is not necessarily the one that works best, and in some cases, as is quite clear, it hardly works at all. We believe therefore, that county councils — I emphasise this — will be armed with revenue support which will enable them to secure socially desirable purposes for unprofitable routes. We feel also that there is real scope for less conventional transport in trial areas. We are talking here—this comes back to the point raised by my hon Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) and others of my hon. Friends—of a service to the general public, to the consumer, to the traveller. I understand that operators—particularly the big operators—are putting their point of view on this issue. I am thinking here of National Bus Company. I could go further, but I will not do so now. But when it comes down to it, the crucial people in the transport debate are not the operators, but the travelling public. We believe that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>967</span>
in putting forward proposals for trial areas in a few parts of the country we are adding to the options of local authorities in the provision of public transport. That is, I accept, a moderate step forward, nevertheless it is a step forward which the Committee should do well to support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
