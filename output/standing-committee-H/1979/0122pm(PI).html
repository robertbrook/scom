<div class='page-header'><h1>TRANSPORT BILL</h1></div>
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. As this is the first afternoon sitting of the Committee, it is necessary for me to make well-precedented announcements from the Chair.<br><br>
As the Committee knows, the Chairman has power to suspend the sittings from time to time, although only the Committee can decide at what time it will rise in an afternoon sitting. If our sittings should be so lengthy, either tonight or any other night, I shall ordinarily expect to suspend the Committee for dinner at about 7.15 p.m., if we have not previously adjourned, or unless I am reliably informed that the Committee is very shortly about to conclude its proceedings for the evening. In accordance with custom, this suspension will be until 8.45 p.m., with an automatic addition of 15 minutes for each Division called in the House while the Committee is suspended. Of course, in the event of Divisions taking place in the House while the Committee is sitting there will be a 15 minutes' suspension for each Division. Thereafter—that is to say, after the 8.45 p.m. resumption—I shall suspend the Committee for 15 minutes as convenient, I would suggest approximately every three hours, with a longer break for breakfast if that should ever prove necessary.<br><br>
I should tell the Committee that every member of the Committee knows more about the Bill and the proceedings than I do, I should indicate that I have scanned the <i>Official Report,</i> and the rulings which have been given by my predecessor in the Chair.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I pick up where I left off this morning, I should like to make a short statement. In response to an intervention by the Minister on a statement I was making concerning the sittings motion, I said that he had not contacted me on Friday concerning the issuing of notes on clauses subsequent to clause 3 and schedule 1. I was incorrect in saying that. In fact, there was a message from his office to mine on Friday. I want, therefore, unreservedly to withdraw my remarks and apologise to the Minister and his civil servants for any inconvenience, embarrassment or recrimination that that statement may have caused.<br><br>
We are grateful to you, Mr. Dean, for your clear guidance on the arrangements for the continuation of our afternoon sitting. It shows that some of my hon. Friends were a little over-precipitate in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0194">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 341</span>
their contingency planning in bringing their sandwiches and Thermos flasks with them this afternoon.<br><br>
This morning when the Committee rose I was referring to a proposal made to the Committee by the hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller), which seemed to have some considerable merit. I suppose that, like all great British compromises, it avoided the difficulties which arise for both sides from a proposition. He had, in fact, suggested that instead of taking completely out of the Bill the reference to a ministerial directive as to what should be the maximum fare to charge under a car-sharing arrangement, there should be left in the Bill a power to make a directive but that the Minister would exercise it only if experience of operating the Bill showed that to be necessary.<br><br>
I do not want to prolong the argument about this, as I think it was very cogently put by the hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough. But it is fair to say that the debate so far has shown that Members on both sides of the Committee have certain fears about the Government amendments Nos. 61 and 62.<br><br>
The fears run in two directions. One fear is that it may follow if the two amendments are carried that a whole series of court decisions might come about, because only courts could finally decide in the event of somebody succeeding in bringing a prosecution whether or not the charges made were legal or illegal. It is not the wish of a number of members of the Committee that that should be the case. It would have the disadvantage from the Minister's point of view that it would take away some of the flexibility which he thinks desirable.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that what the Minister wanted to see was an infinite variety of flexible arrangements. That is a beautiful phrase. It is a pity that that statement was not before us when we were debating clause 1. We could have put down as one of the objectives of the Bill the desire to bring about an infinite variety of flexible arrangements for car-sharing. But we were not given that jewel of wisdom until we came to discuss Government amendments Nos. 61 and 62.<br><br>
That is the first fear. The courts may have to make the decisions, and they may come to decisions which conflict with the Minister's own aims.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
The other fear arising from amendments Nos. 61 and 62 that has been expressed in the Committee rides the other way. It is the fear that there may be no prosecutions at all. In this area the law may be inoperable. It may be impossible to charge someone with charging more than the Minister intended that he should charge, because it may prove impossible to get a policeman to obtain evidence that somebody has charged more than he should, or to make a report that could lead to a prosecution. This point was raised by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), who illustrated the possibility in a rural area of a taxi-driver complaining that someone in the area was ostensibly operating the car-sharing provisions whereas in reality he was running a rural taxi service.<br><br>
Given those two fears, there is considerable merit in the proposition, and the Minister should consider it. He should certainly answer his hon. Friend on the proposition that there might be within the Bill a retained power to make a directive—a power that would be used only if it became apparent that the use of the power to make the directive was justified.<br><br>
By what means could that be accomplished? I have looked again, since this morning's sitting, at the drafting of the Bill. I do not think we could accomplish that aim by voting on the amendments now before us. I would suggest that if the Minister wishes to meet those of us who share this view, we should vote to carry amendment No. 61 and then, if amendment No. 62 were withdrawn, the Minister could undertake to bring in the necessary amendment to subsection (4)—particularly its reference to subsection (3)—so that the change could be effected while the Bill is in Committee.<br><br>
My main aim, however, is to deal with the Opposition amendments that have been called with Government amendments Nos. 61 and 62. Amendment No. 28 raises the difficult question of the penalties in connection with the enforcement of this part of the Bill. I think the Minister should advise the Committee on this matter. I do not think the Opposition should suggest how the law should operate. But if, from a large body of preceding transport legislation, the Minister retains the principle that to take separate fares shall not be held to be the operation of a business provided that the fares do not exceed that which is necessary to meet running
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0195">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
costs, clearly there must be some penalty for those who breach the law in that respect. Our unhappy experience in this country is that if there is no penalty for such offences, the small, persistent element in our community which reflects very badly on our generally law-abiding citizenry by persistent offences in the carriage trade will ignore it and cut right across the principle agreed by successive Parliaments that a distinction should be drawn between operating for profit and charging—as the Bill would require—in excess of what is required to recoup the running costs of the vehicle for the journey.<br><br>
Therefore, the first direct question that springs from the amendment is: What are the penalties? The amendment suggests that one might be licence endorsement, which is not uncommon for traffic offences. We do want to make much of that point, but we should like clear guidance from the Minister about the penalties that he envisages would flow from any breaches. We should also like to remind him that there are persistent breaches which can arise when penalties are not effective.<br><br>
In amendment No. 22 the issue is raised of the value of having a published scale of charges that are appropriate to the vehicle. The Minister has sought to simplify that by making clear that if he were using a directive a charge would be envisaged for a journey. That charge could be shared in any way between the passengers on the journey and so long as the aggregate fare did not exceed the charge, that would be acceptable. Under the new legislation it would be possible for a driver who wants to use the statutory provision to publish a scale of charges. To meet the Minister's objective of relating the charge to running costs, a scale would still be required, because, of course, journeys of different length would involve different charges and different fare totals.<br><br>
That brings us to the point which the hon. Member for Faversham made much of when he claimed—quite incorrectly—that the Opposition are keen to erect a whole structure of controls. However, we are keen to protect our constituents and the hon. Member's constituents from arbitrary actions by Ministers of any Government, and to retain a degree of democratic control. If the law is to prescribe that charges may be made for a certain type of operation, it is in everybody's interest that we seriously consider
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
whether that should merely be a matter of ministerial directive—which is not open to parliamentary challenge—or whether it would be an advantage in terms of accountability and of the protection of the country's citizens if Parliament could examine those charges from time to time to see whether they are right and proper in achieving the Bill's objectives.<br><br>
I make no more of the matter than that. But that is the crucial point. We have tabled an amendment which raises the possibility of doing that by statutory instrument procedure. Since we have had the merits committees, there has been no difficulty. When issues such as this have come before the House in statutory instrument, generally—I am not making a party point, because I believe that there has been common ground between Governments and Oppositions—unless they have raised extremely controversial matters, it has been possible to refer them to merits committees.<br><br>
The virtue of having a published list is that the position is made clear. People are more likely to use a legislative provision if their position is clear than if it is in doubt. If somebody can say "I have a 1500cc car, with three passenger seats and a driver's seat. Here is a provision which makes clear that I shall be operating in a completely legal way if I charge my passengers no more than 8p a mile", that makes it more likely than when they do not know whether it is legal or illegal to make that charge unless the matter is tested in court.<br><br>
Without any wish to be dogmatic or doctrinaire, I suggest that there is a balance of consideration—whether, for the purpose of achieving the Minister's aim, it is better for there to be a clear spelling out of what the scale of charges would be, or whether it is better to leave that to the court. If it is better that it be spelt out, we are left with the question whether it should be left to the Minister to make a directive or for us to retain parliamentary control by making the matter subject to statutory instrument procedure. Those are the two issues which can properly be considered in this batch of amendments against the Government's proposition in amendments Nos. 61 and 62 to withdraw the directive.<br><br>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
Amendment No. 23 requires the Minister to give his views on the appropriate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0196">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 345</span>
cost for each class of vehicle. However, I would be surprised if, in 1980, any Member of the House of Commons were to misunderstand what is meant by limits of capacity. We have been using production limits in industry for about the last 25 years—that is, limits, tolerances and allowances have commonly been used to determine methods of production. The use of such a phrase as the limit of 100 cc engine capacity either way is a simple concept to grasp.<br><br>
However, it is a serious matter. If the Minister is to have a retained directive-making power and he uses it in circumstances that the Committee would wish, or if the House of Commons were to make a statutory instrument to lay down payment limits, the question could be raised whether the ministerial directive or statutory instrument was <i>ultra vires</i> if what the Minister is seeking were not achieved—or what the Bill says should be achieved. It states that the directive that the Minister would issue should be such that it would enable only a vehicle's running costs and
<br><blockquote><p>"an appropriate amount in respect of depreciation and general wear"</p></blockquote>
to be recovered. Therefore, it would be open to anyone, on reading the ministerial directive or statutory instrument, to point to a vehicle that came within the classification but which could be run more cheaply than that, and to argue that they were <i>ultra vires.</i><br><br>
I appreciate why the Minister, on reflection, having listened to what the Opposition said on Second Reading and having read the considerable number of amendments that we have tabled with a view to demonstrating the difficulties, has decided to withdraw from the field. However, I do not necessarily accept that because it is difficult to do something it should not be done or is not worth doing. I believe that in many cases it would be worth doing. But it is important to bring out in debate the difficulties that are attached. Clearly, what is done must take those difficulties into account. They are worth overcoming, and the Minister should give us his view about that before the Committee proceeds much further.<br><br>
In amendment No. 24 we are seeking merely to make provision for parliamentary procedure, and I do not think that I need pursue that at this stage. However,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 346</span>
in amendment No. 45 we are raising the question of consultation with motoring organisations. It is quite clear that in this respect our thoughts are running in line with those of the Minister. We did not know that when we put down the amendment, but when he issued his notes on the clause they made it clear that he was leaving himself a very wide range of power of directive, to be exercised impartially, with a view to enabling him to consult appropriate people. I take it that he would accept that among those appropriate to consult on the cost of running cars would be motoring organisations—the AA, the RAC and other bodies which have given some consideration to this question. Undoubtedly they have expertise in these matters and are representative of a great number of interested motorists.<br><br>
In amendment No. 25 we are seeking to raise the question of the Minister having power to fix the same charge for journeys of different lengths. This seems to us to conflict with the principle stated by the Minister that the amount which can be collected should correspond with the cost of making the journey. If there is some way in which it can be done along the lines indicated in the Bill, we should interested to know what that is and how he would avoid the charge of acting <i>ultra vires,</i> having fixed the maximum charge for two journeys not of the same length, unless the charge which he set covered the cost only of the longer journey. That seems to me to be the only way in which he could do it. If it were done on any other basis, it could be shown that somebody could make a profit by running a shorter journey at the same charge.<br><br>
I appreciate the Minister's dilemma. He has to steer the course between breaching his principle of only allowing the recovery of the cost of the journey and, in the other extreme, deterring people from car-sharing by setting the maximum summation of fares too low. I appreciate the difficulty, but the Committee deserves an explanation of why he should put specifically in the Bill this power to fix the same charge for journeys of different lengths.<br><br>
Those are the main points raised by the Opposition amendments. I think that the Opposition have probably saved the motorist in this country from a massive increase in insurance by pursuing this matter. It is clear from what the Parliamentary Secretary said that the insurance companies were in no position to give any under-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0197">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 347</span>
taking to the Minister that, had he proceeded on his original basis, they would not have been forced to raise insurance premiums very considerably to cover against the possibility of somebody operating on this basis being held to be operating for a profit.<br><br>
The insurance companies' definition of "business" and the definition in the Bill do not necessarily have to be the same. Insurance operators have made it clear in the past that they regard certain activities as businesses. If one wants to be insured to pursue those activities, the companies will charge a much higher premium. But if the law were to allow people to charge fares for journeys, the insurance companies, in order to safeguard against second-party claims, might have to make massive increases in insurance premiums.<br><br>
Therefore I think that we have helped the motorist by bringing this issue to the fore. When we come to the appropriate new clause, we shall try to deal with the even clearer threat to motorists' insurance premiums. Insurance depends very much on whether the insurance company regards the person it is insuring as operating on a business or private basis.<br><br>
I hope that we have made clear to the Minister what our position is on this arrangement and why we feel that he has now got himself into a position where we may have the worst of both worlds—since we do not have the safeguard of the directive on the one hand or, on the other hand, the precision of definition that we need if the matter is to be left to the courts.<br><br>
We believe seriously that if the Minister rejects completely the proposition that we and one of his hon. Friends have put to him for providing a safeguard, he needs to put into the Bill a clearer definition of what can be charged.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of Transport (Mr. Norman Fowler)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first reassure the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) that in all the conversations we have had with the insurance industry, never at any stage was there a suggestion that there would be an increase in insurance premiums as a result of anything proposed either before the amendment was made or afterwards.<br><br>
However, the insurance companies said that they would like as few restrictions and regulations as possible in the legislation. That was one of the major reasons
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 348</span>
that we have moved as we have. The motor insurance industry has so advised us.<br><br>
I shall return to that in a moment. We are in some difficulty if we take the advice of outside bodies and if we take what we understood to be the advice of the right hon. Gentleman on Second Reading, because when we make the changes we are then criticised for doing so.<br><br>
We should first be absolutely clear about what the Bill does on car sharing. It does not introduce the concept of car sharing into this country. That was done by the Transport Act 1978. I must emphasise that strongly. There is no question that that was the first step along this road. The major effect of the Bill is to modify the provisions on advertising.<br><br>
The Transport Act 1978 allowed car sharing to take place provided it was not in the course of the business of carrying of passengers. It left "in the course of business" undefined. We have tried not to bring uncertainly into the Bill but to bring rather more certainty into the law by saying that "in the course of business" does not apply when the fare or the aggregate of the fares paid in respect of the journeys does not exceed the amount of the running costs of the vehicle for that journey.<br><br>
Following criticism of the 1978 Act —one or two Labour Members will remember that criticism—we have moved to bring rather more certainty than there was previously into the operation of these car sharing schemes. It may be said that we should bring even more certainty into the Bill, but let no one be under any illusions that we are introducing more certainty rather than less.<br><br>
Many of the criticisms and comments of Labour Members expressed about our proposals also apply to the 1978 Act. To leave "in the course of business" undefined could on the arguments expressed by many hon. Gentlemen, leave it vaguer than more certain. For example, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis), asked me a list of detailed questions about whether road fund tax and depreciation were included. These were criticisms that could equally have been made and are equally applicable to the 1978 Act. If he believes that those criticisms are valid, they are criticisms which go to the heart of the proposals that his Government made then.<br><br>
The crucial fact is that we are seeking to define this matter more rather than
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0198">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 349</span>
less, but even given the very broad definition used in 1978—we have checked this and I have had the opportunity this lunch time to check it again with the insurance industry—no complaints of difficulties have been made to the Department of Transport, to the motor insurance industry or to the motoring organisations. Many of the difficulties that hon. Gentlemen foresee have not taken place under the existing definition which is rather vaguer than that we are now proposing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to spell out here the differences between the 1978 Act and the Bill. But is the right hon. Gentleman aware that there is a difference in insurance premiums in those trial areas which I visted recently. One of the insurance companies imposed extra premiums on the use of those cars.</span></p>
<p>5 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but what we are talking about is the general position throughout the country. I repeat that in the talks that we have had with the insurance industry there has never been a prospect of insurance premiums going up as a result of this legislation, nor had that point been made.<br><br>
The orignal clause would have allowed actual mileage rates to be fixed as a formula with differing figures for different types of cars. If rates had been fixed the directions would have had to be varied at intervals.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has said—my hon. Friend made a fairly full speech with a full explanation of this clause some time ago—we have now had a number of consultations. I must stress that one of the most important consultations we have had is with the motor insurance industry. We studied what the right hon. Gentleman said on Second Reading.<br><br>
Although I saw that there were initial attractions—I should be less than frank if I did not say that because they are in the Bill—to the idea of prescribing actual rates, I am persuaded that this is now unnecessary and perhaps confusing, given the wide range of car types. There will, therefore, be no need to make frequent changes. The main advantage of the direction—making power has gone, and therefore the amendment proposes its deletion.<br><br>
The aim is to remove any inhibition that the motorist may have against giving other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 350</span>
people lifts and accepting contributions from them.<br><br>
The guiding principle of the legislation is to have as few restrictions as we can. Our view—it is a clear philosophical difference between us—is that we do not believe that restrictions should be imposed unless the case for them can be absolutely made out. That is clearly not the view of a number of Labour Ministers who have spoken. Indeed the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) said that it always aroused suspicion in him when a Government wanted less power. It always arouses Conservative suspicions when a Government want more power.<br><br>
I believe that we should be in danger of going down the path where the regulations deterred the would-be car sharer and that is, frankly, not what we want. We want a reasonable car-sharing arrangement for commuters which can help in the cities and towns and in rural areas where public transport is inadequate. We want to have those arrangements, as my hon. Friends the Members for Faversham (Mr. Moate) and Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) said, which make a contribution with as little red tape as possible.<br><br>
Therefore, we believe that the most sensible course is to leave the situation basically to the common sense of the public. The law will set out what features can be taken into account in assessing the charge or fare—basically the running costs of the vehicle. The charges are not to exceed the running costs. I believe that is what was meant in the 1978 Act, although it was never defined as such. The calculation of that figure will be a matter of fact. The Government will not publish a chart of charges, although organisations such as the Automobile Association make available information of that nature. It also means that in case of doubt—hon. Gentlemen are correct in this regard —the magistrates' courts would decide. A great deal of unnecessary alarm has been aroused on that point.<br><br>
I could make out a perfectly good case for saying that many courts prefer that discretion, rather than have a long list of conditions which seek to be comprehensive but can never claim to be fully comprehensive. Lord Denning said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whenever a statute comes up for consideration it must be remembered that it is not within human powers to foresee the manifold sets of facts which may arise, and, even if it were, it is not possible to provide for them in terms free from all ambiguity."</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 351</span>
Those are sensible words which certainly apply with tremendous force to car-sharing. As my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary rightly said—and he has been attacked for saying so—it must be right that there are a great variety of circumstances in which car-sharing will take place.<br><br>
The position is, therefore, that car-sharing in return for contributions is not to be regarded as a business of carrying passengers if the contributions do not exceed the vehicle's running costs for the journey. The clause also makes clear that depreciation may be included as a running cost.<br><br>
Opposition hon. Members have pointed out that different size cars mean different costs. I agree with that. To some extent everyone's motoring costs are different. That, again, is why we intend to let people work out their costs themselves instead of seeking to do it for them.<br><br>
Unlike some Opposition hon. Members, I have faith in the ordinary motorist's ability to make sensible and amicable arrangements with his passengers. I do not accept that we are abdicating our responsibilities to the courts. Motorists have, and will have, a good idea of their costs, and so will the passengers. The vast majority will not have to worry abut whether they are in the business of carrying passengers, and only those who seek deliberately to get the maximum possible from their passengers will have to tread cautiously.<br><br>
The question of insurance has also been raised by the Opposition. The facts are reasonably clear. When the Transport Act 1978 was enacted—hon. Members opposite may remember that insurance was a major point of discussion at the time—insurers gave an undertaking that private motor policies would cover motorists who shared their cars in return for contributions provided those motorists were not in the business of carrying passengers and that the contributions did not include an element of profit. The motor insurances have told us that they will be happy to retain this wording when the new legislation is in force.<br><br>
We have had a long debate, but let no one be under any misapprehension about the general position, which is that the motorist is covered when he is giving lifts. That position remains the same. There is no difficulty for him. We would not wish there to be any difficulty; we want to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 352</span>
encourage car-sharing.<br><br>
Obviously, however, if it were proved that the motorist was giving lifts as a business—and that would have to be established—different factors would apply. Under a long-standing agreement between myself and the Motor Insurers Bureau, if a driver is in breach of his policy but is liable for a claim by his passengers, compensation will be payable to the passengers by the Bureau. I can give that assurance on the point that was raised this morning. The Bureau would be entitled to seek recovery of the amount of the compensation from the negligent driver who had been in breach of his policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From the point of view of protecting the motorist, it is the case that if someone made a profit out of these journeys he would be taking himself out of cover? There have been some very dodgy motor insurance companies in the past and no doubt there will be more in the future. One can imagine some peculiar loss-adjusters arriving on the scene and turning somebody's excess of a few quid, taken over a few months, into evidence that he had been running a business. I should be grateful if the Minister could deal with that point. It is not my intention to make a debating point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point, but I thought that I had dealt with it.<br><br>
It would be for the courts to decide whether a motorist had been giving lifts as a business and making a profit. There is a wide range of cases that may be consulted. My advisers can give me case after case showing what constitutes a business in this area. If the driver were running a business, he would be outside the terms of his own insurance policy. If in that situation, for the sake of argument, one of the passengers was injured, that passenger would be insured by the arrangement with the Motor Insurers Bureau. The, person who would suffer financial damage would be the person who was in breach not only of the law but also of his insurance policy.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) also made a point about enforcement. As far as enforcement is concerned, there is no change from the 1978 Act. The police take firm action against anyone who plies for hire illegally. They do not discriminate between hire cars and private cars. In London, hire car
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0200">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 353</span>
drivers have been prosecuted under the hackney carriage and stage carriage legislation and the British Airports and railway stations may also be subject to byelaws preventing touting. But there have been very few cases of private motorists plying for hire, and I do not see why there should be a sudden increase as a result of this measure.<br><br>
There is one fundamental thing I should like to say. We have had a long and detailed debate. But there is an interesting difference between the two sides of the Committee. The Opposition have tended to put forward a negative case. They have asked whether people will be able to work the legislation out. To me and, I think, to my hon. Friends the answer is "Yes". But surely the positive way of looking at this situation and at what we are seeking to modify here to a fairly limited extent is to ask "What will the public say?" We have heard all about the interests of the motorist. If two motorists join together in a car-sharing scheme, they have opportunities of saving: they are saving in energy and congestion. I hope that this point will be taken on board by Opposition Members.<br><br>
All the negative points have now been put on car-sharing. It used to be, at any rate in principle, a matter on which the two sides of the House were not divided, that car-sharing was worth pursuing. Many of the contributions over the last few hours have suggested that that is not the case. My belief is that we now have a reasonable scheme. It is a scheme which will work and which does not require endless restrictions and regulations. I believe that the amendments that we have proposed are amendments which the Committee should support.</span></p>
<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister opened his remarks this afternoon he said that the running costs which are to be averaged or apportioned to calculate the fares are the running costs of the vehicle for that journey. The record will show that the Minister used the words "for that journey". He cannot then say that road tax is a cost of a vehicle for that journey. I make the point again, especially since the Minister did not answer any of my points this morning.<br><br>
Secondly, will the Minister accept a correction from me? He said that I put a number of detailed questions this morning
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 354</span>
such as whether road tax and depreciation were included in running costs. I did not pose those questions. We know that depreciation is included in running costs because it is mentioned in the Bill. We know—or at least we knew before the Minister just spoke—that road tax is included in running cost because the Parliamentary Secretary told us that last Thursday. I asked him whether a number of other costs would be included in the running cost, but he has mentioned none of those this afternoon. Is he unwilling or simply unable to answer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had made it reasonably clear that a portion of the road tax would be properly apportionable in the running costs of the journey. But I go back to the point that I made. The way that we are approaching this matter now is a sensible way. It is when the Hon. Gentleman comes out with all the various permutations of the various journeys that different people can make in different situations, whether urban or rural, that he underlines the wisdom of our course—not to try to lay down in this law every conceivable variation of every conceivable car-sharing scheme that we can have.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that this debate has shown whether sufficient information has been given about costs. It is a crucial part of our interpretation of this matter But the fair point being made by the Minister whether it is on reflection or with a shaft of light—he has been considering the problem of car sharing for some time as far as I am aware—concerns the probability of its enforceability. The real reason for the amendment which is before us is the difficulty of enforcement.<br><br>
The fact that we are arguing about the implications of having these clauses in the Bill about enforcement is not a criticism of ourselves. It is a reflection on the Bill. But the Minister began the debate on these amendments by saying that this is not the first time that the principle of car-sharing has been broached. That is right. Anyone reading our debates on the 1978 Transport Bill can see that we changed the schedules of the 1960 Act to make car-sharing possible and to recognise the practice already being carried out in a number of areas. We said that in our last debate in the Committee. The Minister may or may not have read that, but we recognise that that was one reason why we, in our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0201">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 355</span>
Bill, established the principle in the 1978 Act of car-sharing. But the Minister must not kid himself. I ask him to look carefully at the legislation. It is not the same. It is not simply a small extension in the advertising area. There is a fundamental difference in approach. My right hon. Friend and I had the job of explaining that the party position is different to what Labour Ministers were saying previously. It is true that we had to say something that seemed to be somewhat different. Indeed, it was different from policy being pursued previously. That is always the time for Oppositions to reconsider their policies.<br><br>
But as regards car-sharing, the distinctive difference between the two parties was that we were not prepared to allow this provision to become a means by which touts or pirates could engage in competition with legitimate business traffic. That is basically one of the points.<br><br>
The difficulty is. How do we draw the line between those two operations? That is where the difficulties begin. We were prepared to say that because of the difficuties involved in controlling this we would have to try to limit the areas for car-sharing. Anybody looking at the 1978 Act could see that limitations are imposed in the use of car-sharing facilities, certainly in respect of advertising. We made it clear that only in certain cases, such as people sharing a car and travelling to the same place of work could one advertise, and than only in limited areas, in a periodical or in a club's activities and that the journey itself should be involved in the activities of that work or that club.<br><br>
Those were limited areas, by which we were prepared to allow advertising in the most limited form against opposition from many people, who share our views politically, who felt that it would then be used as the kind of Trojan horse that the Minister is now readily showing us in that he would now employ this principle on a broader scale. We certainly restricted it, and not only did we define it in our law, but we imposed on it by local authorities and the commissioners to assess whether the advertising or the service was a commercial activity in itself. We had a body to which we could refer to make a decision whether the act of car-sharing was one with commercial intent. That body could stop the advertising and the advantage of the use of car-sharing<br><br>
So in many regards our 1978 proposal was much more limited. True, it was a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 356</span>
breach in the the principle of car-sharing, but we also made one other condition, about which the Minister has said very little today. In those debates, which I have since read, it was made clear when he was being pressed for a wider provision of car-sharing that the Government at that time were prepared to consider it in a broader scale in trial areas. We were prepared to try it in areas where it could be used for hospital and rural services. In the trial areas it was under the control of the commissioners amd the local authorities. So controls were always involved.<br><br>
That is the essential distinction between us. We were prepared to allow car-sharing for social activities or for picking up people going to the same factory or going from a club on a tennis outing, or whatever it might be. But we imposed control, which we gave to authorities such as traffic commissioners. The difficulty for the Minister is that he has abolished all that in his Bill. Let us not be told of the difficulties of control if the existing controls on car-sharing are withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Gilroy Bevan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member explain, at some length, his defence of the totalitarian powers that the commissioners use without ever having been elected and without reference to any authority but themselves?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope the hon. Gentleman will not be tempted to deal with that point on this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to hear the hon. Member's views on the House of Lords. The commissioners were exercising their powers under the Act. Anybody can see those powers, and if the House of Commons wants to change the powers of the commissioners, it can do so. The Bill says that the commissioners, will no longer have those kinds of controls in regard to car-sharing. The hon. Member thinks that the commissioners may have been dictatorial, but I do not accept that. But one thing is very clear. It is a control that we had, but the Government do not have it and now have the difficulties of explaining that they do not want car-sharing to be used for business. They do not want car sharing to be use in the true sense of hire and reward to make profit in the sense that it is a commercial activity. That is still the Government's position as I understand it. Basically, the amendments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0202">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 357</span>
take out the possibility that the Minister will give a direction.<br><br>
As I understand it, it will still be an offence to make a profit from the action. That offence will be determined by the magistrate's court. Will the Minister intervene and tell us what the penalties are? Presumably they are similar to the penalties that would apply to anyone carrying out a car-sharing business, which is prohibited under present legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Basically the fine is £200—double that which applied in 1978.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to think how a complaint would come to the magistrate's court. It would not come from the driver himself. It might presumably come from someone competing with him in car-sharing, who says that he is charging too little or too much. I do not know how a complaint would arrive at the magistrate's court. I am not being pernickety about it; I am just trying to think. Will the Minister—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Someone in that situation would be prosecuted for driving without a road service licence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, because he is engaging in commercial activity.<br><br>
Presumably someone who felt that he were being undermined by such activity, presumably another taxi driver, or taxi company or bus company—or the police—would have to tackle the enforceability problems, such as those that exist with touts at Heathrow airport. Irrespective of what the Minister may say about byelaws for Heathrow, he knows that the problem continues despite the law. The tout may well now be able to claim that he is car-sharing and not out for commercial business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see why it is nonsense. To say so is to presume that the man will be able to get less money under the provision than he can negotiate at present. He could charge far higher rates than taxi drivers, who are controlled by the hackney cab regulations. Enforceability is the problem. Is the driver to be followed to the end of his journey in order to find out what he has charged? That is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 358</span>
exactly the sort of problem which exists at present. There is tremendous difficulty in enforcing controls on the car-sharing business.<br><br>
Advertising, whether on likes it or not, is a major form of touting for business. But in this case it will be touting for car-sharing, which will not be considered business even if a profit is being made in certain circumstances. The House will not define those circumstances, but will leave it to the magistrate's court to define a profitable or non-profitable situation. I presume, although I do not know, that there is considerable case law on the subject. One imagines that there are considerable complaints at present about the magistrates' courts' interpretations of offences and penalties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barry Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can draw a parallel between the proposed legislation and the legislation affecting private hire drivers. In the latter case it has initially been left to the licensing panel of local authorities, and thereafter to magistrates on appeal, to decide who shall be a suitable person to be a private hire driver. That was not defined precisely.<br><br>
I have appeared many times at such appeals and, indeed, before licensing panels. The system works pretty well. Magistrates deal with appeals on the facts. That is what I understand the Minister to be advocating. I believe that the Opposition are inventing difficulties that do not exist.<br><br>
At this stage I express my gratitude that at last we have started to talk about transport. Before Christmas I thought that we should never talk about anything but Christmas. The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) was talking about conversations he had with odd people in bus queues. This is an interesting debate, but it seems to me that the philosophical angle of right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite is towards—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon Gentleman but this is supposed to be an intervention and I hope he will keep it brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is one of my shorter interventions, Mr. English. I shall do my best, in future, to extend them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point must be taken, whatever the character of the debate, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0203">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 359</span>
it has to be in order as the Chairman so defines. Perhaps our debates on transport might be all the better if we have these interventions from people who have experience, as the hon. Gentleman has shown, in the magistrates' interpretation of previous legislation. Indeed, the case he has given is one of the reasons for our great concern. The reason we gave local authorities power to deal with private hire cars was that they were undermining legitimate taxi business. The power enabled local authorities to determine where the area of legitimate activity started and finished. Not all local authorities implemented the power, however. But that was another example of controls being implemented.<br><br>
There has been reference to the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1966. That brings us to the other distinctive difference between us. We are both agreed that people involved in car-sharing should not make a profit. The difference between us is the form of control. We were prepared to use the traffic commissioners or local authorities, a combination if necessary, but not necessarily to have to rely on the magistrates' courts, which is what the Government are prepared to do in an area which, if successful, will be open to thousands more motorists being involved when they are not too sure what is legal or illegal.<br><br>
It is all right the Minister saying that we can rely on motorists' good sense, but many citizens would like some clear guidance on what is legal. It is doubtful enough, even with present legislation, to be told that the Minister will be giving an</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 3, line 14, after "journey", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"a list of which is prominently displayed inside the vehicle".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall discuss amendment No. 29, in page 3, line 20, at end insert—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 360</span>
<p>indication of costs and have it left to the magistrates' court to decide whether a particular cost imposed or incurred made a profit for the motorist concerned.</p>
<p>We are opposed to the two Government amendments. We understand the Minister's difficulties, but that is where he begins to move away from the controls embodied in the 1978 Act.</p>
<p>I was stopped on the point that I raised on trial areas. As I understand it, the previous Government had trial areas to experiment with various car-sharing schemes, obstacles and bus routes, again under the control of local authorities and the traffic commissioners, with the aim of making a report. The possibilities were that if those reports were successful the Government would consider whether the scheme was valuable to extend. But the Minister has not yet informed the Committee—I do not know whether he has the information—of the contents of the reports from the trial areas about the success of car-sharing.</p>
<p>The Labour Government's position at that time was consistent with what we have been saying today. We believe that this is a huge loophole, will lead to the development of a private hire system, and will reduce the taxi services to a great extent, so that many will be encouraged to seek this system as a means of dealing with their commercial business.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 8.</p>
<p><br><blockquote><p>"(3B) Taking fares for a journey in a vehicle operating under the provisions of sub-section (2) and (3) of this section without prominently displaying inside the vehicle a list of the running costs of the vehicle shall be an offence, for which the driver's licence can be endorsed.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was under the impression, having been very much misled by the wording in clause 2, that the list of directions as to the running costs of vehicles for journeys on a car-sharing basis
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0204">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 361</span>
would be determined by the Minister. Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 take this part out of the Bill.<br><br>
I am concerned at the Minister's lack of consistency and his ability to change policies almost overnight, and wonder at the situation whereby it was originally considered by him appropriate to have a list of directions and now he considers it is inappropriate. I wonder what his position on this will be before the finish of the Bill and whether he will revert to his original intention, which certainly had much more to commend it.<br><br>
I presume that there is such a list of directions of costs in existence. I cannot accept that it was because there was no such list that the provision was deleted from the Bill. If such a list was prepared, where is it now? How can we find out what it contained? When will it be made available to us? What is there to hide? I hope that the Minister will answer these questions.<br><br>
I contend that if it is in the public interest to have a list of charges displayed inside taxicabs and a scale of fares displayed inside motorbuses, surely it is equally in the public interest to have a list of the running costs of any vehicle involved in any car-sharing scheme displayed prominently in the vehicle. It is even more in the public interest when one considers that a substantial proportion of the people participating in car-sharing schemes will probably be people who do not have a car of their own and, as such, have no proper idea of what the running costs of a car may be.<br><br>
This is a reasonable amendment which I urge Tory hon. Members, particularly from rural areas, to support as being of benefit to their constituents as well as being something that could help to make the concept of car-sharing more successful than might otherwise be the case.<br><br>
I am opposed to the principle of car-sharing, for I believe it inevitably weakens the provision of public transport services. But I have to accept the fact that it is there and will continue to be there. Therefore, I believe that it should be made to operate fairly and be seen to operate fairly. One of the best ways of achieving this aim is to insist that any vehicle being used on a car-sharing basis should have a list of the running costs of that vehicle prominently displayed inside it. It need be only a relatively simple list such as, for example,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 362</span>
giving a cost per mile and one-tenth of a mile as car speedometers work in tenths.<br><br>
It is a simple matter to check the speedometer at the start and finish of the journey and work out the cost to be paid by the passenger or passengers. It is a relatively simple matter for the passenger to decide, even before making the journey, whether he or she is willing or able to pay the costs being asked. If the point were to be made that it would be difficult for individuals to work out running costs, I should say that the reverse is true.<br><br>
The Minister has already stated that motoring organisations such as the Automobile Association and the Royal Automobile Club are able to provide figures giving running costs. I am sure that consumer organisations could also do that. The Transport and General Workers Union cab section in April 1979, in a survey submitted to the Price Commission, gave a detailed breakdown of the costs of running a taxi. As a matter of interest, that survey showed that at that time London's taxi fares should have been about 45p per mile.<br><br>
The Government and local authorities are able to lay down what mileage rates should be charged by elected members and officials using their own cars for the purpose of performing their duties. I believe that the Department of Transport can also work out these costs, and, therefore, I see no justifiable reason for not accepting the amendment.<br><br>
In fact, in order to comply with the requirement in the Bill that the total amount charged did not exceed the running costs for the journey made, and in order to prove that no profit was made, a person operating a car-sharing scheme would have had to have worked out his running costs beforehand. Therefore, it is a simple matter for any individual operating a vehicle on a car-sharing basis to display a list of the running costs of his vehicle. The only reason for not doing so would be to mislead the passengers in his vehicle as to the true running costs of his vehicle, and to make a charge which would result in a profit to the operator. That would be against the spirit and intention of the Bill, and also against the law.<br><br>
The amendment, and amendment No. 29, would have the effect of making a would-be offender think twice before failing to display a list of running costs. The honest car-sharer has absolutely nothing to fear. It is the would-be rogue who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0205">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 363</span>
stands to be penalised by this amendment, and that is how it should be.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis) so excellently put it earlier, it is unfortunate that people will seek to find loopholes in legislation, but it is not our duty to make it easier for them to do so. Yet here we have a Bill through which a horse and cart can be driven, never mind a car on a car-sharing basis. The unscrupulous person will find it very easy to make a profit out of the Bill. In fact, some people will make a whacking great profit from it, at the expense of the public transport system in many areas.<br><br>
These amendments, while not making the Bill watertight and free from loopholes on the costs of car-sharing, will at least make it more difficult for the would-be profiteer and may well act as a deterrent as well as make the persistent offender liable to lose his driving licence under the totting up system. The amendments will, therefore, offer some protection to the consumer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In moving the amendment in otherwise very reasonable terms, the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) said at one stage that he was opposed to the concept of car-sharing. He did not qualify that in any way. We fear that there are some Opposition hon. Members who share that view. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will qualify his statement by saying that he is against car-sharing when it is operated in a commercial or profit-making way. I hope that as far as the bulk of the Committee, and the House, is concerned we can retain some general agreement on aims.<br><br>
It is not the Government's intention to encourage the bogus taxi firm, the fringe car hire firm, or the private motorist who plies for hire to earn extra money in the evening. We are anxious to reassure the taxi and hire car trade and public passenger vehicle operators that we have no intention of legislating in a way which will encourage or facilitate that kind of fringe commercial activity. We are hoping to encourage the non-profit-making, noncommercial private motorist who wishes to share his motor car.<br><br>
I take up what the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 364</span>
said in his last contribution. Basically, what we are deciding is: how does one draw the borderline? How do we draw up legislation which gives the maximum flexibility and freedom to the honest motorist who wants to make more intelligent and sensible use of his motor car, or that of his friend and neighbour, without at the same time opening up loopholes which can be exploited by the illegal taxi operator?<br><br>
The difficulty, if one is not careful, is that one can begin to frame legislation in such a way that inhibits or restricts the activities of the tout and the illegal operator but actually brings into the Bill provisions which are useless and inappropriate and an encumbrance for the ordinary motorist.<br><br>
The amendment proposes an arrangement which will be ridiculous in practice for the ordinary non-commercial private motorist making an informal car-sharing arrangement between himself and his neighbours and friends.<br><br>
In our debates so far we have been concentrating on the possibility of an illegal fringe. But what we are largely catering for in the Bill is the vast majority of honest car-sharing arrangements, some of which are made in advance, some not, which are informal agreements between the driver and his passengers about dividing up the costs for a journey which all of them want to make using one motor vehicle. There would be absurd results if it was not possible to enter into an informal car-sharing arrangement without putting inside the vehicle a list of the running costs relating the charge made to those running costs.<br><br>
5.45 p.m.<br><br>
In a previous debate I gave an example of two people going fishing together. But there are endless examples which arise in practice where people make arrangements to travel to work together in the same car. They offer neighbours a lift on the basis that the cost is divided between them. It is possible that the hon. Member for Shettleston and myself, and perhaps one or two colleagues, might find ourselves stranded here in the small hours of the morning, and one of us with a car might agree to make a round trip to drop us all off. If the passengers were generously to offer to contribute towards the cost of the petrol is it suggested that the driver should be guilty of a criminal off-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0206">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 365</span>
ence, as proposed in amendment No. 29, for entering into such an arrangement without having a list of the costs prominently displayed inside his vehicle?<br><br>
That is a frivolous example, which was the first example that came to mind, of an informal, without notice, car-sharing arrangement. If one applied the amendment to that sort of arrangement one would be creating a criminal offence in ridiculous circumstances, which would carry with it the additional penalty of an endorsement on the driver's licence. That would be too onerous a provision.<br><br>
I believe the amendment is an attempt to go back to the substance of what was debated at considerable length on the previous group of amendments. In that debate we completely covered the difficulty of how one defines what is profit-making, what is commercial and what is levying fares that amount to less than the running costs of the vehicle for a specific journey. In practice, that will be left to the common sense of the people involved in the arrangement, and I do not believe that we should hedge it about with the requirements proposed in the amendment.<br><br>
The amendment would bring in a totally fresh restriction on the ability to share a private car for a common journey. It would be the opposite direction to that in which I hope the majority of hon. Members on the Committee would like to move.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear that we could continue to debate the differences between both sides on this principle, and neither side is apparently trying to convince the other of its point of view, except in relation to whether the legislation is enforceable. There has been some listening, but that has not solved the Opposition's problems on the clause.<br><br>
I take the principles put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary in reply to my hon. Friend's proposal for a list of the running costs to be displayed in a vehicle engaged in car sharing. The answer was given, as usual, in the form of an example—that if a number of hon. Members wanted to get together in the House at two or three o'clock in the morning to share a car, and the driver was to deviate from his normal route in order to drop off each hon. Member at his destination, that would be a car-sharing arrangement. Such
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 366</span>
an arrangement was envisaged under the previous legislation and, therefore, in principle there is no difference.<br><br>
However, there is an essential point which the Parliamentary Secretary must recognise since he claimed that the government had assured the taxi industry—I see his name on a letter dated 14 December to the taxi industry—that it is not the Government's intention to encourage the carrying of passengers on a business basis through the car-sharing provision. In that letter he says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is certainly not our intention to condone touting by the drivers of unlicensed vehicles: this will remain illegal, and the police will continue to enforce the law in this respect."</p></blockquote>
The Parliamentary Secretary may be satisfied that there are only a few lawbreakers and that we should be concentrating on the majority of people, but he will have to take into account the legitimate concern of the taxi industry, which feels that its charges must be determined by another authority—in this case not by the driver, because that would be illegal under these circumstances.<br><br>
I want to take the example that the Parliamentary Secretary gave of the difficulties of having lists of charges in cars. That is not an argument against having lists, it is purely one of convenience. The Parliamentary Secretary said that if a number of hon. Members wanted to share the costs of a car, that is usually thought to be a petrol charge. But under the circumstances that we are considering it will not be simply a petrol charge. Four people in a car at £1 or more a gallon can easily assess roughly a fair charge for sharing that car.<br><br>
My hon. Friend's amendment seeks to give some indication of the scale of charges that would be considered fair for the driver to ask of those who are sharing the car. Depreciation and other costs are now to be included in the charge for car sharing and these factors take the cost up from the 10p, 20p or 30p each for sharing a car on say, a five-mile journey to Clapham, where I live, so that the cost becomes considerably greater.<br><br>
That is when we begin to enter into difficulties in regard to those who offer terms on a commercial basis—namely, the licensed taxi trade. Its charges are sometimes posted in the cab and sometimes shown on the meter, but they are evidence of the charges that may be imposed by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0207">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 367</span>
driver in providing that commercial service from A to B. The problem of the licensed trade in determining the charge is that it is usually considerably less than the cost of a private hire. Indeed, in London at present we are finding the anomaly that a taxi driver will refuse to take someone from here to Clapham because he says that the fare that he is allowed to charge under the fares agreed with the Home Office does not enable him to make him much money, because normally late at night he cannot get a fare back, which is a consideration for him. But a private hire merchant will offer a ride for which he charges twice as much, which the hackney cab cannot do.<br><br>
All that this provision will do is to increase the opportunities for the social car arrangements to undermine use of taxis. My hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston was saying that the Government believe that an extra amount of profit should be charged, should the person in the car not also be able to understand what that charge should be, because we are going far beyond the cost of petrol? It seems that the Minister is not convinced of any argument. It is another example of "greater freedom".<br><br>
Without doubt, even with the Minister's own example, the provision will undermine the existing, legitimate cab trade, whose charging of fares and the number of people who can travel in a cab are controlled by the Government—in London, by the Home Office. The cab trade does not have the same consideration that is offered to car-sharing and will find its position undermined.<br><br>
It is remarkable that such a provision comes from a Government who to say that they are the friend of the small business man. I remember in the past year or so getting in taxis, when one could get them to go to the station, and the taxi driver saying "I shall be glad when you lot are out and the other lot are in". I do not know whether the taxi driver will feel the same after this legislation, but when I get in a cab I always do my little exercise and say "Have you heard what the Government will be doing to the taxi trade?" It remains to be seen what will happen in the next 12 months to the taxi drivers' attitude. The Parliamentary Secretary's replies are no justification for not accepting our amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Mem-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 368</span>
ber saying that he contemplates a list of charges in the usual, informal car-sharing situation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could refer to our past legislation, in which there was no requirement that lists of charges should be available even in those areas where we considered that car-sharing would be allowed. However, we had the commissioners to assess the charges and to decide whether advertising in those situations made possible charges that brought about a commercial gain. That is the distinctive difference between us.<br><br>
If the controls or the body that makes the assessment are removed, as they are under the Bill, we are forced to use other measures, as the Home Office has been under a number of Governments. When the meters cannot be changed in time, a list of charges is put in the car to protect the consumer. In this case, if the Government wish—as indeed they do—to protect people who have come to an arrangement for car-sharing, and to prevent them from being exploited, I do not see the difficulty. If the Minister is prepared to think out what the charges should be, why should he not indicate to the people offering the service that he wants to encourage them to do so?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Parliamentary Secretary finds himself in odd circumstances as a result of the proposal before us and as a result in particular of my hon. Friends amendment. It is becoming increasingly clear that to introduce the scope of advertising set out in part IV of schedule 1 without any other controls and not on any experimental basis would be to turn the car-sharing concept into something different from a casual arrangement with neighbours. It is because the extensions proposed, not being on an experimental basis, are no longer in the same category as the casual arrangement with workmates or neighbours that we feel more regulation is necessary in order to protect the passengers and also the existing operators who might carry such people if these proposals did not become law.<br><br>
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will deign to listen for half a second. His response to the points made by my hon. Friend the member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) was to the effect that this will be not a formal but a casual
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0208">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 369</span>
arrangement. But the arrangements foreseen in part IV of schedule 1 are not casual. Those arrangements may be advertised in a place of worship, a place of work, a club or a voluntary association. Beyond that, they may be advertised in a periodical circulating to persons who might be in the place of worship or place of work. One-off, temporary arrangements will not be advertised.<br><br>
Some of the advertisements might have to be paid for. These arrangements will be fairly permanent. Someone will terminate his existing arrangements for getting to work and shift into a car-sharing arrangement only if he is certain that the new arrangement will continue for a considerable period. I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary that if someone is going to wait until his season ticket expires, for instance, and transfer to a car-sharing arrangement as a result of an advertisement he has seen in the house magazine where he works, he is committing himself. [An hon. Member: "Nonsense."] Anyone who says that statement is nonsense cannot have been listening. Someone changing his travel arrangements in this way is committing himself. He may give up his existing season ticket or even some other car-sharing arrangement in order to adopt a system he regards as beneficial. In those circumstances, it seems reasonable that a degree of formality should enter into the arrangement.<br><br>
What the Parliamentary Secretary was saying—there is some truth in it in regard to existing car-sharing arrangements—is that the arrangement is not so formal. Three or four people get together and say, "Your petrol costs work out at about £3.80 a week and we'll give you a few bob for your trouble. Let's make it a fiver a week".</span></p>
<p>6 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is labouring under a misapprehension, I think, in part. The part of schedule 1 to which he is referring does not apply to private car-sharing arrangements. It only applies to commercial undertakings. It defines something set out in part I and part III of schedule 1, that is, the
<br><blockquote><p>"Sharing of Taxis and Hire-Cars"</p></blockquote>
and other commercial arrangements, and will only be relevant when we reach clause 3.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 370</span>
The amendment covers the whole of car sharing, whether it is advertised or not. Even though we are facilitating advertising, only a tiny proportion of car-sharing arrangements will follow from advertisements being posted anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Parliamentary Secretary had not been talking to one of his colleagues, he would have heard earlier when I said that we ought to distinguish between the form of casual car sharing which has prevailed to date and the rather more formal form of car sharing which will result from a wider process of advertising. I agree that we do need to make that distinction and I think that that was the distinction he was making, in his own way.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary is saying that the present arrangements are very casual and that the sums arrived at may be rather fag packet-type calculations and fares, but the sums of money obtained from fellow passengers—if that is not an overtone—might be rather casually worked out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the matter with that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am about to go on to say, what is the matter with that? I made an inquiry regarding the chap who includes an item for profit in the sum he charges his fellow travellers and his position in relation to insurance cover. I did not think that I got a satisfactory answer from the Minister, who was concerned with the other three or, possibly, seven other passengers in the vehicle. I am also concerned for the driver, because, as I understand, if he makes an element which can be identified as profit, a sum in excess of the running cost of the vehicle, and so on, he takes himself outside normal insurance cover. It seems to me that, in these circumstances, the driver entering into a casual arrangement—and, generally, they are casual arrangements—is carrying himself into danger, particularly with some of the near-beer insurance companies which do not like meeting claims.<br><br>
The answer given by the Parliamentary Secretary to my hon. Friend the Member for Shettlestone bears out my fears about what will happen to the insurance cover of the driver who, with the best will in the world, and with the agreement of every-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0209">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 371</span>
body concerned, pops in 50p per person per week, or 50p a day for that matter, on top of his running costs "for your bother", which is a term used. We have not had a satisfactory answer on that, and if the Minister is saying that arrangements are casual, they are open to that criticism and to that danger for drivers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments embody our main concern, which is, having passed legislation, how, in effect, do we monitor it? It is all very well for the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to repeat that this is not a problem, that "This is just among friends" and so on. Let us take the other side of the coin. If it is just among friends, than one does not need to advertise. We have already been over that, so we will leave it for the moment. But how, in effect, does one legislate for the odd guys who are determined to back not a horse and cart but a bus through this legislation.<br><br>
In effect, we are saying in amendment No. 29 that there must be some method of making someone accountable if he goes against the Minister's intention that he does not make a profit. What is wrong with that? Both the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary have repeatedly stated—and I fully accept what they say—that it is not their intention that those offering to share their cars should not make a profit. I believe that they are sincere in that. We believe that there should be a penalty if the drivers contravene the Government's intention.<br><br>
Would there be anything wrong if they displayed inside the vehicle a list of the running costs, because they would not have the benefit of a ministerial directive? That has been lost, it is sad to relate. I am sure the Committee agrees that, in the interest of those who operate such an arrangement—I am not talking about a friend from next door or just down the street—we must consider the question of advertising.<br><br>
If one operates the arrangement only among friends, there is no need for advertising. However, once one has advertised, one goes beyond the realm of friends in the same street travelling together. In that case, we lay ourselves open to those who seek to exploit the position.<br><br>
Either one accepts that argument or one does not. If one believed that everyone—both inside and outside the House of Commons—is a saint who has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 372</span>
descended from on high, one could leave the legislation as it is. However, if one believes—as I do—that some people will sit day and night looking for loopholes in the law, as legislators we must try to make the loopholes as narrow as possible. I fully accept that they will never all be closed, because if that happened there would be no need for lawyers. I have nothing against lawyers—without any shadow of doubt, they serve a useful purpose.<br><br>
If the Government accept my view that not all people are plaster saints, what is wrong with putting in some form of penalty for those who contravene not only the Bill but also the wishes of the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, as freely expressed here? Wishes are one thing, but to translate them into a tangible form whereby there can be punishment if they are transgressed against is a different matter.<br><br>
Should someone transgress in such a manner that his driver's licence is endorsed, surely that is only a minor punishment. After a period the endorsement lapses. If someone goes against the intentions of both the Ministers—although the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary may tell us there is no wish for a profit—what would be the recourse if it were established that a profit was, in fact, being made. The aims of amendment No. 29 are twofold. One is the displaying inside the vehicle the list of running costs. The other effect would be that anybody stopping the vehicle would have ready access to those costs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say "anybody stopping that vehicle"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should again like to make clear that the Bill does not facilitate plying for hire. It would be illegal for a vehicle to stop and for a fare then to be arranged. That is exactly the sort of illegal taxi operation that none of us wants. It is covered by clause 2(3)(<i>b</i>) which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the arrangements for the payment of fares by the passenger or passengers so carried were made before the journey began".</p></blockquote>
So, unlike plying for hire, car-sharing would be legal only if before a car set off on a particular journey arrangements for fares had been completed. Illegal plying
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0210">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 373</span>
for hire is something that we are anxious to cut out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the wrong point. I take what the Minister says. There is no difference between us on that matter. The amendment seeks to ensure that running costs will be displayed. Let us suppose that four people are travelling together under a car-sharing scheme and a policeman stops them, as he is entitled to do. How does he monitor whether the four have agreed a fare beforehand?<br><br>
If he has received no direction from the Bill in respect of costs, how does he know whether a profit is being made? The only way in which that will be known is by having the running costs displayed in the vehicle. If that is not sufficient, at least it is a start. Any policeman asking what fare has been paid and making a mathematical calculation based on the running costs might then say "On your way. You are not breaking any law," or, since no such law will exist, perhaps he would say "You are not contravening what the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have expounded time and again, and you are not making a profit."<br><br>
The other point is that if there is such a list inside the car to show running costs, which will indicate whether a profit is being made, that will still not be enough. What happens if the amendment is passed, there is a list of running costs and a policeman stopping the car finds that the owner is disobeying the wishes of the Minister? If there is no penalty, how can the Government say—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerry Neale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like the hon. Gentleman to clarify a point. The amendment seems to make a requirement that a vehicle's running costs be displayed for an agreed journey. The Opposition seem to be addressing their point to the displaying of the vehicle's general running costs, but that would not be the effect of their amendment. To have that effect the words in the amendment would need to be inserted after "vehicle" rather than "journey". As it is, the amendment seeks to provide for a list of running costs for every journey that is made, which is absolute nonsense. As the Ministers have made plain, one simply cannot make that calculation, because no two journeys are made in the same circumstances.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 374</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fowler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is also right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That does not necessarily mean that the amendment is bad.<br><br>
We were previously talking about four or five people getting together to go to the factory, or wherever. There would be a running cost for that journey. Or are we now implying that car sharing goes beyond what has been described? If it does, what the hon. Gentleman has said is perfectly correct. But if it takes place only in the context described by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary—that of two or three people getting together to share a journey—that is a different matter.<br><br>
6.15 p.m.<br><br>
Why is it not possible to have a list of running costs, as proposed by the amendment? If car sharing is to get out of hand, there will indeed be great difficulty. But I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say that car sharing is what happens when people who share a similar journey band together.<br><br>
With a similar journey—even if there are more than one or two journeys—is it not possible to have a list of running costs? If that is not possible, how is the Parliamentary Secretary to monitor in the interests of the public the observance of what he has repeatedly stressed—"thou shalt not make a profit on car sharing". In effect he is saying that it cannot be monitored. He will rely on individuals, out of the goodness of their hearts, not to make a profit. If he believes in that, he should put something in the Bill to give meaning to his words, and also provide for the punishment of anyone who breaks the rules. I should like him to tell the Committee, and through the Committee the public, how he intends to monitor the observance of his clear intention that no profit should be made, without either knowing the running costs of the vehicle or having an offence with which to charge someone guilty of making a profit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall do what I can to take the matter further. I am not sure that I can add a great deal that will not merely go round the same course again. I am afraid that we are not drawing much nearer to agreement, particularly with the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull. East (Mr. Prescott). However, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0211">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 375</span>
shall make one final attempt to shed light on the effects of the amendment as I see them.<br><br>
There does not appear to be a great distance between the two sides of the Committee in principle. We are both concerned about how to cut out the illegal taxi operator without putting unreasonable restrictions on private car sharing. First, let us make clear what is to be monitored. It is true that the Bill as a whole makes changes in advertising arrangements. But the subsection covers every kind of car sharing arrangement, whether advertised or not. At one extreme is the type of very informal arrangement that has been described, which is cooked up between people in a vehicle who at five minutes' notice suddenly decide on a good arrangement for going off somewhere. At the other extreme is the comparatively formal arrangement between two or three people who have come together as the result of an advertisement in a shop window and entered into a firm agreement about sharing costs. The subsection covers the whole spectrum.<br><br>
The amendment would impose the need to display a list of running costs for the journey over that whole spectrum, and for each journey made. My hon. Friend the Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale) made a valid point. The amendment would require a list of the vehicle's running costs for the journey to be displayed. The difficulty here is not only the nature and variety of car sharing arrangements, but that the running costs of a vehicle will vary according to the journey being undertaken. The petrol consumption of a car will vary according to whether the car is travelling through congested urban streets or making a long-distance journey at cruising speeds. One must bear in mind such variations in the running cost of a journey.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is quite right. If this amendment were applied, before any car-sharing could be entered into a list of the runnings costs of that particular journey, which might vary from time to time, would have to be displayed in the car before any car-sharing could be entered into.<br><br>
There are regular car-sharing arrangements. Of course we are contemplating regular car-sharing. The amendment is not confined to regular car-sharing, but among the whole range of arrangements to which this clause refers there will be,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 376</span>
for instance, groups of people regularly travelling from their place of work to their homes. There is also the social car-sharing of the WRVS, which arranges journeys for the inhabitants of a village. The WRVS voluntary driver may take his or her passengers on a variety of different journeys on a regular basis. The cost of the journeys may vary according to whether the driver is taking the elderly inhabitants of the village into the nearby city to shop or is just going down the road. I hope that we have illustrated that fact that—as my hon. Friend the Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale) underlined—we are dealing with a huge range of situations. It is not right to speak as though this amendment would apply only to the very formal arrangements which resemble hire car or taxi businesses.<br><br>
Clause 2 applies to the whole range of car-sharing arrangements, 99 per cent, of which will be of the informal, person-to-person type. That is the subject-matter we are contemplating. What are we monitoring? The aim of the clause is to define those journeys which are not journeys made in the course of a business of carrying passengers. So long as the amount paid in fares does not exceed the running costs, the driver is not carrying passengers as a business. If the amount paid in fares exceeds the cost of the journey, the arrangement may constitute a business of carrying passengers, especially if it is undertaken with any degree of regularity.<br><br>
The enforcement of that rule and the monitoring about which we are all so anxious arises out of clause 4(5). If a business is being operated, someone could be prosecuted under clause 4(5) for operating without the necessary road service licence for a stage carriage. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, we have in the Bill doubled the penalty for that offence in order to retain a proper deterrent to the exploitation of these arrangements by illegal taxi operators.<br><br>
The question is, what evidence will be required to show that someone is in fact carrying out a business? That should be left to the facts of each case. We shall then be able to determine whether the fares collected exceed the running costs of the vehicle for that particular journey. Our aim is to be able to determine whether or not a business is being run. It is not necessary, in order to achieve that aim, to apply to the generality of car-sharing arrangements this extreme example of red
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0212">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 377</span>
tape to insist that a list of the running costs of the journey must be displayed before any informal agreement may be entered into.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has given the Bill an interpretation which I had not realised that it could bear, but I am very ready to be educated by him in this matter. He is suggesting to us that if someone were challenged for having made a profit while he was believed to be operating under the provisions of clause 2(3), he would have to accept that he was in fact operating a stage carriage and bear the penalty for having contravened stage carriage regulations. What ensures that that flows from clause 2(2)? There is a definition of "stage carriage" in clause 3. What would happen if someone being challenged for having made a profit said "But I am travelling under the provisions of clause 2(2)"? He could still defend himself, surely, on the grounds that he was within the provisions of schedules 1, 2 or 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be a taxi or hire car, as is stated here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. It does not have to be a taxi or a hired car. Subsection (2) says that the vehicle can carry passengers at separate fares in the course of a business in carrying passengers without being a public service vehicle. Then, of course, the carriage regulations are to stop the requirement of having a road service licence and not a public service vehicle licence provision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The arrangements that we have talked about so far, the private car arrangement which is a hire-car business, will blunder, if I have understood the examples given, into being eventually, when we reach that part of the Bill, stage carriage services, which will require a road services licence.<br><br>
No other possibility has opened up on the clause. Let me make one final attempt. We are here considering what is a public service vehicle. A public service vehicle, if it is for under eight passengers, is not a public service vehicle unless it is used for power and reward, used to carry passengers as separate fares, and used in the course of a business of carrying passengers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 378</span>
In subsection (3) we are trying to make a clear definition—not bothered with in the previous legislation—of what is not a business of carrying passengers. It is not a business of carrying passengers if the fares charged do not exceed the running costs. If the fares charged do exceed the running costs, it may be a business of carrying passengers.<br><br>
By this amendment the Opposition are trying to bring into the Bill the only clear situation where it is not a business, is one where fares do not exceed the costs, and, say the Opposition, where both costs are set out as a list of the cost for that journey in the vehicle in each case.<br><br>
I hope that answers the right hon. Gentleman's point. That is the context of the amendment and in that context, far from bringing clarity into the law, freeing us from red tape, the Opposition are trying to bring in an absurd arrangement whereby any informal car sharing will not be legal unless somebody sticks a list of the charges for the journey in the vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that what the Parliamentary Secretary has said deals with the context of the amendment. The difficulty facing Opposition Members arises from what was said on the previous amendment about the penalty that would follow from the breach of subsection (3). We were told that there would be an increase in penalty to £200, but did not know until the Parliamentary Secretary expounded on the amendment that the penalty to which he referred was the penalty in clause 4(5). He is saying that if somebody with a vehicle of not more than eight passengers makes a profit, he may be conducting a business. He may be conducting a business, but it would not follow from that, under the provisions of the clause, that he necessarily required a public service vehicle licence for the vehicle.<br><br>
Clause 2(2) spells out a condition in which a vehicle can carry passengers at separate fares without its being a public service vehicle, so the point I make about the penalty remains valid. What is the penalty which flows from making a profit where one should not make a profit in operating under clause 2(3)?
I think the Minister has accepted that he would not have to show that he was in breach of contract carriage requirements for that purpose, and I think he will accept that I have shown that he does not necessarily require to have a public service
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0213">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 379</span>
vehicle licence; therefore he could not necessarily be prosecuted for not having a public service vehicle licence. For what can he be prosecuted, and what is the appropriate penalty?</span></p>
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This clause determines what the vehicle is. Is the vehicle a public service vehicle? If it is a public service vehicle the first thing required is an operators' licence. Somewhere in the Bill, which I confess I cannot immediately find, there is a penalty for operating the vehicle without an operators' licence. It also depends the kind of carriage comprised by what he is doing and in certain circumstances other offences could grow. If what he is carrying out is an unlicensed stage carriage service the operator will be guilty of the offence to which we referred.<br><br>
When we reach the appropriate stage in the Bill hon. Gentlemen will find that the penalties for almost all these offences, subject to correction if I have made a slip, have been increased. We are increasing the penalties in line with inflation because it is not our intention to relax the penalties on these various illegal practices.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Porter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not also be the case in these circumstances that a civil action could lie by a disaffected passenger who had overpaid the fares for more than one journey? Would he not have a right of action in the county court for the return of money that had been paid over and above; so an action would lie with the individual as well as through the police and the magistrates' courts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that a civil claim would lie depending on the terms of the agreement between the driver and the passenger. If the agreed fare had been entered into because of some misrepresentation by the driver about the running costs of his vehicle, I accept that the passenger could recover the excess charge. At the moment I do not wish to be drawn into the civil legal ramifications of what we are doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we can clear this up in about 30 seconds flat. If the Under-Secretary could show me the offence and the penalty that a man commits who is making a profit but does not become a PSV operator, this is the nub of the matter. If he becomes a PSV operator
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 380</span>
legislation is there that will take care of it. Our problem is that if a man is making a profit on car sharing—in the Minister's own words—he may be a PSV business.<br><br>
We are asking the Minister to show us the offence and the penalty if the man is purely making a profit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no offence of any kind under the Bill or under any previous legislation, as far as I am aware, which arises from making a profit out of a journey. The offence arises if one is illegally operating a public service vehicle. I shall not engage in this perplexed debate any further than this. We have amendments on which we can clarify matters further.<br><br>
In the light of the interesting discussion we have had in the last five minutes I should clarify exactly what I mean when I say that it may be a business of carrying passengers if a profit is made. The clause is concerned with making clear what is not a business, therefore if the fares do not exceed the cost that is no concern of the Bill.<br><br>
If the fares charged for a journey exceed the cost, it may be in the course of a business, it may be a PSV. Why do I say "may"? Let me give an example which I shall try not to make too frivolous, but I shall make it a fairly extreme one to illustrate the point. I might make a profit on one journey. This evening, as an ordinary motorist, I might arrange with someone to give him a lift to a particular destination for vastly more than it will cost me. I might encounter somebody who desperately wanted to get to Heathrow and I might, very unfairly and an improper thing to do, say "I will take you there for £50". He might be so desperate to catch his plane that he would pay me the £50 and I would race out there to help him out. I would undoubtedly make a profit on the journey, but it would be one off. Because I made a profit on the journey it might be argued that I was carrying on a business of carrying passengers, but I could successfully mount a defence to that. For that one evening I could say that I had never done it before and would never do it again. I did not normally carry passengers and it was an entirely one off thing. It would be a matter of fact in each case.<br><br>
If I am advertising in the local newsagents that I will do this on request and I am doing it regularly, or if it turns out that I have been seen at Heathrow doing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0214">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 381</span>
exactly the same thing the week before, the presumption grows that I am carrying on a business of carrying passengers. I hope I have illustrated the point that a profit on a particular journey does not in itself demonstrate that one is carrying on a business.<br><br>
The complexities which have, rather engagingly, been conjured out of this by the Opposition do not arise because we are dealing here with the idea that it is necessary to demonstrate that it is not a business, to make it clear without doubt that car sharing is not affected by this because car sharing does not make the vehicle a public service vehicle. We must have the clearest possible definition of the fares not exceeding the running costs of the vehicles. I do not want to take those points any further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The interpretation of the law is complex. But we were faced with a difficulty because the Minister himself made clear, when we pressed him, that the penalties could occur if somebody made a profit, so determined by the magistrates' courts, and the fines were being increased from £100 to £200. That is entirely different from the point made by the Parliamentary Secretary, unless he was suggesting that it may be interpreted that, if a person were shown to be making a profit, he should be considered for a public service licence. There is a difference between these two issues, and I do not think we can ask for clarification now. I hope that at a later stage the Parliamentary Secretary will give us an undertaking.<br><br>
As I understand it—this is one of the reasons for the amendment—there is no penalty for making a profit or business in car sharing. If that is so, it is more of an argument for having a list of charges in the car.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is confusing himself. I have listened to my right hon. Friend and I think the hon. Gentleman will find, on re-examination, that at no stage did it occur to me that my right hon. Friend was saying anything different from what I am saying now and vice versa. He was talking about the penalties for carrying on a business. The hon. Gentleman confused himself. He said there were no penalties for making a profit or business. There are no penalties for making a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 382</span>
profit on a journey. If one carries out a business, that is a public service vehicle and there are penalties. It is the question of what is a business with which we are concerned, and hon. Members are getting obsessed and misleading themselves on this business of the profits on an individual journey.<br><br>
That is why the Opposition are proposing unworkable amendments designed to cover the profit or loss on every individual journey that a vehicle might make. Hence the determination that whenever any share arrangements of any kind are entered into, notice shall be displayed.<br><br>
I hope I have adequately answered those points. It seems to me that upon reflection the hon. Member may feel that this debate has served usefully to clarify the situation. It is clear that the hon. Gentleman's amendment would extend to practices which he cannot conceivably want to make unlawful and give rise to endorsement offences on a licence. He might want to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If ever I gave the Parliamentary Secretary a lift home from the House, I would never dream of taking any money from him towards the journey. It would be a different matter if we were to share a taxi, however. I also doubt very much whether he would offer me a lift, but I may be doing him a gross injustice, and if he offered me a lift on a car-sharing basis, I am convinced that he would end by making a profit out of it. I should not like to see him getting into trouble over that so I should have to decline his kind offer.<br><br>
I do not accept the Parliamentary Secretary's opinion that this is a ridiculous amendment, and I think my hon. Friends have demonstrated that it is not. There is no protection in the Bill for the individual who may be liable to exploitation. We believe that there should be. We have heard the Parliamentary Secretary, but we do not accept his arguments. Therefore, we wish the amendment to be put to the vote.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 42, in page 3, line 17, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) the journey is one which, even if no passengers paying a contribution towards the running costs under this subsection were carried, would have been made by the driver between the starting and finishing points or, in either case, the vicinity thereof at about the same time of day".</p></blockquote>
We understood the words of the Parliamentary Secretary when he said that the general aim was to have an infinite variety of flexible arrangements open to those engaged in car sharing, but he was obliged to make clear, even on the last amendment, that the Bill does not provide for an infinite variety of arrangements. In fact he pointed out fairly and clearly to the Committee that one of the ways in which the Bill precludes that variety is by requiring the arrangement to be made before the driver starts out. In other words, if Joe takes his car out one morning to drive to work, sees Bill at the bus stop, and stops and asks him whether he would like a lift, he cannot charge Bill anything towards his running costs under the provisions of clause 2, because the arrangements were not made before the driver started on his journey.<br><br>
Amendment No. 42 fully accepts that limitation and seeks to build upon it a condition that we think, given that first provision in the clause, is completely fair. It will avert the considerable worries of those who think that, under the guise of the clause, some people will operate businesses and seek to defend themselves —quite illegally, we admit—by saying that they are engaged in car sharing. The amendment seeks to limit car sharing to journeys which the driver would make whether or not he had paying passengers. It would meet entirely the legitimate range of car sharing in which we want people to engage. We have nothing against legitimate car sharing which does not undermine legitimate businesses. The Minister, in replying to a previous amendment, made a superb defence of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 384</span>
Labour Government's 1978 Act of 1978 in so far as it made provisions for car sharing. We are less adulatory about our own legislation. Sometimes we can see that it is not perfect and that its results cannot always be predicted. But we encouraged car sharing when in Government, and we do so in Opposition where we think that it can make sense and will help people. We encourage it where the law can make clear how car sharing can be engaged in without raising difficulties and justifying the fears of many who fear this legislation.<br><br>
6.45 p.m.<br><br>
Amendment No. 42 would certainly cover both work and leisure journeys. There is no doubt about that. If a person intended to go out on a day's fishing, to use the Parliamentary Secretary's example, he could take someone with him and get a contribution towards the cost. It would cover journeys to work normally made and it could be easily checked. I think that it would cover a number of social-cum-business journeys, providing that they were journeys which the driver would normally make.<br><br>
The amendment's advantage is that it would go some way towards cutting out touting operations and fly-by-night operators. It would certainly be hard for somebody who was making the trip to London airport with his car and touting for business there to claim that the journey was one that he would make in any case, if he never purchased an air ticket.<br><br>
The amendment would give a measure of perfection and make the provision slightly more enforceable. It would probably begin to make enforceable provisions which are otherwise unenforceable, and it would not be unduly restrictive. As the wording makes clear, the amendment would permit those small deviations which people normally make in car-sharing arrangements to accommodate those with whom they are sharing their car. It would enable somebody, instead of going directly home, to make a deviation on his journey to drop somebody to whom he had offered the car-sharing arrangement, or to go a little past and then come back,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0216">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 385</span>
because the words of the amendment are clear—he must start or finish in the vicinity of the place to which he would be travelling in any case, whether or not he was carrying a passenger.<br><br>
I do not need to dwell on the amendment at any length. I hope that the Minister will accept it as a constructive contribution towards meeting the aims of the Bill which will go some way towards reassuring those who claim, with justification, in my opinion, that the Bill as now drafted is virtually unenforceable. It will also go some way towards assuring people that those journeys which they normally make are the ones which we should like to see them use for the car-sharing purposes of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that the amendment is put forward in a constructive way and is an attempt, again, to get clarity for what has been, in part, an agreed aim—to cut out the illegal hire operator. But it is another amendment which is so wide in its effect that it goes far wide of its target and would have a destructive effect on some desirable car-sharing arrangements.<br><br>
Just as the previous amendment did, amendment No. 42 applies to all car sharing. The effect would be to take away the protection of this subsection from all car sharing, except where the driver was intending in any event to make the journey more or less to the same place and more or less at the same time of day. In effect, it would cut out of the protection of this subsection any driver who was car-sharing to do somebody else a favour. The first category of cases, therefore, that would be adversely affected by such an amendment would be anyone who agreed to run a friend or neighbour to a particular point in exchange for a reasonable, nonprofit-making contribution towards the cost. That would immediately be caught by the amendment.<br><br>
Even more seriously, organised voluntary car schemes would be affected. We have not debated them enough, but they are important, and I repeat again the example of the social car schemes. I have cited the WRVS, but I do not think that its members are the only people who run what are called social car schemes for the benefit of the elderly, the disabled and others and of the isolated generally in rural communities. They are drivers who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 386</span>
do not pay but who share out the costs among the passengers, but they run journeys all over the place. They are journeys which the drivers would certainly not be making between the same starting and finishing points at that time except to provide a form of transport for those who have entered into a car-sharing arrangement. A provision of this kind would catch all the genuine volunteers.<br><br>
I do not think that I need elaborate further. I would accept the amendment if it were solely confined to the circumstances which were plainly in the mind of the right hon. Gentleman when he proposed it, but on consideration it is clear that it would apply far more widely. I do not think that it would be his intention to take away the protection of the subsection from every driver who happened to be doing a favour to somebody else in entering into a car-sharing arrangement for a certain journey.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I was saying on the previous amendment applies here. Possibly for quite laudable reasons the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to put in clause 2 a whole spectrum of arrangements which can be known by the generic term of "car sharing". The problem is that he is failing in that objective.<br><br>
What would be better would be to accept my right hon. Friend's amendment which, as he said, is aimed at the category of car sharing or vehicle occupying on the work-place to home type ofjourney. It is a perfectly valid amendment which would add to the clarity of the law.<br><br>
If the Minister wants to protect other types of journey for socially useful purposes by charitable organisations and other non-profit-making organisations, the best way to do so is by making specific provisions to cover them. I am sure that all Opposition Members—although we have not consulted about it—would be happy to accept some late amendments which would achieve just that, while at the same time taking on board my hon. Friend's proposition that amendment No. 42 would clarify the position and go a long way towards satisfying our doubts about the proposition, even allowing for the extension of advertising and so on that would go with it.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that the Parliamentary Secretary will seriously consider accepting the amendment and covering the problem, which we acknowledge it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0217">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 387</span>
would introduce into the Bill by making specific provision for charitable organisations which move people about on journeys other than those from home to place of work and back again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust that my hon. Friend will not be tempted to accept the amendment, even though I welcome the spirit in which it was moved by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). I welcome it because he specifically said that the Labour Party was not opposed to car sharing. By contrast, one of his hon. Friends earlier said, quite categorically, as the record will show, that he was against car sharing <i>per se.</i><br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman went out of his way—his amendment does the same—to welcome certain forms of car sharing. What he is saying basically is that if a number of people are making the same journey, one person per car, that is one of the nonsenses which we cannot afford as a society and therefore it must be desirable if the same people get together, make that same journey to the same place of work and come into the city or whatever they are doing. That form of car sharing he welcomes. Fair enough. But I think that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that, by restricting his amendment, car sharing will stand little chance of succeeding, because the amendment would be so restrictive.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman goes back to the 1978 Act, which he says he is not so enthusiastic about. How often we hear that from parties that move from Government into Opposition. That refers not just to the Labour Party, for I frequently recall hearing the phrase in the past few years. How quickly people become disenchanted with their own legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The European Communities Act 1972.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of us were never enamoured of that. Disenchantment is spreading very rapidly indeed.<br><br>
Even the car-sharing provisions of the 1978 Act went beyond what the hon. Gentleman is seeking to restrict them to in this amendment. It was possible to advertise. The principle of advertising, even in a restricted sense, was to seek to encourage new car-sharing arrangements and to encourage people to make a journey together that would not otherwise be made.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 388</span>
For example, if a number of people commute from a village and the bus service is inadequate, four people might club together to pay for a car, share expenses and travel to London jointly. That journey might not be made at all without the car-sharing arrangements proposed by the Bill. But it would be prohibited if we accepted the amendment.<br><br>
Moreover, as my hon. Friend pointed out, the amendment would exclude many of those other socially desirable car-sharing facilities that make a real contribution to rural life. Surely we are trying to encourage the use of one car by a larger number of people on journeys that would not otherwise be made. If we restrict car sharing to journeys that would be made anyway, we are not contributing much to the wellbeing of society. The Bill as it stands will make some contribution to society. I do not claim that it will be dramatic, but it will be a contribution.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman's amendment is well-intentioned but is so restrictive as to destroy the objectives which even he seeks to achieve. While it has been useful to debate the amendment, I hope he will not press it to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being out of the room when the Minister replied. The points made since I returned to the room are that what the amendment seeks to once again to differentiate between those actvities carried out in a social way and those which can be considered a regular part of plying for hire, carrying passengers and profiting from that activity.<br><br>
It is true that the Transport Act 1978 made clear that the intention was that such journeys should be those made between A and B in a regular pattern. Admittedly, in the trial areas we were attempting to consider not only car-sharing arrangements but also community buses. We began to exempt from public service vehicle regulations the age limitation on the driving of vehicle, and allowed a number of arrangements, including the use of hire cars. Indeed, I had the opportunity of talking with the people involved in the trial areas of North Yorkshire, where some of these examples were tried and as I said earlier, reports were given to the Minister on the success of such schemes.<br><br>
The Minister said he has a great deal of sympathy with the points made in the amendment. But one must consider the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0218">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 389</span>
wide area over which he envisages car sharing to be considered, which he said would go much further than the kind of WRVS and other social car sharing arrangements. Presumably he has in mind that somebody may agree to go from A to B, even if he was not intending to go on that journey, but was providing a kind of public service, as they have been doing in the trial areas in encouraging people who have cars to make that car available for a specific journey even if it was not necessarily the desired intention of the driver to go from A to B on that day.<br><br>
We embodied that principle in the 1978 Act, although we conditioned it by the authorities of control I mentioned earlier, and confined it to specific trial areas in order to see just how flexible one can be with such arrangements.<br><br>
What my right hon. Friend is as much concerned about in this amendment is to make clear, and attempt once again to distinguish, the line on what is to be considered an area of legitimate activity and not profit-making, however that may be defined. But it was the Parliamentary Secretary who made the point, in his famous example of going to Heathrow for £50 on one journey and showing that that had not been done before, that, therefore, as a precedent had not been created, one could not readily argue that it was regular transport between A and B, which would be a necessary condition of conducting a form of business.<br><br>
One journey may not be a business, but 10 on the same day may form a regularity that may contribute to the consideration that a business is actually being conducted. If that is an influencing factor, somebody may find that what may well be a proper charge for one journey, when multiplied by 10 gives a considerable profit—bearing in mind that it is not simply a direct charge for petrol. If one did the journey 10 times and only charged for petrol there would be no gain. Indeed, taking the rundown of the vehicle, and depreciation, one could even be making a loss, as would be the case in car sharing where petrol is the only shared charge involved.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to make clear, as did the 1978 Act, that where there is car sharing, and where we allow advertising in a much more limited way than in the 1978 Act, we require that the journey should be one regularly conducted
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 390</span>
between A and B, or that the driver was going to a place of work and shared his car with others going to the same destination.<br><br>
Without the amendment, anyone wishing to advertise a journey between A and B would not be required to be going to that destination, asking others to join him and charging them separate fares, but would now be able to do that journey 10 or 20 times, or as many times as he wanted in the day. If that is multiplied against whatever are considered legitimate charges to be added to the cost of petrol it is a lucrative proposition.<br><br>
If the desire is to reduce those four cars coming at 9 a.m. and going back at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m., this amendment makes clear that car owners are to use their cars in a manner which is beneficial to all, namely, that one car instead of four can be used between A and B but we do not want them to make a profit. Adopting the amendment will at least make clear that the person would have to be embarked on a journey in order to operate the arrangement and not necessarily be regularly plying between A and B, which generally would be considered, even under the definition of costs in the Bill to be making a lucrative profit out of that business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary and the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) have made clear their objection to the amendment. They believe that it is an undue restriction on the car-sharing arrangements they want under the Bill. But they do so from different angles.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Faversham says that the amendment would take away an encouragement from those people to make journeys under the car sharing arrangements which they would not otherwise make. I accept that point entirely. It would take away that encouragement. But, depending on what one considers to be the proper aims of this part of the legislation, that can be a good or a bad thing.<br><br>
If one believes that it is desirable in modern transport legislation to deter people from using private cars to make journeys which they do not consider necessary to make on a regular basis, it is obviously a good thing. If the aim of the Bill is to save petrol, amendment No. 42 would be making some modest contribution towards that, in so far as it deters people from getting together and making a car

journey they would not otherwise make, but encourages them to share a car when they are undertaking a journey they would make in any case. The argument adduced by the hon. Member for Faversham can be resolved only according to what one considers the proper aims of car sharing. Until now, I did not understand that it was the Minister's view that the aim of the car-sharing provision was to encourage as many cars as possible to take to the roads and to encourage people to undertake journeys on a car-sharing basis that they would not otherwise undertake. But clearly that is the view of the hon. Member for Faversham.<br><br>
I concede at once that a social case can be argued for saying that people should travel more—that some people's lives are unduly limited because there are no transport facilities that they can afford or that would enable them to engage in the range of activities they should be able to engage in. That is particularly true of some rural areas, but it is not peculiar to them. Some people, because they cannot afford a taxi fare, are prevented from travelling to places where they would engage in perfectly valid activities which might add a dimension to their lives.<br><br>
There is a very fair argument for encouraging car journeys. But I think the answer to the problem lies not in the car-sharing arrangement but in improving public services and not undermining the commercial contributions to the transport service that cater for those needs. That is what we are in danger of doing if we pursue the line now being advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary and the hon. Member for Faversham.<br><br>
If the idea spreads abroad that the car-sharing provision is supposed to enable people to make arrangements to use private cars which will in some way offset the damage the Government are doing in other ways to public transport services, or offset the undermining of the position of the entrepreneurs who make their living by providing transport services on a small scale for people who will in the future be provided for by car sharing, the general cause of improving transport services in this country will not be well served. But that is not the point on which the Parliamentary Secretary rested his case. His objection is extremely interesting. He has used the same argument before. He has argued that any restriction of the car-sharing provisions in the Bill carries with it the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 392</span>
danger that the voluntary services might be prevented from operating vehicles under a car-sharing arrangement.<br><br>
This is not the first time that a Standing Committee of the House has addressed itself to that problem. The problem was considered when the 1978 Bill was in Committee. It was considered in connection with the community bus services. A specific provision was made to enable buses or carriages to be shared. It covered specifically those cases in which one would want the vehicle to be driven by a voluntary driver—a driver who was not earning his living by driving. That provision was very valuable. There is a case for building on that legislation and extending it if necessary.<br><br>
I think it would be a very grave error to follow the logic of the Parliamentary Secretary's argument by saying that any continuation of those arrangements must depend solely upon the provision we make for car sharing. The social need is for much wider provisions than have until now have been considered suitable for car sharing. There can be few of us who have not in our own constituencies seen the efforts by voluntary organisations to meet the specific transport needs of disadvantaged sections of the community.<br><br>
Our handicapped constituents are an excellent example. A number of voluntary organisations go to considerable lengths to provide handicapped people with the means of reading the provisions made for them. In doing so, they provide an invaluable service. In my own constituency, voluntary organisations have even made arrangements for a number of handicapped people to go to a swimming pool on a Sunday where they can be trained in a special way by people who can devise swimming strokes suitable for people with various handicaps. That would have been absolutely impossible without some very special transport provisions.<br><br>
I put it to the Committee that considerations such as that are very different from those that give rise to the fear that the car-sharing provisions will be used by people who want to make a profit out of services and thus undermine the genuine car-sharing arrangement. I think the car-sharing arrangement could be conducted perfectly well within the terms of amendment No. 42.<br><br>
The Minister ought to tell the Committee why he feels there should not be a development of the community bus ser-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0220">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 393</span>
vice provisions, or similar provisions, as envisaged under the 1978 Act, and why he feels it is necessary to widen car-sharing provisions to cover operations of the sort he is talking about. It is not those operations that give rise to the fear I have described and I would suggest that they do not need to be circumscribed in this way but can be covered quite adequately in legislation by provisions other than those of car sharing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not seem to have made much progress in debating this amendment, although the debate has been interesting. I have already used the example of the social car schemes. As I have already attempted to explain to the right hon. Gentleman, it is he who is bringing in new restrictions as compared with the provisions in the 1978 Act. He is attempting to bring in restrictions on car sharing which would go beyond the present Bill and have an adverse effect on schemes such as the one he has just described.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman heard my arguments when I spoke earlier. Amendment No. 42 would apply to the case where someone ran a couple of handicapped children to a swimming pool every Sunday in exchange for payment. I can hardly believe that it is the right hon. Gentleman's intention that such an arrangement should be taken out of the protection of clause 2(3) and made subject to the licensing control. But as I listen to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the Labour Benches, I sometimes feel that it is only the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall), who frankly admits that he is opposed to all car sharing, who is being frank with the Committee. The amendments moved by the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends all tend in one direction.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) suggested if I may summarise his argument, that we should confine these restrictions to charitable bodies, or perhaps only to those advertising. But the most complex amendments would be necessary to restrict what we have here to such a very narrow scope.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) said, we must remind ourselves that the purpose of the Bill is to encourage legitimate car sharing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 394</span>
and to extend it. Until we started the debate we believed that that was the aim of both sides of the Committee. There is no conflict between what my hon. Friend said and what I have said in the past about the purposes of car sharing. In some circumstances, it is energy saving. People may regularly use one car for a journey rather than four separate cars. In other circumstances, car sharing serves a social need, enabling people who would otherwise not be able to do so—people who may be handicapped, disabled or elderly—to travel. As my hon. Friend said, in many villages it is a public service for someone to run other people living in the village, who do not have cars, to particular destinations in exchange for the cost of the journey. Such arrangements are not confined to rural areas. There is no reason why, in an urban area, someone should not offer an elderly neighbour a lift to visit a relative who lives in another part of the city which cannot conveniently be reached by bus. Travelling by bus between neighbouring suburbs can involve going all the way into town, changing buses and going all the way back out again. A neighbour offering a lift can facilitate the journey.<br><br>
It is no answer—it is no support for these restrictive amendments—to say that passenger services must be improved. We are all in favour of improving public passenger transport but there is a limit to the extent to which public passenger transport can cover every conceivable eventuality for every section of the community, the old, the disabled, and so on. That explains adequately why that the amendment will have a far more restrictive effect than that which first attracted Labour Members to it. I invite the Committee to reject it.</span></p>
<p>7.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty that the Minister is raising is one which he must concede arises out of his own legislation. There is nothing in the 1978 Act to prevent any of those desirable types of car sharing which he has just described. In fact, the 1978 Act went a considerable way down that path.<br><br>
In proposing this legislation, which moves into a lot of other areas, the Minister and his right hon. and hon. Friends have registered the fears that give rise to this amendment. It seems to me that there are two ways in which we might deal with this. One is that we could withdraw the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0221">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 395</span>
amendment and table a further amendment on Report. The other way is to carry the amendment, and table on Report an amendment which would deal with the desirable types of car sharing that would otherwise be caught by the amendment. Surely that cannot be the case, and I hope that the Minister will readily concede that the problem does not arise because of the attitude of the Opposition. Far from it. The attitude of the Opposition was not to limit people to a desirable car-sharing arrangement, but to try to meet the legitimate fears that proper development of public services was being undermined. It was felt that the Bill would be an alibi for considerable cuts in development of valuable transport services.<br><br>
I hope the Minister will agree that we might be somewhat more flexible in our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 396</span>
approach and see if we can, by Report, find a way of defining what we want to take place under car sharing that does not go as wide as his Bill does, but is not so narrow as the amendment.</span></p>
