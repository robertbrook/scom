Quite apart from the reflection upon your chairmanship implied in the remarks, Mr. Dean, if he reconsiders his words and examines what I have said he will realise that what I have done up to now is to speak strictly to four out of the five amendments that we are considering; that is, apart from my reaction to the Minister's intervention and contention that our—amendments are not relevant because he has decided to abandon his own clause.

	<p>ment No. 219 on the deletion of the category specified in subsection 1(	<i>b</i>), the vehicles which may or may not have their disc which can be identified as belonging to the particular vehicles.</p>
	<p>On amendment No. 220 I have asked who could exercise the discretion implied in the term "may include" on clause 23, page 22, line 19. On amendment No. 215 I have talked about the nature of the penalty and its relationship to enforcement, and how much more difficult that would be with withdrawing the discs.</p>
	<p>I have kept myself strictly to the confines of the four amendments which leaves me only to deal with the question raised by amendment No. 206 of having the registration number included. I merely say on that that this is obviously the simplest of ways of dealing with the relationship between the disc and the vehicle. I realise that that raises much wider issues, and in particular it raises the difficult issue of the transferable disc, but that, I take it, is a matter for another amendment.</p>
	<p>Therefore I look forward to hearing the views of my hon. Friends on the amendments that we are now discussing, and to what I hope will be a constructive response from the Minister. His having abandoned the ship does not mean that the ship cannot be sailed, or improved. Therefore I think that we need to discuss how valid a vessel it would be if these improvements were not carried.</p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 212, in page 22, line 26, after "21(1)", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"providing they are satisfied that the person to whom the licence is granted has at the time the maximum number of vehicles which he may use under the licence and that those vehicles can be operated from his operating centre in the 'Commissioners region'.".</p></blockquote>
The need for this amendment to be included in the Bill is simple and evident. There has to be some means of preventing an operator from getting more operator's discs than he has vehicles. If there is no such check, what is to prevent an operator from allowing—for a variety of reasons, some of which may stem from friendship or from a desire for financial gain—another operator to provide vehicles which would operate under the cover of his discs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An operator who has had his operator's licence revoked could, perhaps, continue to operate his vehicles under cover of the discs of the operator who had more discs than vehicles. It would also be possible for an operator who had an excess of operator's discs to enter into unofficial arrangements for financial gain with small opera-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1248</span>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>tors who operated only one or a few vehicles to allow them to operate under his umbrella.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>We are all aware of cowboy operations in the construction industry. Unless adequate safeguards are built into the working of the Bill, I foresee a considerable expansion in the number of cowboy operations in the transport industry. The possible abuse and misuse of the operator's disc could become widespread, particularly, as the Minister has stated, if the clause is eventually removed from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>I accept that the amendment would not prevent the person who deliberately sets out to get round the law from doing so, but it would make it that much more difficult. For that reason alone, it is worthy of support. I hope that, if it is not accepted by the Government, the traffic commissioners for any area will do the job for them. They should take the necessary precautions and investigate how many vehicles any operator owns and operates before granting the appropriate number of operator's discs.</p>
	<p>I hope also that the traffic commissioners will not just accept the information provided by applicants for public service vehicle operator's licences, but that they will take all reasonable precautions to ensure that each application is honest and genuine. I am surprised that a form of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0682">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1249</span>
words with the same intention as our amendment was not incorporated into the clause when the Bill was drafted.</p>
	<p>If an operator should acquire additional vehicles and so require extra discs, it is simple for him to obtain them. It is not every day that one purchases one or more public service vehicles. That is a matter that will be carefully considered for some time by the operator, due to the investment required even for the purchase of secondhand vehicles. Again, the traffic commissioners should find out whether the operator has in fact the number of additional vehicles for which operator's discs have been sought.
<br><br><!-- lb --></p>
	<p>The amendment also states that such vehicles can be operated from the operating centre in the commissioner's region. It will therefore be necessary for the traffic commissioners to ensure that any public service vehicle operator's operating centre is suitable for the number of operator's discs allocated. It is just not good enough to allow operators to conduct a public service vehicle business from the front room of a house, as many small or one-vehicles operators do. The amendment is a necessary precaution in the best interests of public safety and is, therefore, worthy of support.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend pointed out, the amendment arises from two basic considerations. First, as the Bill is now constructed there is no guidance whatever to the commissioner to guard against a situation in which the operator applies for more discs than he can currently use. As we have lost certain of our amendments I have to work within the wording of the clause as it now stands. I therefore take it, Mr. Dean, that to be in order I have to assume that discs may or may not relate to particular vehicles, and the emphasis of the clause could be such that it is more likely that they would not be so related.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there must be a considerable danger that an operator who sees some advantage in so doing will apply for many more discs than he has vehicles. He may have 30 vehicles and apply for 50 discs, or 10 vehicles and apply for 20 discs. In the circumstances envisaged by part of the clause, the commissioner may not know to which vehicles the disc will be attached. In issuing the operator's licence, the commissioner may quite properly carry out his
	<span class='label label-info column'>1250</span>
duties and examine the premises from which the operator will operate. He may even take an opinion on the condition of the vehicles, possibly from Ministry of Transport certifying officers or examiners, and form a view as to the competence of the operator based on the repair and maintenance facilities that he sees are available for such vehicles as the operator can show at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioner will not, however, be able to tell whether the facilities and organisation that the operator has at that time will be adequate or even appropriate to deal with such additional vehicles as he may acquire up to the maximum number of discs that he may obtain under the clause. Indeed, if the operator is unscrupulous, the vehicles that he acquires—after obtaining the discs—to bring him up to the maximum, may be vehicles such that, had they been seen at the time of the inspection, might have led the commissioner to form a very different view as to the adequacy of the operator's facilities to handle that type of vehicle. He may acquire older vehicles which require much more maintenance, or even vehicles of a different type which require different maintenance and repair facilities. There is, therefore, a serious point even just on the question of numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue in the amendment is a very special safeguard, requiring the commissioner to ensure that the number of vehicles for which the operator claims discs can be operated from the operator's own depot. I see nothing in the clause as at present constructed to prevent discs being slung about to vehicles being operated in any part of the country. An operator with a depot in Yorkshire, for instance, might provide discs for operations in his own name in any other part of the country. That is quite contrary to the intention of having control of the issue of the operator's licence based in the region in which the operator has his depot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, whilst I would not go so far as to claim that the amendment would prevent discs from being moved around and operations carried out with them in other parts of the country, it certainly has value in that it would reduce the risk of that happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because our amendments have not been carried the clause as it now stands allows discs to be transferred from vehicle to vehicle. I fail to see how any inspector will be able to check or detect the number of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0683">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
vehicles being operated with them. Given that discs can be swung from vehicle to vehicle, at the outside limit vehicles could be operated in shifts. One could have discs that covered a limited number of vehicles and move them from one vehicle to another. I dare say that most operators would not even begin to consider operating in that way. The aims of the Bill include ensuring that all vehicles that are operated are safe, properly managed and so on. But as my hon. Friend pointed out earlier today, we often legislate to deal not with the majority but with the minority. We shall take a lot of convincing by the Minister that the clause will not allow a minority of unscrupulous operators to evade, if not the broadest interpretation, certainly the strict aims of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had not previously been convinced of what I said about the need to take the clause out of the Bill, everything that has been said so far would have convinced me that I was right. The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) put his finger right on it at the end of his speech when he said that he was seeking to legislate for the minority. In doing that he is seeking to place restrictions on the vast majority. At the same time, he is seeking to add to the costs of public transport and to the burden on bodies such as London Transport and the National Bus Company. Even—dare I say it—the South Yorkshire PTE could be placed under new obligations by the system that he is devising. The questions that he has raised as to numbers of discs and numbers of vehicles reveal the complexity of the system and go to the heart of the argument. The system that we have already chosen is simpler. Everything that the right hon. Gentleman has said simply confirms my belief that the system proposed under clause 23 is unnecessary for the public and for the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the right hon. Gentleman intends to deal with the point of the amendment at some time. Will he give us the original justification, which he has presumably now abandoned, for putting the Bill before us in that form? Is he saying that it would add appreciably to costs to prevent operators from having a number of discs considerably in excess of the number of their vehicles? That seems the only inference to be drawn from his words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
Or is there some hidden cost involved, that he has not revealed? Surely there can be no effective licensing of the size of fleets if the number of discs is not controlled other than by the specification of a maximum that does not relate to the number of vehicles operated. There must have been some justification; there must—I hope—be some logical explanation for the way that the clause is framed. Or does the Minister deny that the clause permits excess discs to be issued? If there is some good reason for that we should like to know what it is. We shall have to debate the clause in its present form if, on the advice, the amendment is defeated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put one or two points to the Minister? My right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) has been put in some difficulty because of the procedural situation caused by the Minister's announcement that, in effect, he will withdraw the clause. My right hon. Friend referred to the familiarity of the public, the police and everyone else with the concept of the disc for public transport vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Minister should address himself—when he has finished talking to the Whip—to replying to that point. There is some substance in my right hon. Friend's contention that the regulating authorities, the operators and the police are familiar with the concept of the disc. Without wishing to stray on to a later clause, it seems to me that this is also related to the removal, under the provisions of clause 29, of the conductor's badge. That, too, is familiar and intended to give the public confidence, and those in public transport have learnt to rely on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister may be happy to plaster this information on the side of a double-decker bus so that it can be seen as it hurtles along, he should address himself to my right hon. Friend's question about whether he considers there will be disadvantages for the public and police if the basic, familiar concept of the disc is removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying back to an earlier amendment when we discussed the merits or demerits of discs. This amendment is on a much narrower point relating to the maximum number of vehicles, so it would not be in order for the Minister to deal with that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still recovering from the shock that the Minister gave us when he told us that, on reflection, he had taken out another clause. As I understand it now, it means that there will be a limit on the maximum number of vehicles on an operator's licence. Is that so? I presume that it is, because the amendment addresses itself to the relevance of the number of vehicles by limiting it to the number of vehicles an operator can handle. I believe</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>that that is the thinking behind the amendment. If the commissioner decides that an operator is licensed for X number of vehicles of different categories, that is in no way affected by the Minister's statement. Will the Minister give an indication whether he is thinking of taking away that implication? And will he confirm that there will still be control over the number of vehicles that an operator may run?</p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that with this we shall be taking new clause 13, and my hon. Friend wishes to move that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not be moved. We are now on clause stand part, with which it will be in order to discuss, but not to move, new clause 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee, as I did earlier, that we have had a very wide debate on the first amendment to the clause, on its merits or demerits, and on the question of discs. I thought that that would be for the convenience of the Committee, in view of the Minister's statement. I should not regard it as appropriate to go over that ground again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I shall fall foul of your ruling, Mr. Dean, save by accident, because it is not my intention to refer to clause 23. It might by now be clause 23 that was, in the old parlance. After our discussion I hope to move a new clause to pro vide:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A vehicle shall not be used on a road as a stage, express or contract carriage unless there is fixed and exhibited in the vehicle in the prescribed manner a notice giving the name, address and a brief summary of the powers of the traffic commissioners who issued the PSV operator's licence and road service operations licence for the vehicle in question."</p></blockquote>
As hon. Members will have observed, that is not related to clause 23, except that it concerns the display of some form of notice in or on a vehicle. That is why it has been included at this point in the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and I are concerned that if the travelling public have any cause for dissatisfaction with the service provided by a bus operator they should know where there is access to the authority that Parliament has established as being responsible for providing proper services in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As that was an element of consumer protection, I had hoped to convert the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to my view by gleaning some reference to consumer protection from the Conservative Party manifesto for the May 1979 election. Everyone regards his party manifesto as holy writ from which no one must stray. To my surprise I discovered that not one word of the Tory manifesto referred to consumer protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
In the circumstances I cannot find any form of holy writ that may appeal to the Minister of Transport. I shall have to rely on my own abilities of logic and rhetoric to persuade him. To digress momentarily, when Cranmer, Latymer and Ridley were imprisoned and faced with Jesuitical interrogation it was said that Master Cranmer leaned upon Master Latymer, Master Latymer upon Master Ridley and Master Ridley was left to lean on the singularity of his own wit. I do not claim to compare with that gentleman, but I shall do my best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried, during the dinner break, to discover organisations that are obliged to display notices indicating who is responsible and to whom one can complain. Although there are no statutory requirements, so far as I know, British Rail stations, certain London Transport vehicles, gas and electricity showrooms and other places providing a public service display notices indicating to whom one may complain if one is dissatisfied with the service or lack of it. And it seems wholly appropriate to assist the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those notices are all voluntarily displayed by the bodies concerned, although they may be displayed as the result of pressure from consumer organisations. But my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central proposes a change in that we would like a statutory obligation imposed on bus operators to provide such a notice. We justify the shift from a voluntary to a compulsory arrangement partly because we believe that if there were new legislation in the sphere of gas and electricity, and possibly even on British Rail, there seems a fair chance that some element of compulsion about the display of such notices would be introduced. I think that it would be a good thing, and generally in line with the attitude which is shifting towards consumer protection and giving the consumer the minimum information necessary if he is to assert his rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In public passenger transport, if the Bill, to our regret, goes through, we shall see great flux and change. I think that Opposition Members would argue that that flux and change will mainly be for the worst, although no doubt Government Members will argue that the flux and change will be an improvement. Nevertheless there will be a significant change in the bus services used by a number of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New companies will be coming in or so it is said—and old companies will be going out. There may be a lot of shifts and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0686">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1257</span>
changes of service in certain areas and there will be trial areas where there will be no control. In those circumstances, it is possible, even with major operators or with very small operators, that a member of the general public will not have much idea who is ultimately responsible for monitoring whether the service being provided is up to the standard that Parliament and the traffic commissioners have laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances it seems to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and myself wholly reasonable—indeed, an absolute requirement in this state of flux—that such notices should be provided in every vehicle that will be run in future, so that members of the public will know who is responsible for monitoring the standard of service in their area. That applies to the travelling public. Perhaps the non-travelling public are more important and it would be better if my hon. Friend and I had added that such a notice should be displayed on every bus stop and bus shelter. Generally speaking, people are more dissatisfied when they are standing waiting for a bus, even in the best of circumstances, than they are when they are travelling on one even in the worst of circumstances. Nevertheless, our amendment is confined at the moment to the moving vehicle and we cannot do any more about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will see some merit in what we are proposing. Again, in the spirit of trying to produce a decent piece of legislation, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and I should be happy if the Minister were to say "I cannot accept your exact wording, but I find the principle acceptable and I propose to do something about it". He may propose to do it by regulations, which would not be a satisfactory as putting it in the Bill. But we hope that he will take our proposal on board, so that—at the risk of a pun—these notices get on board and that this provision, which is intended to help the public, will commend itself to both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a small problem because, as I understand it, clause 23 is now to be withdrawn by the Minister. [	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "No."] That was what I understood. If the Minister wants to clarify it, he can do so now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to confine my remarks to new clause 13, which gets to the meat of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1258</span>
problem. We are now dealing with a change from the 1968 Act, which lays down the provision that the PSV licence is itself a disc and is fixed to the windscreen of the vehicle and as such specified the vehicle to which it relates as well as the holder. That is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If clause 23 is to be withdrawn—I have had no indication from the Minister that that is not the case, so I must assume that it is—we are now dealing with the public and the protection of the public at all times. The new clause would ensure that, if penalties were fixed, they could be invoked and any person—perhaps a policeman—could raise the issue. We ask that there be fixed and exhibited in the vehicle in the prescribed manner—that leaves the Minister a little leeway because he can lay down the prescribed manner—a notice giving the name and address and a brief summary of the powers of the traffic commissioner who issued the PSV licence. That is important, because in the Bill we are dealing with a release of previous restrictions, and there is now that freedom for the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone knows what British Rail is and how to contact it. Everyone knows what the Gas Board is and how to contact it. Everyone knows what the Electricity Board is and how to contact it. That information is published and that is desirable. If the public wishes to complain it is important that it knows how to do so. Why then do the Government not say that there should be exhibited in the vehicle the name and address and a brief summary of the powers of the traffic commissioners, so that if an individual wishes to make a complaint he has a note of the traffic commissioner's powers. If he does not have that, how does he know when, where and how to make the complaint?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it asking too much of the Government that they should provide for the placing in the vehicle of the relevant name and address. If I wanted to go to a court of law—we have heard during our debates the arguments of lawyers—against whom would I, as an individual, complain? If there is no disc and no name and address and I wish to complain, who do I complain about?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From an examination of the Government Benches it seems that, disappointingly, most of the lawyers have disappeared.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is great. If all the lawyers would stand up, we would know where we were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should have a brief adjournment while the Minister goes hastily out into the corridor, gathers up all the missing lawyers and consults them because a valid question has been asked—namely: against whom does the public complain? If clause 23 is not to stand part of the Bill—and I have not yet been refuted—discs will not appear. So how do we know?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us transfer ourselves outside the Committee. We become enclosed here, Mr. Dean, arguing the political points. But at the end of the day we shall be judged by the public when, unfortunately, the Bill becomes an Act. Then we shall have to implement it and we shall get down to where ordinary people stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us paint the picture. Here we have a vehicle, and in my usual quick way I dash to board it. The vehicle moves off and I say "I have a valid complaint because this man has replaced the operator's licence", but how do I establish that fact? If clause 23 is taken out by the Government and there is no disc, the new clause becomes more valid. It would be very interesting, having looked at some of the Government's notes defending the inclusion of clause 23, to know what has changed the Government's mind so that they want to take it out? There is a fundamental difference between present legislation and what the Government are proposing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the notes graciously supplied by the Government, they defend the inclusion of clause 23, yet at this late stage they want to take it out. Are we being told that everything that we read in the notes on clauses—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have come to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1260</span>
arguments on clause stand part. I understood the importance of providing notes on clauses for the convenience of the Opposition. It is not something that the Opposition can demand as of right. The hon. Gentleman could check with other Committees. Notes on clauses are not provided in many Committees. If the hon. Gentleman wants notes on clauses, I seek in as gentle way as I can to put it to him if he intends to thrust this back in the face of Government, he is not doing a service either to himself or the provision of notes on clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. There are two aspects to his remarks. One of my hon. Friends requested the same facility from the Minister as was afforded to the Minister when he was in opposition. The record shows that he asked for and received that facility. Can the Minister then argue that the notes should not be read?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. Your predecessor in the Chair, Mr. English, ruled exactly that. I do not make great play of this. I think that it is a matter for reasonableness on both sides. Certainly the hon. Gentleman, for whom I have great respect, will recollect that at no stage during the 1978 Bill did we seek to quote notes on clauses to Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of order, first, but it is also a matter for the hon. Gentleman. If he believes that notes on clauses are useful as background reading for himself, he is going a curious way about establishing it for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we can now return to clause 23 and new clause 13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to that very quickly. If notes are given, by whomsoever, whether it be the previous Government or this Government, surely one is entitled to read those notes and quote from them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. I should be grateful for your advice, but I thought the ruling on this point by your predecessor was quite fast.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1261</span>
he will not continue his arguments about the notes but return to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Dean. Perhaps I might remind the Committee that your predecessor in the Chair said on 29 January
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will try to explain to the Committee why I will not have notes on clauses brought into the discussion. I regard it as being of great assistance to Members of the House of Commons when notes of that type are produced. If they are produced and are used in the sort of way in which they have been used, the blunt truth is that they will not continue to be produced."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 29 January 1980; c.760.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chairmen are always united in their rulings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the point has been made. Whether it is accepted is another matter, but it is valid. I shall not go back to the notes, which are very useful. If the Minister reflects, he will recall that it was I who asked him to provide the notes. However, these notes are becoming embarrassing and I shall not mention them again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. It seems to me that we are still mentioning these notes on which you have given a steadfast ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a matter for the Chair to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would appear that I have been given good advice and never will I mention notes again. But I may recall from sources unknown, which miraculously appear in my mail and which in no way could be ascribed to the Government by any one of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been so well taken that the Minister himself intervened on his own arguments. One of his hon. Friends supported him. But from information unknown, received from goodness knows where, there is a case put by who knows and for what reason, that clause 23 should be part of the Bill. Far be it from me to try to establish where this mysterious information came from, but I do not want to belabour this point because I appreciate the Minister affording the Opposition the facility of notes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude—no doubt the Government will be pleased that I may conclude at this time—by saying briefly that if there was ever a case for new clause 13 it is by clause 23 being deleted from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My experience has not been great on Committees, as has probably been evident on more than one occasion. I do not know how many times it may have fallen to the Opposition to have to attempt to fight to keep a clause in a Bill that the Government originally brought to the Committee. We are attempting to strengthen the clause and we find that the whole clause is being taken out. I presume that the advice is that it will not be a matter of withdrawal because the Minister has, by the rules and procedure of the Committee, to put it to a vote and, presumably, will be voting against his own clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every one of us benefits from the advice that comes from many quarters and we do not want any bad feeling about it. There are occasions when it is tempting to draw an obvious point. But one does not need necessarily to refer to obvious areas of advice because it is clear in the Bill that it must have been in the Government's thinking to have included the clause. There has been a re-think, and the Minister made clear when he made his contribution that he had had reflections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that anyone wants to condemn any Minister who is open to reconsidering the argument. My complaint is that one can spend all the time arguing but still not have an opportunity to remove a clause. In this case the arguments produced by the Opposition may have no effect because other forces, namely, those who are experienced in the industry, have prevailed upon the Minister to say that the new clause is an extension of bureaucracy and that it does not improve the safety and standards of the industry, of which the discs are but one small part of a paraphernalia of controls that are embodied in these clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now almost need to argue the Minister's case of yesterday, or whenever it was he changed his mind. Our argument, therefore, is that the provision of these discs on a vehicle is the final logical part of a system of regulation that is being changed in the bus transport industry. It is being changed from the road licensing system which we understood and which was administered by the traffic commissioners on the basis of far different criteria from those being considered in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that this is a fundamental change from existing practice in the road transport haulage industry. We argue that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0689">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1263</span>
the new clause is important in order to maintain the standards set out in the clauses dealing with the PSV operator's licence, the classification of the different types of licences, the grants and the duration of the licnces and the conditions under which those licences will be granted. That is where there is common agreement, in principle, between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where we appear to be parting company is over whether it is possible, as a further means of enforcement, to say that the disc to be placed on the windscreen of the vehicle, wherever it may travel, should carry the sort of information which the Minister was originally convinced should be included on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's view is that it should be displayed as a means of enforcement, to help those who have the responsibility to take action where a vehicle is used in an unfit state, and so on, namely, the police authorities, the certifying officer and the various people responsible for the enforcement of the provisions contained in the Bill and other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know whether the Minister can accept the need for improved enforcement, to which we referred in relation to Professor Foster's report. In that report he argued that the operating licence system needed to be strengthened. Does the Minister envisage that the disc system should not apply to lorries? The same argument is involved. Perhaps the Minister will indicate why he has been persuaded to remove the disc system. The only reason given so far is that the traffic commissioners, with all their experience, have combined to advise the Minister that the system is not worth the bureaucracy involved. The Minister was clearly attracted to the idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon the Minister to say why an operating licensing system for coaches should not involve a disc system, when he presumably accepts— unless he gets converted again by the traffic commissioners—that it should apply to lorries. My understanding is that the traffic commissioners, who now give discs in the form that is stated in the clause and prescribe the manner of information on those discs, are the same commissioners who are responsible for issuing discs to the road haulage industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioners seem to believe that this should not apply to the passenger bus industry. I am concerned for the safety of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1264</span>
huge lorries or, indeed, any other form of transportation, but there tends to be an emphasis in the House of Commons, when dealing with public bus and transportation systems for carrying people around, on being sharper and firmer in our attitude towards disciplinary provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to spend any more time on clause stand part. It is interesting to note that if the Government were to reject clause 23 and my hon. Friend's new clause, the only remaining identification in the check system would be removed. I was powerfully impressed by the arguments in the Foster report that the agencies were asking not only that there should be discs on the vehicles but that the information contained on them should be more than presently required for lorries. Why should that be? They find that, with modern technology and computers, a policeman who may want to know who owns a vehicle, or who for any reason may need instant information, is able to have it. A licence provided the means by which, through the computer system, he could have the information within a few minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Minister will dwell a little more on the sort of thinking that convinced him. He has told us about the traffic commissioners. However, having received their advice, can he tell us why they still feel that it is important for the lorries, and what other agencies involved in the enforcements thought about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support new clause 13, tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) and for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans). I hope to impress on the Minister the importance of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate he will not simply tell us that the clause is defective in its draftsmanship. There have been several hard words about lawyers, and I shall not repeat those criticisms this evening. For reasons that would not be in order, I believe that neither the Minister nor I would wish to indulge in criticism of lawyers, particularly this evening. If the Minister feels that the legal draftsmanship is not adequate, perhaps he will take our points on board and attempt to do something else in the same direction. New clause 13 is a good attempt to deal with one small part of a very important problem, which is how to enable people to

participate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a widespread problem which Governments of both parties have recognised. It is necessary to involve people in the affairs which they feel concern them a great deal. There have been moves in that direction by Governments of both parties in a number of fields, for example, in the Health Service, and especially in planning. A major problem in enabling people to participate and to contact the appropriate authorities who are responsible for the matter in which they are interested, or for a service about which they wish to complain, or to make some other point, is to let them know where to go to make their representations. This is a small attempt to deal with that problem in respect of transport, and particularly buses. I feel strongly that it is a matter to which the Minister should give serious attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the difficulty is always getting the information to the people who need it and want to participate, and whom the Government want to see participating. In the case of planning applications that is relatively easy because one can display notices in the vicinity of the area with which the planning application has been lodged and the local planning authority can write directly to people who live near that place. With some other services that can be difficult, but here it is relatively easier to communicate the information to those most concerned and most likely to want to make representations. One has, in a sense, a captive audience for the information. It is very difficult for general advisory services, such as citizens advice bureaux, to make their services known to the people who need them. They often try to do so by distributing leaflets, which is an expensive and frequently wasteful way to communicate information. Even then, it does not necessarily get into the hands of people at the time when they want it. But to display a notice, such as is suggested in new clause 13, which would tell passengers who are the traffic commissioners and where they can be found seems an excellent way of informing people at a time when they are most likely to want to make representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to draw attention to a phrase in the clause which I think is of special importance. That is the reference to a brief summary of the powers of the traffic commissioners. It is not enough to display the names and addresses of the traffic commissioners. As Members of Parliament we
	<span class='label label-info column'>1266</span>
all encounter situations where people complain to the wrong authority. They wish to make a complaint about some aspect of public service and they are likely to direct their representations to the wrong place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.56 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we were interrupted by a Division in the Chamber, I was saying that the new clause tabled by my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) contained an important reference to the need for the notice to be displayed in each bus to include not only the name and address of the traffic commissioners, but:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a brief summary of the powers of the traffic commissioners".</p></blockquote>
Those requirements are important for two reasons. First, it is a problem common to all sorts of public authorities that they receive letters from members of the public about matters which are outside their jurisdiction. Apart from being very annoying, that practice is a source of unnecessary public expenditure because people have to be employed to deal with those letters, and all that they can do is to acknowledge the letter and say that it is not the business of that public authority. That is a wasteful use of public money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, when that happens, it is very annoying and dispiriting for members of the public. They receive letters from the public authorities which appear to be fobbing-off letters. However well worded the letter may be, the recipient believes that the public authority has done its best to make sure that the issue is not within its jurisdiction, having looked in the small print to find an excuse for not dealing with what is, to him, a justified and well-merited complaint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons it is important to include in the notice which is to be exhibited in a place where everyone in the vehicle can see it, not only the name and address of the place to which complaints should be sent, but the matters about which complaints can be received. I believe that this is an extremely important part of a new clause which I regard as in itself important. I

hope, therefore, that the Minister will give us a sympathetic reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following carefully the line of my hon. Friend's argument. The difficulty to which he alludes of the public contacting the wrong people with their complaints may arise in large measure because the public are not made aware that legislation ascribes powers to control, in quite detailed ways, the operation of services, and that large public authorities are responsible for trying to co-ordinate the planning of services. The public, therefore, may think that the opposite is the case and that their local authorities should be concerned about the detailed operations. Therefore, the Minister, having the powers suggested in the new clause of being able to select by regulation those points which he would emphasise in the notice, could, in his first set of regulations, make sure that that aspect of the commissioners' powers was particularly drawn to the public's attention in the notice to be put in the bus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful suggestion from my right hon. Friend and one that had not occurred to me. I find that, when complaints are directed to the wrong public authority, the public authority often sends a letter explaining that the matter is outside its jurisdiction, but does not take what I regard as the necessary step of forwarding the complaints to the proper authority. We have all seen that happen with Government Departments as well as with appointed bodies such as traffic commissioners. They take a different attitude when a Member of Parliament sends a complaint. Then they are often only too willing to forward a complaint to the appropriate quarter. But when it is from what they regard as an ordinary member of the public, they are less solicitous, careful, enthusiastic and anxious to pass the letter to the person who can do something about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that people will complain about their bus service to all sorts of authorities—often to their local and district councils which are not in fact running the bus—and therefore often complain to people who cannot do anything about it. It is important to let people know, not only where complaints should be sent, but also the subjects about which complaints can be entertained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1268</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), I wish to discuss new clause 13 as well as "clause 23 stand part". Like him also, I face the difficult decision as to whether it is better to have the clause in the Bill, albeit unamended, or to see it thrown out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our difficulty tonight, which is peculiar in our experience of proceedings on the Bill, is that the Minister has informed us that he will urge the Committee—urge his hon. Friends and presumably me and my hon. Friends—to vote to reject the clause. We understand the Minister's difficulty. We understand that it is part of our procedure that the "clause stand part" motion must be moved. But it makes it no easier for us to take that decision. I hope to demonstrate that I believe that there is a strong case for leaving the clause in the Bill. I shall observe carefully your ruling, Mr. Dean, that we cannot engage in the general arguments for or against the disc. But I believe that there is a strong case, not from the Government's point of view or even so much from the Opposition's point of view, but from the point of view of the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My opinion is reinforced by some indications sent to me by operators of the way in which they look at the provision for a licence disc. The starting point of the desire for a change of this kind on the operator's part is to be found in the psychology which lies behind having a disc that does not relate to the individual vehicle. We have not yet heard a case for approaching the clause in that way. We assume, as I believe we are entitled to do, that we shall not now hear a case from the Minister that is based on that psychology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has to be accepted that if we pass the clause as it is now, discs could be related to particular vehicles. On the basis of the clause, it cannot be held that there is not a considerable possibility of a batch of discs being issued which are unrelated to specific vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is important in the principle—which is new to our legislation—of the unrelated disc, is that it should be transferable within the operator's fleet. Therefore, in order to defend the clause from an operator's standpoint, I have to make the argument that the disc should generally be transferable within a fleet and only in peculiar and particular circumstances should it relate to a particular vehicle. That is not an easy case to make because it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0692">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1269</span>
moves away from changes that I should like to have seen in the other direction. But it must be considered if we are to do our job and examine the merits or otherwise of leaving the clause unamended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operator licensing system has been introduced as a streamlining of PSV licensing. With the public service vehicle system, the disc had to be related to a particular vehicle. I ask the Committee to consider how far that has posed difficulties for operators that could be removed if we passed the clause. I give a practical example. We should consider the case of operators who may operate the system open to them if the clause is passed. The clause could be helpful to an operator with, say, three licensed public service vehicles all of which are required for work on the following day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that it is 11.8 pm when the operator, who is possible a councillor and has been sitting in committees from about 10.30 am, with a short break for lunch, returns to his premises. Being a conscientious man and a good public service vehicle operator, he checks the availability of his vehicles for their next day's work. He then finds that during the evening, one of his vehicles has been struck by a car that has pulled out of a side road without stopping. In spite of the fact that he employs able and experienced drivers, an unforeseen event has occurred, and 33⅓per cent. of his fleet is out of action for the following day. As we know, the side panels of many public service vehicles are not particularly strong. They are sometimes made of thin gauge aluminium. Bang goes the car into the vehicle, which cannot be used the next day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present system, the operator would be able to hire another public service vehicle, but he would have to take the driver with it to cover the work to which he may already be committed. The beauty of the clause from the operator's point of view is that his own driver, whom he will presumably still have to pay, can be transferred to another vehicle and his licence disc can be transferred to it. It would be within the bounds of possibility that he could hire or buy another vehicle to operate while his damaged vehicle was being repaired. Of course the vehicle that he hired or bought would have to have the necessary certification as a safe vehicle. But I am assuming that we are trying to help the genuine operator, and he would be a man who would obtain a safe, certified
	<span class='label label-info column'>1270</span>
vehicle. He might hire from another operator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is exploring a deep case, because if we explore the case of a councillor diligently doing his duty and serving on committees late at night, as people in public service do— [	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "Why?"]—if hon. Members do not know why, they should not be here. If we are to explore that case to its ultimate conclusion it raises a fundamental point if clause 23 is withdrawn, as we understand it, for it has not been disputed. If we explore the avenue that my right hon. Friend went down, where we have the councillor sitting in committee and one of his three vehicles is taken off the road, but because he has a duty to the public he sends another vehicle, is the disc transferable? Are the public covered? If that second vehicle is subsequently stopped, on what basis is it stopped? This surely is the fundamental dispute about discs that we are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As is usual with my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) he has grasped what is a complication arising from an argument that I was attempting to state in the starkest simplicity by using a relatively simple example. I take my hon. Friend's valid point and I shall try to explore it in so far as it has a direct bearing on the argument I am trying to advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed that at least one Opposition Member interjected from a sedentary position with the word "Why" when my hon. Friend referred to the councillor late at night whom I had chosen for the example.
I shall explain briefly why my hon. Friend and I tend to use that example. Many Opposition Members have had council experience. Also I was involved last weekend on Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning talking to Labour councillors who are members of transport committees. Their views were very interesting, and their fears about what will happen to the services that they are trying to plan or run in their areas if the Bill is enacted would make even the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary blush, and that takes a lot of doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that if a vehicle in a small fleet is damaged the operator should have the advantage, if he is a genuine man, of being able to transfer his old licence
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0693">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1271</span>
provision, be it disc or otherwise, to another bona fide public service vehicle which has been certified as being safe for running.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central. In the examination of the clause the Minister and we are trying to see how far it is possible to separate the requirement of operator licensing from the requirement of ensuring that a public service vehicle is safe. If we could ensure that by separating the operator licensing requirement, which is involved in running the vehicle, from the requirement of seeing that any public service vehicle on the road is safe, many of our fears about this form of clause would disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, even if the Minister has scepticism about other aspects of our approach, that he will take this suggestion seriously. If we can do this, it will meet one of his objectives. We know the Minister wants to cut down the amount of administration and what he calls the bureaucracy involved in the licensing system. We share that objective. He also wants to ensure that in cutting down the administration and bureaucracy he does not do so in a way that will put the public at risk by taking away safeguards which ensure that public service vehicles on the road are safe, in so far as certain procedures ensure that safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a damaged vehicle has to go off the road quickly and another has to replace and be run by an operator who has been licensed because he is competent and reliable, the only additional safeguard that we need is that referred to by my hon. Friend, namely that the vehicle is safe, and the question that he asked about how we could be sure that it was a safe vehicle is crucial. We must pursue that in relation to the operator's licence. If we can ensure that the vehicle that he picks up is safe, the argument holds good. If it is not, my argument falls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that we can make that safeguarding provision, there is an advantage in having the flexibility of being able to shift the O licence qualification, whether disc or otherwise, from one vehicle to another. The operator—this councillor who happens to be an operator—has been licensed to run a fleet of a certain size, say, three vehicles, and we are finding a way in which he can keep three vehicles on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1272</span>
road to discharge his duty to his employees—keep his drivers and mechanics working—and to the public with the scheduled service that he runs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another way in which operators might try to cover that contingency, which would also be aided by this flexible O licensing system. When an operator has a slightly larger fleet than that of the councillor of whom I spoke—say a fleet of 10 or 12 vehicles—we might consider it worth while, in certain circumstances, to have a vehicle standing by. It might be a vehicle which he does not always use on regular or scheduled services, but which he uses occasionally for excursions, and so on. Nevertheless it would be a vehicle which he considered worth having certified as a safe public service vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He would not necessarily want at all times to have that vehicle covered within the maximum requirements if he was not going to maintain facilities in his garage and make arrangements to be able to continue to maintain a number of vehicles for operation. If, with an operator's licence and a maximum of 12 vehicles, he could have a standby 13th vehicle on to which he could transfer the O licence of the damaged or temporarily unroadworthy bus, that would be an advantage to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Committee, therefore, that from the operator's viewpoint it would be an asset. It would enable him to keep a somewhat older vehicle to be used mainly for just such emergencies, but one which would be adequate and safe for short periods of use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interchangeable disc system envisaged in the clause would meet that situation, and it is with that in mind that many operators would—if the clause were carried—like the emphasis to be placed on the general disc rather than on the specific vehicle disc, because I readily acknowledge that the clause allows both types.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that the Confederation of Passenger Transport has expressed to me the view that the safety aspects of the vehicle should, if possible, be dealt with separately from the qualifications to operate the vehicle, so it is a view held by a considerable number of highly reputable operators. The confederation would not express that view if that were not so. It does not matter how many faces the Parliamentary Secretary pulls. If he wants to stand up and challenge me and say that the Confederation of Passenger Transport does not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0694">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1273</span>
express the views of operators generally, I shall be happy to argue with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The certificate of fitness is a subsidiary element of the public service vehicle lience. With O licensing there would be an opportunity to make a distinction between the safety requirement of the vehicle and the operating requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be another benefit in this arrangement. If the disc which indicates the roadworthiness of the vehicle following its annual inspection—and I welcome that decision and congratulate the Minister, because it is an excellent provision—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. Friend leaves the safety question may I ask whether he agrees that there is another aspect? In the event of a vehicle breaking down and the operator, in seeking to do a public service, brings in another vehicle but does not display a disc, against whom does the person travelling in the second vehicle claim in the unfortunate event of an accident? Is there not an insurance angle here? The second vehicle arrives, and in good faith the passengers transfer to it. An accident then occurs. The second vehicle may not carry the name of the operator. If there is no disc and no name and address, against whom do the passengers claim? That is an extremely difficult situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard at great length about the Government's concern for the travelling public. Is not this, a point that is worth exploring further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not just a point that is worth exploring further, it is an infinitely better point than the one that I was making and I shall seek to address myself to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances that I described, the worthy councillor running the three buses at least had the time overnight to make his arrangements. Whilst that might be a very difficult situation for the worthy councillor it is nothing like so difficult as that which he would have faced had a messenger come to him in the committee room at the town hall and said "Councillor Jones, you are wanted on the phone. One of your buses has broken down and stopped at the roadside".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the situation that has been seized upon by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), with his usual perspicacity. Once again he has demonstrated to us the way in which he follows so closely the argu-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1274</span>
ments in Committee and seizes upon the vital points. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. If Councillor Jones rang up another operator and said "Do you have a bus with a PSV licence and a certificate saying that it is safe to operate and has passed its annual test which you can hire to me so that I can send it out to where one of my buses has broken down?", the passengers would accept the lift, and if the second bus got into trouble they would have no indication of whom they could claim against because the bus would show somebody else's name, somebody else's plate, and no disc. The argument for the transferable disc is much stronger in the case described by my hon. Friend than in the more general case that I was advancing. I am most grateful to him for his assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be a further benefit in having an arrangement for the disc indicating roadworthiness, following annual inspection, to be displayed at one point on the vehicle, in addition to the vehicle excise duty disc on the vehicle. The present requirement for those two discs is a source of concern—I know that the Minister will wish to enlighten the Committee on this—because the vehicle licensing centre at Swansea has to deal with large batches of vehicles at one time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice among the many people who visit us from time to time because of their great interest in our proceedings one who may have an interest in the licensing centre at Swansea. I shall therefore frame my remarks with a certain degree of circumspection. However, it is a fact that a number of major operators are unable to obtain discs from the centre for some time after the discs are due because the centre is unable to cope with bulk applications. The Minister is well aware of that and could enlighten the Committee on the subject. I know that he will not challenge what I am saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put two ideas to the Committee. I hope that the second will be helpful to the Minister and to the Committee. I also hope that my first suggestion will not be thought unworthy of an hon. Member of this House. It is that if the Minister abolishes the need to have discs he may actually be solving his Ministry's staffing problems. He has a serious staffing problem in Swansea, and he may wish to make a contribution to the Government's manpower savings which will at the same time get him out of a staffing problem. To achieve that end he should do away with the require-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0695">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1275</span>
ment for licence discs. The Opposition agree that that requirement can serve an important and useful purpose—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that if the Minister procedes with his intention to withdraw the clause the public in remote areas of the highlands and islands of Scotland will be at risk? It is likely that extremely old and rather dubious vehicles will be brought into use. Does my right hon. Friend further agree that there are peculiar circumstances surrounding the operation of public service vehicle operators' licences in the islands of Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been suggested to me from time to time that some peculiar operations do go on in the highlands and islands. My direct experience of those occurred in an arena far removed from that of public service vehicle operation. It occurred, unfortunately, in the area of pay policy when I was at the Department of Employment. One of my Department's inspectors went to investigate a rather strange problem in that area. I shall not bore the Committee with the details, but the report that I received convinced me that peculiar things can go on up there. In spite of the fact that 50 per cent. of the blood that flows in my veins is Scottish, I think that it would be better if my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) were to develop that theme rather than that I should do so to honour his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the idea which I thought might be helpful to the Minister and to the Committee. It is clear that the Minister wishes to get rid of a disc. He said so. I wish to suggest a way in which he could get rid of one of the discs and still retain the advantage of the flexible O licence system. I suggest that he consolidates the vehicle test and the excise duty discs. He could reduce the number of discs by one and wrap together the annual payment of duty and the safety test, without incurring any of the problems that would be involved in withdrawing the O licence disc.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another suggestion has arisen from the industry. I do not know whether it has reached the Minister's ears. It is that public service vehicles should have distinctive registration plates. The classic example cited was that the first bus to have such plates would be given the number BUS 12345. That would be another way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vehicles which must have a certificate of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1276</span>
fitness to show that they are safe public service vehicles, and which should be covered by the licence of an efficient operator, are designed to run for a long time on our roads. They involve considerable capital expenditure on the part of operators—possibly £60,000 or £70,000— but they are designed to run for a long time. The public tend to look at the letter suffix on the registration plate and think "My, that's an old banger", whereas in practice the vehicle may be extremely well maintained to the best possible safety standards. I put it to the Minister that there may be some merit in that idea, too. But in the main I insist that there is a considerable operator advantage—to put it no higher than that—in having the flexible O licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I speak briefly about new clause 13 which we are discussing with clause stand part? Much has been said—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend has put a better argument for the clause than the Minister did for taking it out. But to exploit the matter a little further, is not there a case for saying that the public service examiner will have under his jurisdiction random checks in the interest of public safety? The Government have stated 	<i>ad nauseam</i> that they wish to safeguard the public. How will the examiner know which vehicle to stop without the benefit of a disc?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be very easy if the vehicle belonged to United Bus Service. However, let us take the case that my right hon. Friend put so clearly about a breakdown. If another vehicle that had no disc were hired, how would the examiner know whether he was right to stop it? Will not the clause lead to a degeneration in the service that is provided for the public? Would my right hon. Friend dwell on that matter a little? It develops the point that he has been making for a considerable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly; that enlarge son the point that I have been making— although I rather resent the statement that I have been making it for a considerable time. I have been trying to develop my argument with such precis and such ability to frame matters concisely as I can retain at this time of night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's point opens up another rather large area related to the question of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0696">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1277</span>
a separate disc. As my hon. Friend has spotted, clearly, if any Ministers, certifying officers or examiners stopped a vehicle in the circumstances which he has outlined— that is, it had been hired at very short notice to take over—they would have to be forgiven for presuming that it was a vehicle owned, and thus operated, by the person whose name was painted on the side. It is one thing to move a disc from one vehicle to another. It is another to have to spray over the operator's name at five minutes' notice and paint on another. Clearly, that is an impracticable proposition. It is a major area which my hon. Friend might wish to explore to our advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I wish to turn briefly to the new clause. If it is added to the Bill at the appropriate time—I realise that we cannot vote on it now, but will do that later—it will be a very valuable provision. I urge the Minister to consider that it will be completely within his control. The way in which the new clause is framed is such that he—and he alone; there would be no overriding control by the House—would be able to prescribe completely the contents of the notice that would appear in a bus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would enable the Minister to emphasise such powers as are appropriate to draw the matter to the attention of the public, so that they could feel involved, that they had some right of redress and that traffic commissioners did not exist in ivory towers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1278</span>
I have discussed the matter with my hon. Friends who tabled this new clause. We had in mind the advisability of drawing two matters to the attention of the travelling public. The first is that the traffic commissioner is there for the public to contact on matters that are in his area of responsibility. We considered stating briefly certain of his specific powers dealing with problems or offences likely to be observed by the travelling public. That could be a useful provision which, in itself, would not depend upon whether the clause stands part of the Bill. For reasons that I argued earlier I think that it would be better for the clause to stand part than for it to disappear. It would have considerable advantages of flexibility of operation for operators, but I do not feel that that is crucial to the new clause issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause does not stand in my name in any shape or form. I am most sceptical about this whole matter. The powers of the traffic commissioners are likely to be voluminous. I have never read them. Who will provide the summary and what will it look like on a notice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. To support the clause one has to show that the notice is likely to be read and on being read to have a useful effect. I hope that it would look important, readable, be in large print and draw attention to propositions of public concern. I know that that is not a full or direct answer, but, frankly, it is the best that I can do, bearing in mind that the matter is not clear in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that a weakness of the new clause is that it may not achieve the purpose that I originally thought it would achieve. When I first read the new clause, as it referred to the notice being:
	<br><blockquote><p>"fixed and exhibited … in the prescribed manner"</p></blockquote>
I thought that, like all other references to "prescribed" in our road transport—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman does not need to explain to us his communion with himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me commune with the Committee rather than myself on the second line of the new clause, which refers to the notice:
	<br><blockquote><p>"being fixed and exhibited in the vehicle in the prescribed manner".</p></blockquote>
I take it that I am in order to presume that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0697">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1279</span>
if the new clause is accepted the word "prescribed" will bear the same meaning as it does in other parts of the Bill, which refer to matters being prescribed in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore a point for consideration whether what is prescribed is merely the manner in which the notice is to be fixed and exhibited or the content of the notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I might make a criticism—I hope a not unfair one—of my hon. Friends who tabled the new clause, it is that there remains some doubt about whether the regulations would state only how the notice was to be fixed and exhibited and would not necessarily control the contents, which begs the question of what controls the contents. I hope that that will not be regarded as a destructive criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am totally in sympathy with the new clause and I hope that the Minister will respond to it in the spirit in which my hon. Friends tabled it. When the Minister has explained why he believes clause 23 should not stand part of the Bill—we shall listen to that explanation with great interest—I hope that he will give us his views on the value of the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long and interesting debate. The point of the stand part debate was put most succinctly by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness, just before our recent adjournment, when he said that the debate was basically about doing away with a disc. That is exactly what it is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I think of outsiders observing our proceedings or reading of them, I sometimes wonder what they will make of the transport policy of the Labour Party, with the great Laurel and Hardy act between the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) on some of their proposals that lead only to an addition of testrictions, regulations, discs, bureaucracy and everything that will make things more difficult for the operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly the objective behind requiring operators' discs to be displayed on all vehicles being used for hire or reward is to provide a means of identifying licensed vehicles. The argument is that requiring the disc will in some way help enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had consultations with the traffic commissioners on this point and considered it ourselves. Our initial reaction was that discs would probably be of assistance.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1280</span>
However, as I said some hours ago, the licensing system where discs are used—for heavy goods vehicles and the motor tax, which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned—is a different system from that under discussion in the clause stand part debate. The system is aimed not at individual vehicles, but at operators and their suitability for running and maintaining a number of vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore it seems reasonable to consult the industry to see whether there may be simpler ways of identifying licensed vehicles. There would be considerable saving in the work of operators and traffic commissioners' staff if that could be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If administrative savings could be made as far as the operators and the traffic commissioners are concerned, all members of the Committee would welcome it. We have had consultations with the traffic commissioners, and their advice is that the system is unnecessary. Our consideration also leads us to that conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is discussing the point that I raised. Apart from the traffic commissioners and the Government, I wonder whether there are other organisations which, in the operation of the licence proposed by the Foster report, are strongly for retaining this disc or symbol—organisation such as the police or other authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. We considered and consulted on the matter. I examined the clause, having seen the system, and asked whether it was necessary. We decided that it is not. It is a straight choice, with which the Opposition may disagree. We can include a clause that we do not believe to be necessary or we can delete it. I believe that the useful addition to efficiency and the reduction of bureaucracy, restrictions and regulations will be worthwhile to, and welcomed by, the operators.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman address himself to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle on Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) put to me—that is, how does one identify the operator where a bus has been hastily substituted for one normally used by that operator, with the other operator's name on the side? How can it be identified to check whether it is running within an operator's licence requirement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0698">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1281</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We already have powers under the construction and use regulations to enforce the painting of the operator's name and licence number on the bus. If anything further needs to be done to reinforce those powers, we shall consider it. However, I must tell the right hon. Gentleman that I do not believe that this sudden fixation about discs will solve the problem. It is a straight choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard from the Opposition the demands for piling bureaucracy upon bureaucracy and for over-identification beyond over-identification. They will want the discs all sprayed red in a minute. My right hon. Friend has given an indication that he considers the law as it exists within the meaning of the Acts to be adequate for all sorts of identification and that he wishes to reduce the bureaucratic burden upon the British public, the British travelling public and those who have to operate the service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we can now move into top gear on the Government side of the Committee. We are all present and ready to listen to the arguments. There is a straight choice in this matter. If the Opposition want, in their wisdom or otherwise, to resist our attempt to take restrictions and bureaucracy out of the Bill, that is a matter for them. That comes as no great surprise—the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends are already leading the Labour Party into the most curious of all the transport policies which it has pursued over the last 20 years. They are taking the Labour Party back to the Stone Age in terms of transport policies. If they want to do that, that is a matter entirely for them. However, they will not be thanked by anyone. As matters stand, the traffic commissioners do not want that. I do not believe that the operators want that. The Government do not want that. If Opposition Members want that that is something on which they can vote in the Division that will doubtless follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal briefly with the other, more moderate and reasonable point put, characteristically, not by the Opposition Front Bench spokesman but by the hon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Members for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson). The purpose of that amendment was, to use the hon. Gentlemen's words, to improve consumer interests. Obviously, we have sympathy with the hon. Gentlemen's important point. I do no want to go through the aims and objects of the Bill, but we clearly believe that the introduction of more competition in transport will act in the interests of consumers. We also believe that the first responsibility in consumer affairs does not lie with the traffic commissioners but with the bus company. I think that the transport users' committees, which at present are excluded from such considerations, may well come within our consideration.</p>
	<p>I advise the hon. Gentleman that the conclusion that we have so far come to on his amendment is that we believe it to be unnecessary to give details of the traffic commissioners in whose areas the vehicles are to operate. The drafting is defective and the clause is not workable. The clause is defective because it refers to road service operations licences in respect of a vehicle used on the roads as a stage express or contract carriage and neither operators' licences nor road service licences relate to a vehicle. If we thought that even the reference to traffic commissioners was an appropriate one, which I do not believe, the provision, in the Government's view, is defective in any event.</p>
	<p>To sum up the argument on new clause 13, we fail to see the purpose of the amendment; we can see no benefit accruing to anyone from requiring the powers of the traffic commissioners to be summarised and displayed on a vehicle and, in any event, we believe it to be totally impractical. The clause should be rejected and I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will take my advice and negate it.</p>

	<p>slightly overawed by the heavy mob in the Public Gallery.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that all members of the Committee will remember that it is not the custom in the House, or in any of its Committees, to refer to the Public Gallery, to visitors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment in terms of employees' rights. I shall try to put the thrust of the amendment in as few words as possible. I have not the art of speaking at great length— unfortunately. It is a dying art form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is also linked, as I shall argue, with the issue of freedom of the individual. I hope, when I argue that second principle, particularly in relation to employees' rights, that I shall evoke a ready response from the Government Benches. This is an important amendment, but it is a probing [amendment in that it seeks clarification of the precise meaning of subsection (1). Perhaps, when the Minister replies, he can clear up a few doubts in my mind about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (1) the important words are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or of any person proposed to be engaged as transport manager whose repute and competence are relied on in connection with the application".</p></blockquote>
I have already told the Committee that I am not one for small print. But I should like to know whether:
	<br><blockquote><p>"whose repute and competence are relied on in connection with the application"</p></blockquote>
refers specifically—I think it does, if I understand the clauses of that long sentence correctly—to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person proposed to be engaged as transport manager".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps, when the Minister replies, he will say whether those words refer specifically to the transport manager only—because the transport manager seems to be the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0700">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1285</span>
subject of what is nearly a separate sentence—or whether they refer to employees or agents of the operator. On the meaning of the phrase I have mentioned, beginning "whose repute", turns an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it refers only to the manager, there is a point at issue. Perhaps the Minister will tell me the layman's interpretation of "a relevant conviction", because whenever one reads any Bill, whichever part one reads refers one to something else, and when one reads that something else it refers one to something else. However, let me make the first reference.
	<br><blockquote><p>"'relevant conviction' means a conviction (other than a spent conviction) of any offence prescribed for the purposes of this Part, or of an offence under the law of another member State, or of Northern Ireland, corresponding to an offence so prescribed".</p></blockquote>
1.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reading that, I admit that I do not quite know what a relevant offence is. It is probably denned in another clause, somewhere. I have not noticed it. Perhaps the Minister can tell me. I am genuinely puzzled as to the meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the substance of the amendment. If there is an employee who works for the operator of a firm who has the operator's licence, and that employee has a humble part to play in the firm, surely any relevant offence concerning him does not have to be reported. That is surely unnecessary. I have heard a good many arguments about bureaucracy, formfilling, and who has to be reported, but if it is necessary only to report any employee who is involved in the substantial operation of running the business, the sooner we insert the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"whose services would be required in any operation requiring the licence"</p></blockquote>
into the clause, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consider the case of an operator of substance—for instance, the National Bus Company, which employs all sorts of people. If an employee with a humble role committed an offence and disappeared the next day, it would not very much alter the running of the service one way or the other. If an operator is required to report any relevant offence, whatever that may be, committed by every humble person in an operation of any size, it is a bureaucratic waste of time. I hope that this argument appeals to the Minister. I see him taking advice. I hope that he will give me the benefit of that advice, because his knowledge of the Bill, and that of his officials, is much
	<span class='label label-info column'>1286</span>
greater than mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to my second point. If, between this time span, when the offence is to be reported, a person has committed a relevant offence, and in the meantime—within the prescribed period—he has been transferred to another post, involving a different function, does the offence still have to be reported? If an employee of an operator of substance has committed a relevant offence, surely the boss can say "All right, you have done it. You are transferred from this moment because we cannot tolerate you committing the offence and helping to run a significant operation for the public". It is possible to be demoted in that way: one day a king, the next a scullion. But is it still incumbent on the operator to report the offence? Surely, clause 24(1), without the amendment that I seek to insert, will involve the operator in a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 225 and 227 are consequential on amendment No. 224. As I have already covered the argument, I shall not weary the Committee any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) has clearly pointed out, this is a serious matter. It is serious because there is an impact on individuals. I should not back any proposition in a Bill which gave to someone a duty to inform someone else of a person who has been convicted unless that was absolutely necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person who has been convicted and paid his fine or served his sentence will normally want to ensure that his conviction is as little advertised as possible, He will certainly not welcome any Committee of this House passing legislation requiring someone to write to someone else in a public position and tell him of that conviction, particularly if the person who has to be informed is someone upon whom his job depends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are seeking to do is not to detract from the power of the commissioner by carrying an amendment to stop him being notified where it is appropriate he should be notified of someone having a conviction, but seeking to make absolutely sure that no one whose work is not in any way relevant to the operation covered by the licence is caught up in this provision. I hope that it will be appreciated that in this Bill we are attempting to make provision both for those operations where the employer is engaged only in public service
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0701">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1287</span>
vehicle operations and those operations where the employer has public service vehicle operations as but one part of his total service. We are trying to encompass them both in the same part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to assist the hon. Gentleman. As far as I can see this clause applies only to a person who has applied for a PSV operator's licence. We are not talking about the whole of the Bill at this stage. We are not even talking about the whole clause, but an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever, Mr. English, I am most grateful for your assistance. I shall show that I shall take immediate heed and advantage of it by making it quite clear that I am concerned in this case about the applicant for the public service vehicle operator's licence who is an employer employing people not only in the operation of public service vehicles but in doing other things as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness—I do beg his pardon for referring to him as a Friend. I was in error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we are all colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, so we are, in the greatest of good friendship and good col-leagueship. But, if I read this clause aright, it not only refers to employees but to agents and to relevant convictions which have to be defined. There is a distinction to be made between employees and agents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should imagine that in this context an agent might be a solicitor, an accountant, even a bank manager or an agent provocateur. How does one read this amendment as being commonsense? Should it not be repudiated as a spurious amendment because it has no meaning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. If that were true it would have been ruled out of order and would not have appeared on the selection list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not object to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) calling me "friend". I do not know whether he is of the Quaker persuasion, but I understand that the term "friend" has extensive meanings and I hope
	<span class='label label-info column'>1288</span>
that it will stretch across the Committee Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is serious and deals with a serious matter. An employee may find that his employer is notifying the traffic commissioner that the worker has been found guilty of an offence and has been convicted. That might have a serious effect on the employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was interrupted I was about to say that some operators who apply for their Hence have within their employ some people who are engaged in their bus service operation and some engaged in doing other things. The narrow point of the amendment is to ensure that the only convictions notified to the traffic commissioner as relevant convictions will be convictions of employees engaged in the transport operation and not of the others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or agents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it applies to agents. The amendment does not necessarily rest upon that. If the agent is a transport agent dealing with public service vehicles, I should have thought that it flowed automatically from the logic of the clause that his conviction for a relevant offence would have to be notified. The amendment would not prevent the employer from notifying such a conviction to the traffic commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operation of the amendment hangs on the definition of "relevant conviction". Does the definition of a "relevant conviction" as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any offence prescribed for the purposes of this Part"</p></blockquote>
mean that the Minister will have to say which convictions we are talking about? Will the Minister have to prescribe convictions in regulations? The Minister will have a difficult, responsible and sensitive task and I am sure that in undertaking it, he would do only those things that were strictly relevant. It would be useful to have some guidance from him on what he has in mind to prescribe as "relevant".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difficulty in that the applicant for a licence will be influenced by the knowledge that he has to comply with this requirement in the courts. In some cases an employer would be reluctant to put himself in the position of having failed to comply with the section. If there were any doubt in his mind, he might give himself the benefit of the doubt by making sure that he had notified the conviction, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1289</span>
could be to the detriment of the employee. If doubt is exercised in that way, it may result in someone having his conviction notified to the commissioner in circumstances under which my hon. Friends submit that it should not be notified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a sensitive point to those who have been convicted. Although we want the traffic commissioners to be informed when the conviction is relevant, we do not want them to be informed when the conviction could not affect the efficient or safe running of the operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you pointed out, Mr. English, we are addressing ourselves to a narrow point. I do not seek to detain the Committee. My right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) attempted to show concern about the type of convictions that will be reported to the authority and whether "employee" or "agent" could mean anyone involved in the transport business. The Minister indicated that whoever is involved has to be involved in the transport business. It is a conviction relevant to the transport business, in this case a bus service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to amend subsections (1) and (2) to the same effect. One refers to an operator who is making an application, and to convictions of his agent, transport manager, or employee who may be seen as his transport manager. The other applies to the holder of an existing licence. We wish the Minister to assure us that a relevant conviction refers to the operation of the business and that it applies only to the transport manager and, in some circumstances, to the holder of the operator's licence where he is not the transport manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the matter of relevant conviction, I wish to ask the Minister a question. It relates to what has been a source of concern, to my friends in the transport industry. I recall one man who had been convicted of speeding. This had affected his occupation as a lorry driver. It brings to mind all manner of possible offences relevant to the operation of a transport business which could lead to an endorsement of a licence and have consequential effects upon the professional position of a transport manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1290</span>
If, in his capacity as a private citizen on his way to work, the transport manager were stopped by a policeman and found to have a worn tyre on his car, or, more seriously, were found to be drunk and incapable in charge of his car, any convictions would be relevant in that they would affect him in his capacity as transport manager, even though they occurred when he was not directly involved in the operation of the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an anomaly that causes great concern, particularly among lorry drivers, who on a night out have committed a motoring offence and then have had difficulties with their HGV licences. I am sure the Minister hears of many such cases. I shall transfer that principle to this case. A transport manager could, on his way to or from work commit a traffic offence serious enough to merit endorsement of his licence. In that case it would be a conviction with a time limit when considered for a totting-up purposes. Would it be a relevant conviction for the traffic commissioner to consider if it were discovered that the manager, on a social occasion, had committed a traffic offence that consequently affected the operation of the business? Does that affect directly his competence as a transport manager outside the area of direct transport, and thus his ability to carry on the business as a transport business?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The direct answer to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East is that certainly the speeding conviction would not be a relevant conviction. The other example that he gave would also not fall within the terms of what we are talking about under subsection (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I go back one stage? The provision is necessary basically to ensure that the commissioners do not grant a licence to someone who does not satisfy the good repute condition, because they were unaware of the conviction that occurred while they were dealing with the application. I think that there would be general agreement for intention of the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that convictions are notified to the commissioners only where they are directly related to the carrying of passengers for which the O licence was granted. That was the direct intent of the amendment, but I feel that that is not necessary and I shall tell the Committee why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present wording is certainly all-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0703">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1291</span>
embracing and I suppose it could be criticised on those grounds. It is aimed not at the reputable operator, but at the more dubious ones who take advantage of any loophole given by a narrow drafting, and, after all, it is the whole burden of the Opposition's argument that their concern is not the majority of reputable operators, but the small number of disreputable ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The safeguard is that the relevant convictions, which really go to the heart of what was said by the hon. Member for Ipswich, the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East will be prescribed in regulations and they will all be relevant to transport. Let me give some examples of what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unlikely that an employee or agent will have been convicted of an offence other than in his role in transport operations. Relevant convictions are a feature of the present law and have not, as far as I know, caused any difficulty. It is clearly important that where employees are engaged in transport business activities which can attract convictions, the commissioners should be notified. I should have thought that, again, that was common ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of convictions that we are talking about—the draft list that we are preparing, which I am happy to disclose to the Committee—are offences under the Transport Act 1980, which is what we hope the Bill will become, such as the use of vehicles for which a road service licence is required without having previously obtained such a licence, contravention of any conditions attached to a road service licence, failure to supply within a prescribed time anything required to be supplied upon application for a road service licence and, thumbing my way through the list, forgery of an operator's identity. No, that will not be a relevant conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More reflections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, It is actually a reflection which has ceased to apply to that specific conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other relevant convictions which come under the Road Traffic Act 1960 include an unlicensed person driving a public service vehicle, the employment of such a person, and contravention of regulations as to conduct of persons licensed to act as drivers of public service vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1292</span>
The point that I make and the assurance that I give is that, first, we are talking about regulations. Secondly, we are considering convictions relevant to the transport undertaking. Given that this is a system that has not caused problems in the past, there would be no great objection from either side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that information. He made clear that he intended to prescribe in such a way as to ensure that the only convictions of which the commissioner has to be notified concern those offences that he should properly take into account if the person who applied for a licence was going to employ someone who had committed those offences within the transport part of his operation. However, that is not what the clause says. It would be the effect of the amendment, but under the clause an employer who is the applicant for an operator's licence, who has employees other than those engaged in the transport part of the operation, would also have to make notification if they had committed those offences. I do not see why it should be necessary for the employer to inform the traffic commissioner of convictions in such a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the very person liable to be caught up in the notification procedure is not working in the transport part of the business. Having committed the offence and been found guilty, he knows full well that it is far better for him not to try to be employed in the transport part of the operation, for the time being anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems altogether wrong if the employee has chosen voluntarily to seek employment in another part of the business—he may be doing something entirely different, but still work for the employer who has to apply for the operator's licence. If he works in another area which has nothing to do with the running of buses—perhaps he is just engaged in packing cases—why should his conviction have to be notified? That is the heart and point of our amendment. It seems to me altogether wrong that the employer should be obliged to do it, and that the employee should suffer in those circumstances. The facts that the Minister has given us and the sort of offences that he has in mind and which he has specified so clearly in some way add point to our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would not want the employer to feel that his application should be justified
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0704">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1293</span>
merely because he is employing somebody to do something unconnected with the public transport part of his business, or that that person had jeopardised the business. Incidentally, he might also refuse to employ people who have been convicted of traffic offences in a non-traffic part of his operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not belieye that the Minister has quite seized the point. I hope that he will reflect on the matter. This is a serious and valid point and we are not trying to undermine the commissioners in any way nor to make the Minister's job more difficult in prescribing the regulations. We appreciate what he said to us about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are trying, first, to protect individuals from the advertising of their convictions in any way that is not necessary. Secondly, we are trying to ensure that the employer will not be put in the difficult position of notifying when such notification should not have any influence whatever on the granting of a licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment concerns the reporting of convictions. If convictions are to be reported, I should like to know what record is to be kept of them by the traffic commissioners. The Rehabilitation of Offenders Act seeks to limit any reporting of convictions whatsoever because if in the course of time the information turns up in any inconvenient place it may prove a very great embarrassment to the person concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting point which may well be appropriate to the clause stand part debate, but I think that he is straying outside the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to point out the difference that the amendment would make to the clause. Of course, there may be a relevant conviction that the traffic commissioners should know about. But there are two relevancies involved. First, the conviction must be relevant. Secondly, the Opposition believe it important that the employment should be relevant to a passenger transport operation. The operator may be engaged in a number of different business activities. Is he really expected to inform the traffic commissioners of relevant convictions of people who are in no way connected with
	<span class='label label-info column'>1294</span>
the passenger transport operation but who happen to be his agents for other activities? As I read it, the clause is very wide indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will certainly be some small operators who have only a few employees and whose sole business activity is running buses, in which case it is right that all relevant convictions of their employees should be notified. But as I understand it, the clause would also catch all employees of a larger business engaged in several activities, an important one of which is a bus operation. It is surely irrelevant for that employer to bog the traffic commissioners down with unnecessary information about the convictions of employees in no way connected with his buses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the concern of the Committee. Indeed, I share that concern. We certainly do not want anything other than relevant convictions to be taken into account. It is really a question of drafting. As the hon. Gentleman has said, our provision is drafted more widely than the Opposition's amendment. That was done deliberately, because we believe that if it is narrowly drafted it will be possible for people who are not perhaps directly employed to evade the restrictions of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we seek to do—and I think that this is common ground between the two sides—is to prevent the small number of people who want to evade this aspect of the law from doing so. We therefore took the judgment that it would be wise not to limit it as much as the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am perfectly prepared to look at the point again if that would be of assistance to the Committee. I understand the Committee's concern, and I am happy to consider the matter further. My advice at this stage, however, would certainly be that, whilst our provision is undoubtedly drawn more widely than the Opposition amendment, we believe that that is necessary to protect the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his undertaking to look at the matter again, because I do not see how the public are protected by the commissioners knowing that a person working in some part of an employer's operation that has nothing at all to do with public transport had been convicted of some offence. It can only be relevant to the consideration of whether an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0705">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1295</span>
applicant should get an operator's licence if anyone engaged in the public transport part of his operation has been found guilty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition think that the provision has implications for basic civil rights. It threatens to jeopardise the chances of employment of people who have been convicted and have served their sentence or paid their fine. If the clause goes through in its present form it is almost certain that such people will be unlikely to get jobs in firms any part of whose operations are involved with running public service transport. It could result in employers questioning prospective employees: "Have you had any convictions for relevant offences?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. But it will mean relevant not to the job in question but to transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I will not have this. If the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) reflects, he may realise that he ought not to have said what he did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. English, that I responded to a sedentary intervention. But there is a serious issue here. In this context "relevant" does not mean relevant to the job for which someone may apply to a man who runs a public transport service as well as other sides to his business. All the jobs in that business, whether involved with transport or not, would be affected. Under the clause as it stands, employers would be liable to ask people seeking jobs as, say, packing-case assemblers, whether they had any convictions relevant to this part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition do not seek to restrict those hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During debates on issues such as this, which are certainly not matters of party political controversy, I am only too happy to give way. I welcome other hon. Members joining in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to apologise, Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1296</span>
English, for my sedentary interjection. I was trying to point out that the whole content of the clause is based on "relevant" convictions. I apologise if there was any misunderstanding of my interjection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I very much appreciate what the hon. Gentleman has said. His statement that we are concerned with relevant convictions is valid. But I have to insist that "relevant" should mean relevant only to that part of the total employment of the operator which is concerned with running public service vehicles. It should not mean relevant to his other activities. If the fact that he employs someone in another part of his business means that he has to notify, the employer may feel perfectly justified in asking every applicant for a job, including those interested in the part of the business that had nothing to do with transport, whether he has one of those convictions which would be relevant only to the public transport side of the employer's business. The applicant for the job could resent that and so could certain trade unions on behalf of their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is serious. I hope that it will not be the subject of difference across the Committee. I appreciate that the Minister has undertaken to look at it again, and I hope that he will do so. We would be happy for the Minister to reframe and tighten the amendment while still fulfilling our main purpose of preventing the involvement of employees not concerned with transport in provisions relating to only the transport side of an employer's undertaking. We hope to hear from the Minister again on the subject before Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It gives me great pleasure to move the amendment in the early hours of the morning. As Opposition Members we seek to be constructive and I address my remarks to the Minister. Being an accomplished lip reader, I understand that we may have the pleasure, at 3 o'clock in the morning, of being joined by the Parliamentary Secret-

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman explain why the prescence of the Parliamentary Secretary is relevant to the words

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your superior judgment, Mr. English, but I have always been led to believe that two heads are better than one. If I were talking to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, I should be talking to two heads and not one and hoping that if a point did not go into one head it would go into the other. With that I shall now turn, in a constructive manner, as my hon. Friends and I always do, to deal with the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the clause as at present drafted there is a remarkable discrepancy. I appreciate what the Government seek to do, but there is a big difference between seeking to do something and actually attaining what one seeks. The Government seek to place before the traffic commissioners any conviction which is relevant and of which the traffic commissioners must be notified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall paint the picture clearly of where the discrepancy occurs. If I had the benefit of the bevy of talent that sits on the Minister's left hand, with innumerable writing pads and the passing of notes 	<i>ad infinitum</i> to help him in his deliberations, I would not have to explore the following point of view. But not having that bevy of talent and just being an ordinary, naive Back Bencher—[	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "Hear, hear."] At least we have agreement on one thing. Perhaps it heralds better things to come. In a minute or two we may have agreement on the amendment. If that is a foreboding of what is to come, it will be a marvellous herald to the Committee compared with what has passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Earlier you went out of your way to point out to members of the Committee that it was not proper to refer to people in the Public Gallery, no matter how tempting that might be. That is just for the record. Am I not right in saying that similar rules of procedure apply to officials who might be advising Ministers? On several occasions references have been made to such persons and I understand that it was normal to pretend that such people did not exist, no matter how much every member of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1298</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to go into details which would extend the sitting unduly, but I am reliably informed that there is a slight distinction between servants of the Crown present in their official capacity by the Minister's side and persons at the opposite end of the room.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, Mr. English, I bow to your superior wisdom, knowing as I do that you have travelled the corridors of this place—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not trespass upon my goodwill. My peripatetic actions should perhaps be left to subsequent discussion after the Committee is over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that in the interpretation clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again I bow to your superior judgment, Mr. English. If I could have made that intervention I should not have to make this speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I return to the clause, As I understand it, from reading what little literature I have, the clause requires an applicant for a PSV operator's licence to notify the traffic commissioners of any relevant—that is the first point—conviction of him, his employee, his agent or his prospective transport manager—this is relevant to the second point—that occurs between the application and its being disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I do not understand the clause properly—if I am transgressing—I hope the Minister will tell me where I am going wrong. I also understand that it requires a licence-holder to notify the commissioners of any relevant conviction of himself, his employee, or his agents and to notify the commissioners of his bankruptcy or a similar occurence or of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any change in the identity"</p></blockquote>
of his transport manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the relevance of the amendment. The key word is "conviction". Let me paint the picture as a practical man as to how it could happen. Let us consider someone applying for a licence who has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0707">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1299</span>
been to a court but who has an appeal pending. It is relevant to the clause because the operator, his manager, his employee and so on, has not been convicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the holder of the licence needs to inform the traffic commissioner only if he has been convicted. If an appeal is pending the man, his employee or his prospective transport manager has not been convicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the thinking behind the clause, an application such as this cannot deal with future events. The amendment is not asking us to deal with future events. It is asking us to deal with someone who at the time of the application has not been convicted. Why should it not deal with future events? The reason is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry, but I do not understand the last point. The amendment reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the conviction is made subject to appeal"</p></blockquote>
namely when there has been a conviction and there has been an appeal. Clearly the appeal comes after the conviction. There is no need to appeal when one has not been convicted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, Mr. English, there is a discrepancy in the words. In a court of law, is a conviction final when there is a point of appeal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. With the greatest respect, the answer is "Yes".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There, I think—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may assist the hon. Gentleman if I say that there is a clear distinction between conviction and sentence. One can be convicted without being sentenced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the position of the clause is that the conviction is not germane in a court of law, when an appeal is lodged, until that appeal is dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman will find that this is not quite the situation. I hope that he will take my word for it, because we are straying into somewhat of an irrelevance. There is a substantial point, in my view, in the amendment, and we are now discussing a rather
	<span class='label label-info column'>1300</span>
minor point that is interfering with the main point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We look to you, Mr. English, and I have to bow to your judgment because you happen to be Chairman of the Committee. That does not necessarily mean that I agree with what you say, but undoubtedly I have to bow to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevance of the amendment is important. The amendment seeks on all occasions to give the traffic commissioners all information. Not everyone, Mr. English, reading the Bill when it becomes an Act will have the undoubted legal knowledge that you have. What we seek to do is to clarify the situation. I believe that the amendment does that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill says that an applicant must inform the traffic commissioners of a conviction. What is wrong with the applicant also informing the traffic commissioners that there is a conviction and an appeal against that conviction? The Opposition believe that that would clarify the situation. We are not asking for a great deal. We ask that in no circumstances shall the traffic commissioners be misled. We say that the amendment would toughen up the situation so that there was no opportunity for the traffic commissioners to be misled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause as it is, there is a distinct possibility—I put it no higher—that the traffic commissioners would not receive all the information that, undoubtedly, the Minister wishes them to receive. I should be interested to hear what objections the Minister has to the amendment. If he is sincere—and I believe that he is—in saying that he wants the traffic commissioners to know everything that is relevant, he will gain credibility by taking the amendment as it is submitted, for it would give more teeth and more understanding to the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard only this morning about the small rural operator with three buses who may not, unlike the owner of a large undertaking, have everything at his fingertips. It is in his interests that it should be clear to him that, whether he has been convicted or has an appeal pending, it is necessary to inform the traffic commissioners of those facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may argue that the position is covered in the Bill. I oppose that argument because again and again the Opposition have sought to have clarity in the Bill. We want not only to make it clear to those who have sat night after night in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0708">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1301</span>
this Committee; we have to look at the long term as well. Undoubtedly the Bill will become an Act, and I am thinking of the time when, that being so, someone has to read it. What objection could the Minister have to accepting the amendment, which seeks to clarify matters, not to Members who sit night after night discussing the Bill, but to laymen outside who employ lawyers in a court of law? Is it not reasonable for the small rural operator to expect clarity in the clause? We may save him a vast amount of money by his not having to employ a lawyer, because we have clarified the law. The money that he saves by not going to a lawyer may be used on the transport that we so urgently need in the rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask time and again that the Minister should have the courage of his convictions. We want clarity in this matter—we do not want the traffic commissioners misled—for those who have to read and interpret the Bill when it is enacted. Can the Minister give us a concise reason why the amendment should not be part of the Bill? It will help everybody concerned. It will clear up any discrepancy and I recommend the amendment to the Committee if for no other reason that that once the Bill is enacted it will have to be read and interpreted, and the amendment adds something that will help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central has covered most of the area to which the amendment relates, but I should like to deal with a slightly narrower case that is within the scope of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a number of occasions—one hopes not too many—when somebody applying to the commissioner has to notify the conviction of an appellant. We accept the ruling that that is a conviction, irrespective of whether the person concerned has appealed. We are concerned with the case where a convicted person has appealed. Basic justice is involved. If on appeal the conviction is quashed and the court decides that the grounds of appeal were sound it would be unfair to the person concerned that he should have caused his employer not to get a licence and unfair on the employer that he should have lost the licence in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We address ourselves to a possible way of avoiding that situation by saying that a commissioner must suspend his decision until an appeal is heard. That might not be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1302</span>
a perfect way of solving the problem, but it is a genuine attempt to provide a solution to a situation which, in a limited number of cases, can be a real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is not done some employers will not take the risk. If somebody is convicted his employer may find ways of making sure that the person is not an employee when the appeal is considered, thereby putting the employer outwith the notification. That would be unfair, because it would cut across a tenet of basic justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to find a solution. My hon. Friends and I are not wedded to our own solution. We hope that the Minister will come up with a better one, but we feel that there is a problem. We want to explore the possible solutions and we want to recognise that although a person is convicted, the final decision under our system of justice may not have been made. We cannot accept that a person is liable for sentencing, and has been properly and finally found guilty until that appeal is heard.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is our concern. It has ramifications on other parts of the clause which I will not touch upon now. It would be better if at this stage the Minister advises us that he accepts that we have made a serious point and gives us his views on the amendment and whether he feels there is a better way of dealing with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness have made a serious point. The amendment basically attempts to place a requirement on traffic commissioners to suspend a decision on an application for an operator's licence in cases where the applicant has informed the commissioners of a relevant conviction, but that conviction is subject to appeal proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a substantial point, which I shall come to shortly, but the amendment as drafted is unacceptable on two grounds. First, it is fairly conclusive, but it should not relate to clause 24. I am advised that the correct place for it would be clause 20, which deals with the granting of operators' licences. Secondly, traffic commissioners, once they have been informed of a relevant conviction, be satisfied that a licence should nevertheless be granted, regardless of whether an appeal is pending. Those are two reasons why, on drafting grounds alone, the amendment is not acceptable in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0709">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1303</span>
its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have considerable sympathy with the principle behind the amendment, especially after having listened to what the hon. Gentleman said. It would be more than unfortunate if an operator were refused a licence on the ground of a relevant conviction, when, on appeal, he was found to be not guilty. Members on both sides of the Committee will have sympathy with that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we cannot accept the amendment, I am prepared to consider the matter further to see whether we cannot find a better solution on Report, or at some other stage, to meet the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. He may be right that the amendment should apply to clause 20, although I am not sure where it should go in that clause. I leave that question in abeyance for the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy that the Minister accepts the principle that this is a serious point affecting the traffic commissioners and the applicant. I rest my case, therefore, and will listen to what my hon. Friends say before considering whether to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we are agreed that this is a serious point which needs to be redressed. I can see that by applying the amendment to clause 20 we can deal with the point relating to the grant of licence, but I do not understand how that covers the notification aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, the problem flows from notification—at least in part, if not in substantial part. Presumably, it would have to be a condition imposed by clause 20 or clause 24, or a back reference, that where one was notifying—even if the power on the granting of a licence were modified by clause 20—that notification should be done in a way that allowed the specific provision in clause 20 to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for not having followed the Minister's remarks as closely as I should on the second point, but I fail to see how the licence decision will be taken in any way other than on a suspended basis. That must pose problems. The difficulty with the amendment is that it would prevent the commissioners deciding on an application until after the Appeal Court had come to its conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1304</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my right hon. Friend's argument, and I see the point at issue. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Government will put something in clause 20, which deals with the granting of the licence, but how will that cover someone who has to notify convictions under clause 24, and still has an appeal pending? That is the difficulty. Is it not possible to amend clauses 20 and 24 to take care of the case of someone who has to notify, but who still has an appeal pending?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be one way. I should be interested to hear the Minister's comments on that matter before I say more. I am sure that the Minister's views, with the benefit of any advice that he can get, will be helpful to the whole Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The options opening up from what the Minister said, if we are to avoid the granting of the licence, are the granting of a form of provisional operator's licence. Such a licence would have attached to it the condition that if the appeal did not succeed, it would be granted subject to the operator getting rid of the employee concerned and replacing him with someone with no conviction, or the commissioner saying "That conviction is not sufficiently important in relation to the job that the employee is doing. I give it to you now without conditions". Either of those solutions would avoid the difficulty of having the hung commissioner's decision and preventing the coming into operation of the operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Minister if I have not understood correctly his second point. Perhaps he will say whether that is the sort of solution that is open, and whether one of his objections to the amendment is that it hangs the decision of the commissioner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a serious matter. We seek to be fair both to the applicant and to the traffic commissioner, but another point occurs to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The holder of a PSV licence has to inform the commissioner of a conviction. There are two aspects here. The first concerns the applicant who is seeking the licence, and the second relates to someone holding a licence who also has to notify the commissioner of a conviction which may be subject to appeal. I may be straying, Mr. English, but I hope you will bear with me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0710">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

because this is an important point and we seek to be fair to everyone concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was seized of that point, but had intended to raise it on the debate on clause stand part because I had assumed that it was relevant to subsection (2)—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think we can agree with the right hon. Gentleman; he does not need to explain his reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman changes his mind. He should listen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. If the hon Gentleman wishes to interject, would he please rise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I heard what the hon. Gentleman said and I do not believe that it will be worthy of him to rise and repeat it, but if he wants to interject perhaps he will rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister was saying that I should not rise. I am prepared to rise just as I am prepared to listen to the Minister. My right hon. Friend made an argument that the Minister accepted as one that he had not thought of before and he made clear that it was a serious argument. My right hon. Friend believes that there is another aspect to the argument, and as it appears that he has established one point the Minister might do him the courtesy of believing that he may have another point and listen without making glib remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will contain himself. He does not appear to have understood the point that has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I make a suggestion? I think that all members of the Committee participating in the debate might get along quicker if they allowed their passions gently to cool and simply
	<span class='label label-info column'>1306</span>
devoted themselves to the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very well, Mr. English, I apologise if I reacted in that way, but I had thought to give an assurance to the Committee and say that we accept the principle behind the amendment. However, I am at a difficulty if, every time I say that I accept the principle behind an amendment and that we shall look at the matter and seek to return to it on Report, the debate still continues. It is not sensible to give those sorts of assurance and seek to have a constructive debate in such circumstances, and that is a fair point for me to make. There seems to be no point in dragging on a debate after the time where it naturally comes to an end, but that is a matter for hon. Gentlemen to decide for themselves. I believe that I am entitled to my view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the amendment is unacceptable as drafted because it should not appear in clause 24, which deals with the duty of operators to inform traffic commissioners of relevant convictions, and that the correct place would be in clause 20, which deals with the grant of operators' licences. If the hon. Gentleman looks to clause 20, he will see in subjections (1) and (4) the sort of provisions I have been talking about. That is one reason why the amendment is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second reason why it is unacceptable. Once traffic commissioners have been informed of a conviction they may be satisfied that a licence should, nevertheless, be granted. That is to say, even if they have been informed of the relevant conviction they may, nevertheless, believe that a licence should be granted regardless of whether an appeal is pending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Opposition have a point. I apologise if my temper became short, but I repeat the assurance that we will look at the matter before Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I had not fully grasped the second point. I hope that, on that basis, my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central will accept that assurance. I would not wish to prevent the commissioner going ahead with an operators' licence in the circumstances he described and in spite of a conviction. I hope that the Minister will either table a Government amendment or allow the Opposition to table an amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I comment on the Minister's remarks about the way we are dealing with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0711">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1307</span>
these matters? We are not trying to get a trade-off of undertakings from the Minister against time to do our job properly. We are trying to reach agreement in the difficult circumstances of the Committee. However, I hope that the Minister will accept that in reaching an agreement in principle we are doing nothing wrong or improper. We think it is a proper way to proceed. I hope that it takes us nearer to agreement and results in a better Bill coming out of Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I ask leave to withdraw the amendment, may I say that I am sorry that the Minister has taken such a view. When I sat down and looked again at the amendment and at the clause I thought I had discovered a point that would be worth discussing. I appreciate what the Minister said. It was a genuine reflection; I was seeking to save time. I accept that the Minister will look at the matter again. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 226, in page 23, line 20, leave out "28" and insert "7".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to discuss amendment No. 208, in page 23, line 23, leave out "28" and insert "14".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 226 seeks to reduce the period of time within which the holder of a PSV operators' licence has to notify the traffic commissioners in writing of any relevant conviction of any employee or agent of his which has come to his knowledge, other than in the case of a relevant conviction of the licence holder or the transport manager of his road passenger transport business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, in this age of a very efficient postal service, 28 days is far too long a period to allow to elapse before the PSV operator has to notify the traffic commissioners of relevant convictions. Even by second-class mail seven days is quite sufficient. The postal service in this country is most efficient. It is often blamed for delays which are not due to the Post Office but to the sender. It is easy to blame the Post Office when one has forgotten to post something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is immaterial whether the time limit is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1308</span>
set at 28 days, 14 days or seven days. Some operators would still be late notifying the traffic commissioners and seek to put the blame on the Post Office or someone else. Even in the remote areas and islands of Scotland there is an efficient postal service and there is no valid reason for not reducing the period allowed from 28 days to seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, if a public service vehicle operator discovers that an employee or agent has had a relevant conviction recorded against him, he would take steps at once to notify the traffic commissioners. That is a duty to which any responsible operator would give priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If any members of this Committee were public service vehicle licence holders and found themselves having to notify the traffic commissioners of a conviction, I think that they would do so immediately. There is no valid reason why they should not. If anyone sought to postpone notifying the traffic commissioners it could surely be only for dubious reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By keeping the time at 28 days, there is a real danger that an operator may adopt the attitude that the matter is not important and therefore he can postpone notifying the commissioners until another day. This may apply particularly if the operator has had a busy day and night—like the members of this Committee. He might forget about notifying the traffic commissioners. If he had only seven days, he would be more likely to notify them in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 208 seeks to reduce the time from 28 days to 14 days. The same arguments apply to this amendment as apply to amendment No. 226. It is essential that the traffic commissioners receive as soon as possible any necessary information in order to decide whether to take disciplinary action against the licence-holder. If a transport manager needs to be replaced, there is a safeguard for the public service vehcile operator in that clause 22(2) states that the traffic commissioners may allow a period for a qualified replacement transport manager to be found. Therefore no unfair penalty will be incurred by a public service vehicle operator who notifies the traffic commissioners within 14 days instead of 28 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that public services vehicle operators would welcome a reduction in the time allowed because they would then ascertain the decision—if one were needed—of the traffic commissioners that much sooner. If I were in such a situation, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1309</span>
should wish to know as soon as possible any decision which could have an effect on the operation of my business. Too long a period would impose unnecessary additional stress and prolong the agony.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In certain circumstances, especially those which are likely to result in the revocation of the public service vehicle operator's licence, surely it is in the public's interests if the traffic commissioners are notified as soon as possible so that replacement operators may be found to continue the service with a minimum of inconvenience to the travelling public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister consider reducing the period allowed for operators notifying the traffic commissioners of relevant convictions from 28 days to seven days in subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) and from 28 to 14 days in subsection (3)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend— will the right hon. Gentleman—I have made this mistake twice, I am extremely sorry and will try not to do so again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I extrapolate the situation? Let us assume that the seven days were mandatory and that the conviction was not known until the second day. Let us assume that the post, like many posts in times of difficulty in this country, is three or four days late in arriving. Only then can the case be opened and adjudicated upon. May we take another extrapolation of the argument? When there is a threat to the nation's mail and all the post offices are closed and letters take a month to be delivered, is a man to be disbarred under the clause because it is drawn too finely?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notification to the traffic commissioner has to be in writing. It does not have to be sent via the postal service if no such service is available. It could be delivered by hand or by some other means, as long as it is in writing. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) said that the conviction might come to light on the second day. Does not the period run from the time that the PSV operator becomes aware of the conviction?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment and we should be willing to see what response the Minister makes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1310</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall) made the essential point that this is a probing amendment. We are attempting to discover what the Minister's thoughts are on the matter. We consider that 28 days is rather a long time in this case. Serious convictions that affect the competence of the manager may affect the conditions for issuing the licence. The argument, that a postal strike might put an operator in breach of the requirement is answered by subsection (4) which allows for acceptance of a reasonable excuse for failure to comply. I think that a postal strike would be considered a reasonable excuse. The Minister is right to have that fall-back position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with changing the period of 28 days, stated in both clauses for different types of convictions. We have sought to vary it in our amendment to 14 days in one case and 7 days in another. We think, for a good reason, that there is a distinction between the types of offences involved in these two areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to relevant convictions which involve the requirement to give notice in writing to the traffic commissioner. The Minister indicated what he considered would be relevant convictions. If a conviction is made, the clause requires 28 days' notice to be given to the operator for notification of the commissioner, that is a period of up to but no more than 28 days. We feel that the time should run from the date of conviction, although it was suggested that it should be from the time he became aware—in the case of a licensed operator—if his transport manager told him some time later than 28 days and he would still be able to claim that it was from the period when it came to his notice. Therefore, in that sense the 28 days applies from that specific period. Again, this is a reasonable requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if there are no such complications, it should be a straight conviction from day one, known to both the holder of the operators' licence and the transport manager, and a requirement made as laid down in the clause to inform the traffic commissioner. Twenty-eight days seems to be an extraordinary amount of time. A traffic commissioner is reasonably based and is not far away—not that I am suggesting that is is quicker from Hull to London than from Hull to Leeds. Nevertheless, communication between agents and transport operators tends to be easy,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1311</span>
so 28 days seems a long time, and for a good reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
2.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any matter of relevant conviction which the Minister considers serious enough to constitute a possibility that could lead to either the revoking or suspending of the licence or the varying of those conditions of licence, is a serious sanction. In such circumstances we do not feel it wise that, if those offences cause to be called into question the man's good reputation, which is one of the conditions for the transport manager, he should be allowed to continue to operate. That is, of course, if the offence was serious enough to warrant an absolute sanction such as withdrawal of the licence. In such circumstances, he should not continue to be able to operate for 28 days from the day of conviction. That is almost a month. It seems a long time when the whole area of control hangs on granting of operators' licences to persons of good repute, professional competence and financial standing. That is the key to control in this matter. If any of the conditions have been breached by a conviction, 28 days seems a long time. That refers specifically to a relevant conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment addresses itself to the second category in subsection (3), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the holder of a PSV operator's licence within 28 days of the occurrence of (	<i>a</i>) the bankruptcy or liquidation of the holder, or the sequestration of his estate or the appointment of a receiver, manager or trustee of his road passenger transport business;".</p></blockquote>
That seems a pretty drastic situation if the company has gone bankrupt. If the company cannot, for whatever reason, carry out its business operations—not necessarily because it may not be operating a reasonable business at that time; there may be many reasons why a company goes bankrupt—the emergency of such a situation is reasonably sudden and, on reflection, one could say that the receiver could continue the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the question we consider relevant is this: why is it again necessary to allow 28 days before it is announced that the company is bankrupt or in liquidation or its estates are being sequestered? We think 28 days is a long time. Therefore, we appeal to the Minister to give consideration, again on reflection-—and I am not seeking in any way to buy time, as was suggested earlier—
	<span class='label label-info column'>1312</span>
not to 7 days or 14 days as our amendments suggest but to a shorter period than 28 days. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister says to justify the 28-day period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to be rather brief. I support the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Mr. Marshall), certainly as a probing measure, because, while I am not obsessed with the idea of the 14-day or 7-day period that he suggested, 28 days seems a long period. It is normally known as a month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded that when we discussed clause 22 concerning the power or ability of traffic commissioners to suspend the revocation of a licence because the transport manager had ceased to work for an organisation, my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and I proposed a six-month limit to that. In reply, the Minister said that he felt a six-month limit was rather excessive and that he would expect the transport manager to be replaced well inside six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems strange, therefore, that even had our amendment been carried, under those regulations we could have been talking about a period of seven months. For what might be described as a more important offence under subsection (2), it could have been a 28-day period. One would have expected that the company would both have wanted and been able to inform the traffic commissioners immediately. As I understand the matter, that would result in someone's immediate disqualification from carrying on that aspect of his business. If it merits that sort of immediate action from the commissioners, it also seems to merit immediate notification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not direct my remarks at the first of the two amendments, but at amendment No. 208. As that would amend subsection (3), I want to draw attention to the fact that the subsection is in two parts. I am particularly concerned about the period of 28 days as applied to paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of subsection (3). As the subsection reads, it appears that the holder of a PSV operator's licence would have 28 days to inform the traffic commissioners of a change in the identity of a transport manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from our previous discussion that the transport manager's competence is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1313</span>
a most important fact, and one to which traffic commissioners are supposed to pay great attention. I cannot understand the logic of a period of 28 days to notify the change in a transport manager's identity. I can understand that if an event takes place that is totally unforessen, it is reasonable to give a certain period for the holder of the PSV operator's licence to notify the traffic commissioner. But I cannot see that a change in the identity of a transport manager will be an unforeseen occurrence. There could be practical difficulty in any case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A crsis of identity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not thinking of a crisis of identity but of a more practical problem. If a transport manager leaves his job he will hand in his notice. I am not sure of the usual period of notice for a transport manager. I suspect it may be a month, although it might be three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The holder of the PSV operator's licence must then find a new transport manager. It may be a promotion from within the organisation, but it is quite likely to be an appointment from outside that will involve advertising, allowing a period for receipt of application, interviewing and appointing a new transport manager.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the end of the story. In the real world, transport managers are not readily available and queueing up for appointments. The new transport manager will probably have to give notice to his present employer and there will be a gap. That is a practical difficulty in the way it is drafted to which I shall return in a moment. Once the identity of the new transport manager has been established, I cannot see that it should take a month to inform the traffic commissioners. I should have thought that a much shorter period of a week, or two weeks at the outside, would be necessary, because all sorts of other people have to be notified about an appointment. I would not expect the holder of a PSV operator's licence to take a month to notify all the other people who need to be told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What disturbs me also is that the clause as drafted and subsection (2), which is covered by amendment No. 226, leave me with the feeling that in drafting the clause the Minister—or the draftsmen—have taken 28 days as a standard period, without giving any thought to the appropriate period for a particular set of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1314</span>
The appropriate period in one set of circumstances is not necessarily the appropriate period in another set. It is obvious that the Minister is putting 28 days forward for everything. A little more attention should be paid to the individual circumstances covered by subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) and subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), and there should not be simply a standard period for notification to the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make these points briefly, but because they are serious points I should like to hear the Minister's answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point that I should make is that there is no intention to make these random selections of 28 days without any thought or precedent. The precedent to which I would point is that in the Public Service Vehicles Operators (Qualifications) Regulations 1977, and in a moment I might come to that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of amendment No. 226 is to advise the period within which a licence holder must notify the traffic commissioner in writing of the relevant conviction of an employee or agent. The Bill as drafted provides that such a conviction must be reported within 28 days of its coming to the licence holder's notice; the amendment would reduce the period to seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A relevant conviction of the holder of the licence or his transport manager must, however, be notified within 28 days. If the hon. Gentleman looks at clause 24(2)(	<i>a</i>), he will see that the provision for a transport manager has been left at 28 days, although the amendment would change the figure from 28 to 7 days in paragraph (	<i>b</i>).

To specify a shorter time limit for reporting the conviction of an employee or agent, which is presumably a lesser slur on the holder's good repute, holds itself up to being challenged on the ground of illogicality, even though the time limit begins when the conviction comes to the holder's notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of judgment and decision for the Committee, but I see no purpose in reducing the time limit for reporting employees' or agents' convictions from 28 to 7 days. In my view, seven days is a very tight time limit for notice in writing, especially when it applies to less serious traffic offences. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) made a fair point in that respect. It may also take time to check the details with the employee, or even perhaps with the court, and the licence holder may

know of a conviction but not precisely what it is. For all those reasons, the Committee would be well advised to stick to 28 days rather than reduce it to seven days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 208 would reduce from 28 to 14 days the period within which the holder of a PSV operator's licence would have to notify to the traffic commissioners a case of bankruptcy or liquidation or any change of transport manager. Again, it seems to me that the existing time limit is quite reasonable. To impose one of 14 days would place an unnecessary burden on individuals or companies already hard pressed by definition, particularly in view of the penalty for non-compliance in subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 28-day period was taken directly from the 1977 qualification regulations, and the Bill makes in this respect no change of substance. Twenty-eight days is in the present law. It does not seem to me to be over-generous, and I can see no reason for a reduction in it.

I also agree with the Minister that it is a matter of judgment. However, I do not agree with his judgment. I sought for a better response from him than he has given. If it had been forthcoming, I would have been prepared to seek to withdraw the amendment, but as we seem to differ on our judgments I wish to press the matter to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
