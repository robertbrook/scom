	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the arch-disintegrater is not here. I should have thought that the Minister would be here to deal with the integration arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is only a small clause but a fundamental point is involved which will divide the Committee in a fundamental way. In many ways it reflects the theological difference in attitude between the two major parties and the difference in the attitudes to transport, particularly public transport and freight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1968 Act was fundamentally a new deal for British Rail and it certainly represented a different approach. Other legislation since the war has reflected different attitudes towards integrated transport, but basically it has always claimed to attempt to achieve a better transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with one part of the mechanism, as envisaged by the Labour Party, to achieve integration. The clause, in dealing with the abolition of the special authorisation procedures for long distance road transport, also seeks to abolish the Freight Integration Council—and in view of what has happened over the past few years one could say that that is what it has almost done for itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, it has always been the express purpose of legislation—the 1968 Act was designed specifically for this purpose—to give a new deal to British Rail and to adopt a new approach to transport problems. The essential principle and express purpose was to end the rivalry between road and rail, to attempt to complement the advantages of these two systems and to integrate them in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2140</span>
inter-modal concept as embodied in the National Freight Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The desire was to bring together the advantages of both road and rail transportation and develop them together. The Freight Integration Council had the express purpose of working at the two systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In abolishing the Freight Integration Council we are, in fact, announcing its official death, the council having died many years ago. But the other part of the clause dealing with the repeal of quantity licensing, cannot be said to have started— in fact it is being killed before being implemented. There is, in a sense, an abortion as it has not been given the chance to see whether it could be effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two aspects of an essential mechanism were seen by the Labour Government in 1968 as a means by which we could attempt to integrate two essential parts of our transport system—namely, the road and rail industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should address ourselves to a number of valid criticisms that were made by the Minister on Second Reading and during the Committee. To get to the heart of that opposition, I shall quote from his publication "The Right Track", which puts the argument against Labour Party policy. Indeed, part of it seeks to educate the Labour Party on transport. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Labour's objective is 'to move as much traffic as possible from road to rail and to water.'"</p></blockquote>
That is quoted directly from our manifesto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document continues by quoting from what we said in our consultation document of 1976:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But what of the popular belief that a dramatic environmental gain would accrue if only we shifted a large amount of long distance freight traffic from road to rail? Alas it is a pipedream."</p></blockquote>
The phraseology of the then right hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Tony Crosland) is well evident from that statement. It goes on to quote the Labour Government's White Paper, which was even more stringent in its attitude:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A substantial diversion of freight traffic from road to rail is not therefore immediately possible. Nor is it a sensible long-term aim. It could only be achieved by a detailed direction of traffic to the railways. But requiring industry to get approval before moving its goods would hinder its efficiency and mean extra cost to consumers. It would be an unwelcome extension of officialdom."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2141</span>
I am sure that on the Conservative Benches a great deal of agreement will be felt with those sentiments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are bound to address ourselves to the Minister's argument that if quantity licensing and the Freight Integration Council were not used as intended in 1968 they should be taken out of the Bill. It seems to be the basis of the reasoning that because they have not been used we should unclutter the legislation by taking them out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An argument that constantly goes on in the Labour Party is that an objective in the manifesto, such as that contained in clause 4, will not necessarily be implemented under a Labour Government. Integration is a little like that. A great deal is said about it at church on Sunday, so to speak, but there is not a great deal of movement towards its implementation. Nevertheless, integration is an important matter and is part of the Labour Party's fundamental thinking. We believe that it is becoming increasingly relevant to the problems of the transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not necessarily believe that all transport problems will be solved by quantity licensing, or that matters hang entirely on that. However, we feel that it is an important part of integration and a small part of the mechanism by which one attempts to inject community values and public interest into the criteria determining the distribution of transport and into all the other matters that the commercial market fails to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the arguments about community values and social cost should increasingly dominate the subject of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the war transport policy of all Governments has claimed a common objective—namely, a more effective use of our road and rail assets. There has been a dispute about the principles that we adopt to achieve that objective. The marketeers believe that the price mechanism will be the determining factor. Others believe that some form of intervention and control is needed in order to achieve a better balance of distribution and to take account of the community's concern in this vital area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour Party's approach has been dominated by the British Transport Commission. This was evident in the 1968 Act, when the National Freight Corporation was set up to bring together road and rail,
	<span class='label label-info column'>2142</span>
hiving off part of the rail aspect and seeking to integrate the best transportation systems into the National Freight Corporation. I believe that that was a good concept, and the past chairmen developed it very well. But eventually, for a number of reasons, it sold itself out completely to road transport interests and attitudes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the National Freight Corporation's evidence to the Armitage inquiry, there is no longer any pretension to a connection with rail. The NFC argues its case purely on a commercial lorry service basis even against the present Government's proposal to impose further taxes on heavy lorries. It has therefore made a complete move-over, no doubt ready for that part to be sold off to the private sector as desired by the Government and, it seems, to a large extent by the National Freight Corporation also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tory approach is one of denationalisation, but it is evident in the Bill, and indeed in other legislation, that denationalisation relates only to the profitable parts. It is a plundering of public assets and a decontrolling of the mechanisms by which one might introduce some kind of complementation between these aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That has been the difference between the two parties since the war. Neither has been completely successful in the implementation of its policies. I shall not at this stage develop the argument that one system has proved far better than the other. This morning, I hope to convince the Committee that the balance of advantage is moving more and more towards the community determining greater integration of the systems. I think that both parties would agree on that. Even the Conservatives, having originally lurched to the market mechanism in the 1950s, with the Beeching logic and the thousands of cuts in the railways, have moved away from that principle in the decision to retain and to support the rail system at its present level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time of the 1968 Act, transport was dominated by the road industry. That Act, parts of which are repealed by the Bill, resulted from the Labour Government's desire to give a new deal to the railways, to return to intervention and to complementing the systems, and to introduce new ideas as to how that could be achieved. It may be argued that it was a kind of planned competition, because, in the integration of road and rail, particularly by the National Freight Corporation, the objective of transferring traffic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2143</span>
from one system to the other was not a community objective initse If but could take place only if it were shown to be equally profitable, cheap, quick and efficient. That meant that the argument was always loaded against the rail industry, and was one of the reasons why the NFC was obliged more and more to seek solutions in developing the road sector, as can be seen from the NFC's record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be put on record that, when that policy was developed, in putting the legislation before Parliament, the then Minister of Transport, Barbara Castle, stated clearly that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Integration is a practical response to the needs of today and if those needs are to be met we must do some hard thinking about just were we want integration and why, and then decide the how."</p></blockquote>
She decided in favour of the National Freight Corporation as the way to introduce that policy, and stated that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the National Freight Corporation … will be responsible for all freight traffic in the public sector which originates by road, while leaving to British Railways responsibility for traffic originating by rail—whether as complete trains or as wagon load traffic."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 December 1967; Vol. 756, c. 1283 and 1285.]</p></blockquote>
But there was in that the principle of competition, equal efficiency and equal cost. As I have suggested, that worked to the disadvantage of the rail sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Barbara Castle introduced quantity licensing, she did so with a certain qualification. She said that she would not introduce quantity licensing that required authorisation for traffic over 100 miles. At that time she considered the breakeven point between the advantages of rail and road. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have no intention of introducing quantity licensing until the freightliners are capable not only of producing a comprehensive service, but a reliable one."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 20 December 1967; Vol. 756, c. 1287.]</p></blockquote>
Despite all its difficulties, no one could doubt that Freightliners developed effectively. One could argue that it could handle much more traffic than it does today. That is an argument worth deploying. The success of Freightliners is such that today it carries 8 million tonnes and has 42 per cent. of deep sea traffic. It has one of the largest concentrations of freight and container traffic on rail anywhere in Europe. It compares favourably with organisations in many parts of the world.
	<span class='label label-info column'>2144</span>
Despite its difficulties, Freightliners has been quite a success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already quoted from "The Right Track", which influenced opinion at the time of the 1978 Act. At that time there was a desire to aim for more harmonised competition. Note that there are always qualifications attached to competition. We are never told of the bald fact of competition, the bald determination of everything on the grounds of price alone. There is always to be a conditioned harmonisation—harmonised competition, or regulated competition. There is never to be limply competition as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1978 Act developed the concept of fair track costs, which would entail lorries beginning to pay more. The idea was that we should begin to civilise the lorry and make it carry its proper costs. That idea was developed primarily for environmental reasons, because of the damage to the community. One sees the beginning of the introduction of a criterion other than that of cost, the introduction of the concept of consideration for the community and for the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the idea behind the section 8 grants, for example. Those have been quite successful. The intention behind them was to utilise rail assets more effectively, thus encouraging more trade to transfer to the rail system. But the successor to the 1978 Act continues the old Tory philosophy of denationalising profitable sectors and leaving the Government to act as a kind of ambulance to the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will have to give money to the unprofitable sectors just to keep them ticking over. They will be reduced to having to compete. Whatever is left of the railway system, one is always told that the best way forward is that it should be forced to compete. A competitive atmosphere is enforced although the balance of advantage has always been in favour of the road haulage industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our arguments against the deletion under the clause of certain parts of the 1968 Act do not maintain that those parts have not been used effectively to date. We argue that they are still relevant. Indeed, they are becoming more relevant in view of the problems that will develop over the next 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at some of the problems that are beginning to predominate in our transport system. We note that demand
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2145</span>
for transport must grow. It has grown and it will continue to grow. For many years transport has been a growth sector, in terms both of ton-mileage and of units.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman believes that the Freight Integration Council is so relevant, why during six long years of Labour Government did they do nothing about actually using it? It appears to have become totally moribund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. I tried to indicate that that argument must be faced. But if the hon. Gentleman will stick with me, there is a number of arguments that justify our belief. However, we do not believe that it will necessarily be relevant to keep the Freight Integration Council. It has not proved an effective body. I shall make that clear in a minute. One of the Select Committees on which I sat advocated that it be abolished. However, there was a most important condition attached to its abolition. I shall return to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I wish to make the point that the demand for transport is increasing. It is becoming greater in terms both of ton-milage and of units on our roads. Lorries are growing bigger and covering greater distances on average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful for the evidence given by the Department and other bodies to Armitage. We now have much relevant detail, which has been produced over the last month or so, on which to make a judgment about these matters. We are fortunate in being able to debate in Committee the argument on integration, which cannot easily be raised on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The demand for transport continues to grow. Bigger lorries are going further into urban areas and that is leading to demands for forms of control. The road share of traffic in this country is increasing. It is now 83 per cent. British Rail takes the majority of the remainder, but it has the capacity to carry more. I think that we should nail the myth that, even if more traffic were transferred to British Rail, it could not carry it. British Rail's evidence to Armitage in the last few months enables us to look at the facts. It is clear that, even if there is no more investment in freight by British Rail, 5 per cent. or 10 per cent. more traffic could be taken
	<span class='label label-info column'>2146</span>
now. That is probably £8 million to £16 million. Without a great deal more investment, it could take up to 50 per cent. more, and carry 250 million tonnes. Even with its present difficulties, British Rail has the capacity to take more traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody envisages a massive transfer of traffic from road to rail. That has never been our argument. We have said that it is in the community's interest that certain traffic should go by rail. That would assist the railway industry and use an under-used asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The road haulage industry is creating more congestion on our roads. Heavier lorries are creating enviromental problems. Everyone in the Committee is aware of all those problems, so I do not need to itemise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we believe that rail could carry more, given that roads are becoming increasingly congested and demanding more investment which the Government say they cannot make, clearly the question is how to encourage traffic to go from road to rail transport. What is the criterion of allocation? The market mechanism will not do it, because transport is cheaper by road. Both sides of the Committee have accepted that. The Government's encouragement of the transfer of traffic from road to rail by fiscal measures is an indication of that. That was well stated by the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) who, as Minister of Transport in 1972–73, said that he would keep the rail system at that level and give a lot of money to develop it, which he did. I think the allocation was £900 million over several years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have agreed that the existing rail system shall remain. The Minister has made clear that he is not prepared to cut it, as I found to my cost at an earlier stage in the argument. There is unused capacity on rail. Roads are becoming increasingly congested. Therefore, it is in the community's interest, apart from that of British Rail, to put more traffic on to British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we all agree on that, how can it be done? The mechanism that has been developed so far is to encourage British Rail to take bulk trainload capacity. Most of that market has been saturated, and to that extent British Rail has done a very good job. There is still room to take more of that traffic, but a major contribution has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that the market mechanism
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2147</span>
cannot be the single criterion. I draw support from the words of the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler) on 23 January 1976 when he had been a Shadow transport spokesman for only seven days:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not suggest that the economic criterion is the only one in transport. Plainly, there are other aspects of transport policy— for instance, the protection of the public, the protection of the environment, and the inescapable need for some public services."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 23 January 1976; Vol. 903, c. 1752.]</p></blockquote>
I could probably add safety. I am sure that the Minister would, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister therefore accepts, and his policy shows, that there are other criteria than the market mechanism. Hence, the thinking of Armitage. So it is not only competition that will determine what will relocate traffic between the two competing systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It can be done in two ways. The first is by licensing and by some form of direction, which has been more evident on the continent than in this country. In fact, in the successful French and German economies, of which we hear so much, licensing and price controls have been used effectively as a means of regulating the transport industry. The Foster Committee report considered some of those examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second method is to give encouragement. The section 8 sidings provision in the 1978 Act was one way of doing that. That is one of the answers to the question about integration that was raised by the hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) who asked why a Labour Government did not implement freight integration and quantity licensing. The Labour Government were convinced that the best way of getting nationalised industries to compete with each other was for the market mechanism to introduce the right type of financial discipline. I did not accept it, but that was the Labour Government's view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, they went further. They said that they would and give positive financial inducement to attract traffic from road to rail. A study of the section 8 sidings grant provisions shows clearly that 78 sidings projects were agreed at a cost of £21 million to carry 16 million tonnes of traffic. So far only 9 million tonnes have been implemented, but the Government have agreed on traffic amounting to 16 million tonnes. That is a considerable amount. Environmental considerations were
	<span class='label label-info column'>2148</span>
the reason for that. Apparently lorries left one colliery at the rate of one every one-and-a-half minutes, which deserves thinking about when considering putting freight on to rail. It is beyond my comprehension that we have to pay money to nationalised industries to do that, but it is part of the logic of financial incentives being available to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Government refused this financial help for certain authorities if they thought that the advantages were insufficient, it became a kind of fiscal, not direct, licensing. One had to apply and meet certain criteria, and the Government then gave a licence by giving money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made it clear that he intends to legislate by 1983 to ensure that lorries carry their fair share of track costs. It was made clear to Armitage that the bigger lorries especially were not carrying their fair share of track costs to the tune of approximately £200 to £500 per lorry. That is a lot of money. The Minister has stated that he will legislate to increase taxation in that respect, so road transport will begin to carry that extra cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is done, the allocation of traffic will be affected. The break-even cost band, which in the 1960s was considered to be 100 miles, is now 250 miles or more. The introduction of the 30-ton lorry made it cheaper to carry larger units. If a 40-ton lorry were introduced, clearly the same economics would occur. The cost to the operator would not mean cost to the community, even if the Minister intends to place fair track costs on to lorries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Foster or Armitage concluded that, if one took account of fair track costs, 3 per cent. or 4 per cent. would be added to the operating cost of a lorry. If one takes also account of proper damage costs, that will add another 3 per cent. or 4 per cent. Therefore, that will increase the operating costs of these lorries by 8 per cent. or 10 per cent. The break-even price between rail and road will then change substantially. An 8 per cent. increase in road costs will mean a greater proportional advantage to rail, because most of the traffic is concentrated in this break-even band of about 200 miles. Therefore, there would be a positive inducement to British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2149</span>
market mechanism, with his inducement, rail would get more traffic and the aim of all of us would be achieved, because he would be integrating the two systems without quantity licensing and without the Freight Integration Council, which he might say we do not need. That is fair argument. But I argue that we must take account of another point which the community cannot ignore. There must be some authority by which the criteria between the two systems are determined. It could be the Armitage Committee which could do exactly what the Freight Integration Council should have done. The council had the power but did not use it, thereby abdicating completely its responsibility in this respect. Its purpose was to advise the Minister because of its many independent experts and its continuity, but it failed rather tragically to do that. It was not because of some fault in the concept or design but because of the quality of some of those who took part, together with certain political ideas about what it should have been doing. That was one of the many problems.

The right hon. Gentleman made clear in 1976 that he believed that it should not be a bureaucratic body. He said that the consumer should make the decision. The consumer all too often operates what he thinks is cheapest and best for him. That is one of the apparent benefits of the system. But we must recognise that a transport system, by definition, is not static. A demand for lorries is growing and if we bring in 40-tonners with four, five and six axles, there will be yet greater demand for them among those who need commercial transportation by lorry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will certainly be cheaper for operators to use. There was evidence of that when the 32-tonners took the place of 16-tonners. But price should not be the only criteria. The terms of reference of the Armitage inquiry were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To consider the causes and consequences of the growth in the movement of freight by road and, in particular, of the impact of the lorry on people and their environment; and to report on how best to ensure that future development serves the public interest."</p></blockquote>
Those are wide and comprehensive terms of reference, which cover the whole transport system. Evidence was given to the committee from many sources. No one was asked to consider the consequences of bringing a 40-tonne lorry into Britain in
	<span class='label label-info column'>2150</span>
the context of the EEC. The remit was broader than that. We should now be looking at the broader consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar terms of reference should have been given to the Freight Integration Council. I understand why the Minister did not do that, but that is not necessarily a reason for considering that the NFC is defunct in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of reference spoke of the public interest. The public interest is to be defined on broader terms than the cheapest form of transport available to the consumer at the lowest cost. There is increasing concern about the juggernaut and its effect on the environment, on safety, bearing in mind the contravention of overloading laws which the Minister knows takes place throughout the EEC and, to a certain extent, in the United Kingdom. There is conflict between the community's interests and the interests of commerce. That is why measures are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first response was to make the lorry safer. The second was to have lorry routes. What happened to those? The Labour Government's 1978 Bill proposed special tracks for them, and said that if freight could not be put on ribbons of steel it should be put on ribbons of concrete and that a whole new transport system should be developed. The Government considered what it would mean to restrict 16-ton-plus lorries on our roads and they found that to divert them would increase mileage by 20 per cent. and increase the cost, according to the evidence given to Armitage, of £130 million. They felt that that was too expensive. With the cost of tachographs starting at £300 million, the cost of lorry routes seems to pale into insignificance in the context of transport costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government say that that is too expensive, and that they will not do anything, they will abandon that area, perhaps to go to the bypass argument. But that argument costs money and of the 500 towns where we wanted bypasses we have only 130 with bypasses and no-nobody seems prepared to find more money for more bypasses or more roads. So we dump the argument and leave it to local authorities. The GLC found that if it wanted to restrict lorries it would cost industry £150 million. Apparently it costs £500,000 and 130,000 gallons more of fuel to bypass Windsor. York is now in the process of trying to protect itself
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2151</span>
because the Government abdicate their responsibility to create lorry routes or direct more of this harmful traffic to another means in the under-used transport system. Therefore, the evidence is growing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that has changed substantially and rapidly since 1968 is the difference in energy costs. Looking at the evidence given to Armitage, one sees that a 10-tonne lorry has labour costs of 45 per cent. and fuel costs of 8 per cent., but a 32-tonne lorry had labour costs of 30 per cent.—a reduction which was better for the operator—while fuel costs rose to 20 per cent. of the operation. The operator could still say that he could afford that and was getting the price he wanted and making a profit. But the argument is no longer just about the price of fuel but more about the availability of fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that anybody who wants to examine the argument about energy should read the booklet recently issued by British Petroleum, "Crisis Toady"—no doubt distributed by Saatchi and Saatchi. The booklet says that if it is desired to maintain the amount of growth in oil supplies at the rate over the last 50 years of 5½ per cent., it will be necessary to find two Alaska oilfields every year. Whatever the argument about atomic energy may be, there is just no way in which that can be done. Certainly, for the next two decades there is no doubt that we shall have to depend upon the internal combustion engine, and a dire situation for energy resources will exist in that period. Therefore, energy conservation is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The booklet says that the choice for the community in the rest of the century is either reducing growth because of the lack of oil availability or having more growth with less dependence on oil—that is, by a better utilisation of oil. Road transport is at least three times more wasteful of energy than rail for the carriage of one ton of freight. Rail transport in this country takes only 1 per cent. of our oil resources whereas 50 per cent. goes largely to road transport. Clearly that is a major consideration to be taken into account for the reallocation of traffic. Apart from matters such as costs, damage to roads and the environment, how we conserve our most vital resources of energy must be taken into account. Efficiency has usually meant the cheapest way of achieving an objective and we question why that is no longer the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2152</span>
case. The Foster report on road haulage operators' licensing referred to efficiency as the ability of the industry to provide the range of services for which the user is willing to pay at minimum resource cost to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the lecture entitled "The Day After Tomorrow", given by Sir Peter Parker in February 1979—that also looked into the argument about efficiency which dominated the Labour Government's 1978 thinking on the transport system—it is stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we are seeking in industry to reconcile the drive for efficiency in business and the equal and sometimes opposite drive for improving the quality of life."</p></blockquote>
Such arguments create considerable difficulties in the concept that market price should be the determining factor. We are all interventionists of one sort or another, whether fiscal or direct. We intervene to prevent the full consequences of a market system determining transport policy. Tony Crosland was convinced that matters should be left more to the market because apparently he did not like bureaucratic bodies and civil servants, and so on, making the decisions. I believe that he underestimated the consequences of an energy crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a matter of judgment. We believe that the best way of proceeding is to introduce community values and not leave it to the market mechanism. We should intervene increasingly to protect the community from the consequences of that. Our transport systems must be used much effectively than they are at present. It seems logical to meet an increased demand for transport with another system that is underutilised. That is the best use of resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that the proposal would be acceptable to the Government in the context of money supply and public expenditure. Presumably the justification for Armitage is to examine other criteria and to make a decision on those, not simply to leave the consumer to choose a 40-ton lorry because it is cheaper to operate. Indeed, Armitage is challenging the idea that the market mechanism should foist such lorries on us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether one believes in a bureaucracy such as the British Transport Commission, a national transport authority, or even a national transport council, which NFC has been talking about on its death bed, various bodies could be considered. The freight integration was conceived of to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2153</span>
deal with such matters and to bring continuity, but that did not happen. That is a reflection on those who participated and on the politicians who gave its direction. I should like to read out a recommendation from the Select Committee report on the National Freight Corporation. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a suitable opportunity should be taken to introduce legislation to abolish the Freight Integration Council which should be replaced by some more effective body."</p></blockquote>
The Minister is constantly speaking of what Committees of the House have told him, but he only ever takes from them what he chooses. That applied to pensions. We had a big debate about the matter. The Minister did not ask a Committee about an alternative system. He has now done exactly the same with another Select Committee. He has picked out the argument that the council should be abolished but has not gone further and set up another body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, he has set up the Armitage Committee and commissioned the Leitch report to deal with what the Freight Integration Council should have done. The concept was right but the application was lousy. That reflects on those who had no faith in it. They include a former Member of the House, Sir Richard Marsh, who was both the Minister and a member of the council. In both capacities he was somewhat disastrous, and that tradition continues with those bodies on which he currently sits, such as that concerned with newspapers. The slogan "Long live the centre" springs to mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for a body such as the Freight Integration Council. It is fair for the Minister to make clear that it did not prove itself, but that is not an argument for saying that there should not be anything in its place. We believe that the Select Committee's point should be taken and the clause rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments against massed quantity licensing have been powerful. Quite apart from the Minister making clear that he is not in favour of it, there is the point that it was never applied. If Barbara Castle had remained Minister of Transport and Freightliners had been developed, quantity licensing may well have been implemented. But for a number of reasons Ministers who followed her were not convinced about the matter. It would be fair to say that although we did not implement
	<span class='label label-info column'>2154</span>
quantity licensing we went onto another tack, with which I have already dealt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is later evidence from the Foster Committee, which came out against it. However, I understand that Professor Foster was one of the advisers on the 1968 Bill, which introduced quantity licensing. Now he advises that, on balance, it should not be brought back. However, there is evidence that it can be used effectively. One need only look to the EEC for that. Its rail systems carry a considerably higher proportion—two and three times as much —than ours. As Foster states, that may well be to do with geographical advantages and the longer distances that are travelled. However, the Community has shown that more can go by rail. It can complement the transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Foster says that the decision whether to have quantity licensing is political. He suggests that if it is brought in, environmental protection should be a factor in the issue of licences. He does not seem to be totally opposed to the idea, but implies that if it does come about it should be used to protect the environment. That was very much in the mind of Barbara Castle when she brought forward the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view insufficient account has been taken of energy factors which will change considerably. That should force us to use the available spare rail capacity that exists and to recognise that competitive forces will play a part, but that it should not be an essential one. We should also recognise the fact that the new traffic which will come about cannot be exclusively put on the railways. Clearly that cannot be so, but certain types of traffic should go to rail. There is a economic and environmental argument for active intervention in diverting traffic to the rail system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one believes, as people do on the Continent, that there should be a choice, some authority is needed—it may be the Government or an agency—to direct how freight is carried. Matters should not be left to the market mechanism. There should be a principle of special authorisation, which, incidentally, is still embodied in the legislation for special loads. I believe that about 2,800 of those go through London each year. Authorisation is needed from a bureaucratic body for them to go from A to B. The concept of special authorisation is not being com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2155</span>
pletely thrown out; it is being removed only in respect of the direction of traffic on journeys of more than 100 miles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the Minister does not accept our argument, as the matter has never been implemented surely it would do no great damage to require him to implement it later. The Armitage committee is to report on how to ensure that future developments serve the public interest. It may decide that it would be sound and logical for there to be some sort of licensing. If that were to happen—as is the case in the Community—I assume that there would have to be even more legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not leave matters as they are? Armitage may even recommend that. We shall vote against the clause primarily because there is no proposal to replace the Freight Integration Council with anything else and also because we believe that quantity licensing, which could serve vital transport integration and community needs, should not be deleted. It does not complicate matters and Armitage may recommend its retention. The Minister should not prejudge the Committee's findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have taken so long on the point. I have tried to develop the fundamental argument about integration. I may not have done that very convincingly, but it had to be done because certain difficulties will arise for the Opposition. We shall have quoted against us what the position should have been before and what it should be now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The duty of the Opposition is to look at the constantly changing scene in transport, determine its own priorities and ascertain whether the views held by previous Labour Governments are right and relevant to the present time. Our argument is that quantity licensing and the Freight Integration Council constitute an essential mechanism by which the community can exercise its own priorities in regard to transportation rather than leaving matters to the market mechanism system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak for only a fraction of the time that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) spoke for. I congratulate him on speaking for 50 minutes in defending what most of us would regard as the indefensible. I remind the hon. Gentleman that clause 54 abolishes the Freight Integration Council, yet for 50 minutes he defended what he
	<span class='label label-info column'>2156</span>
described as a more effective body than the Freight Integration Council. We have a choice between the Freight Integration Council as it was constituted in 1968 and its abolition. He could, therefore, have limited his remarks. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman did his best to justify a policy which I think most of his hon. Friends, and certainly the Government side, abandoned as unworkable years ago, but after which the Labour Party still seems to hanker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was struck by what the hon. Gentleman said about the difference between Labour Party theory and practice, and the comparison he drew with clause 4 of the Labour Party's constitution. He referred to Mrs. Barbara Castle who said, at the time of the 1968 Act, that integration was a practical response to the needs of the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that was a practical response, a greater demonstration of its total unworkability could not be given than the fact that its chief instrument—the Freight Integration Council—met on only seven occasions. It has not met for nine years, and despite the statutory requirement for it to produce an annual report, it produced only two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to part V of the 1968 Act, and the special authorisations. It was foreseeable that that part of the Act would never be brought into force. Indeed, at that time the Labour Party gave a commitment that it would not be brought into force unless certain requirements were met. Those requirements were never met, so it was never implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinary that an operator who wants to transport goods by road in a vehicle exceeding 16 tonnes gross weight on a journey of more than 100 miles should be required to apply for a special authorisation to do so. Despite what the hon. Gentleman said about the environmental and energy factors, all of which are important, I remind him that the Freight Integration Council could not consider those factors. It could consider only economic factors when determining whether it would provide special authorisation. I agree with him on the importance of the environmental, energy and safety factors. All are vital. Energy and environmental factors are becoming increasingly important, and safety is as important as it ever was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But those factors can be protected within a fair market provided, first, that road transport is required to meet the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2157</span>
same level of safety as for, say, rail. Certainly everything that my right hon. Friend has done indicates that the Government are just as determined as any other Government to look after the safety side of transport. In fact, he is continuing with the process, which previous Governments started, of reinforcing the need for safety in transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the environmental factors, my right hon. Friend said that lorries will be required to pay a fair share of track costs. That is necessary to ensure a fair market. A fair market can be used to protect the consumer as regards safety, the ordinary individual as regards environment, and the country in relation to its future energy needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kind of structure after which the hon. Member for Kingston-upon-Hull, East hankers would impose enormous cost upon the consumer and the community, and would help fuel inflation. I am therefore surprised that he has spent so much time defending a structure of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted to support clause 54 and I am very pleased that my right hon. Friend had decided by use of this instrument to abolish the Freight Integration Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The charge of theory and practice not coinciding can scarcely be levelled by a Conservative member against a Labour spokesman unless he totally disregards what the Minister is now doing. My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) quoted with approval the Minister's statement on the theory of integration and balance as between commercial and other considerations. I, too, approve of that statement. But to say, as the Government now do, that because the Freight Integration Council has not worked we should abandon the concept of freight integration is like saying that because the first attempt to fly did not work, man should not have gone ahead with developing aeroplanes. The first attempt at integration may have been a failure, but the reasons underlying that attempt are today even more valid. We must therefore strive to find an effective way to meet those considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that, in a number of respects, legislation addressed to this matter under the Labour Government was too timid and did not go far enough. My hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>2158</span>
the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East outlined very effectively the background against which the decisions were taken. But he did not make completely clear that sections 71 to 80 of the 1968 Act did not go as far as would have been necessary to take into account environmental and other matters that were considered relevant at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had that part of the Act been put into effect, almost all of the criteria for allowing refusal of a special authorisation would in fact be commercial criteria of the kind that would be approved by the market forces lobby. Had those provisions been brought into effect, it would have been necessary to demonstrate that the cost of using rail transport was equal or less, that the service provided was as fast, if not faster, and that equal or greater reliability could be guaranteed, and so on. They are precisely the kind of factors that those wishing to consign freight for transport would take into account if purely market mechanisms were applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if I have any criticism of the provisions to be abandoned if the clause is carried, it would be that they were too timid. They merely dipped a toe into the water instead of taking the plunge. I am not really surprised that they have not been used. Had they been more radical, had they addressed more fully the kind of consideration outlined by my hon. Friend as to effect on environment, fair track cost and, in particular, the efficient use of given transport resources, they might well have been brought into use by now and have been playing a very effective part in improving the transport system in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It therefore behoves the Minister this morning to spell out why he is deviating so far in practice from the principle that he outlined when he addressed his mind to the subject presumably for the first time. He must explain why he is prepared to leave to the market merchanism an area in which there is every authority for saying that a number of other considerations must be brought to bear. He is putting the whole area in peril and at risk by failing to tackle this difficult and complex problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not suggest that it is easy. But if the argument is that the instruments created up to now are not adequate for the purpose—and we accept that that is so—the answer is not to abandon them but to put in their place provisions that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2159</span>
will address the real problems that we face today and the real potential that exists for the improvement of transport services in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>The Minister of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a fascinating debate. I make no complaint about the length of the speech made by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). I found it a most interesting and useful contribution. He will forgive my saying that it dealt mainly with a restatement of Labour Party policy on freight movement, and marked a very radical departure. Indeed, if I understood the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) correctly, he also made the same point. The Labour Party has clearly re-examined its policy and has decided that the 1968 legislation was not only not good enough, but also not radical enough. Be that as it may—and we can certainly return to that—in the past 60 minutes, the statements and policies of Labour Ministers of Transport since 1974 have been ditched wholesale. The right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends are now embarking upon a new and radically different policy. As the hon. Gentleman said, we do not have time to debate this subject on the Floor of the House. I, for one, would very much welcome such a debate, as this would be a matter of great interest to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, clause 54 is in two parts. It provides for the abolition of the Freight Integration Council and for the repeal of provisions in the Transport Act 1968 for the establishment of a special authorisation procedure for long-distance road transport. The first part is admirably concise. I do not think that even the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) could criticise any lack of clarity in the meaning of the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Freight Integration Council established under section 6 of the Transport Act 1968 is hereby abolished."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that there is any room for doubt as to what we intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) has said, the Government have made a conscious effort to reduce the number of so-called quangos, which have shown such a tendency to proliferate. The Freight Integration Council represents a prime example. It was set up by Barbara Castle
	<span class='label label-info column'>2160</span>
under the Transport Act 1968 to deal with any problems arising between the numerous nationalised industries operating in the transport sector. The council could consider any matter relating to the provision and operation of an integrated freight service and refer its findings to the Minister for appropriate action if necessary
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Freight Integration Council was seen at that time as a key instrument of the Labour Government's philosophy of integration enshrined in the 1968 Act. In practice, however, it worked out very differently. Since its formation, the Freight Integration Council has met on seven occasions, the last of which was in June 1971. It published only two reports, the last of those in July 1973. The whole affair came to an end in 1975—not, I must point out, under a Conservative Government—when the appointments of the chairman and the appointed members expired and were not renewed. To be frank and blunt about it, the first part of the clause represents little more than a formal recognition of the accepted fact that the Freight Integration Council has long ceased to serve any useful function, if indeed it ever did so. The Freight Integration Council is dead and it should be buried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the second part of the clause. We have heard analogies about aircraft getting into the air and crashing. However, the special authorisation procedure was never alive at any stage. As the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) said, the second part of the clause repeals the provisions in part V of the 1968 Act, relating to special authorisations. No less than nine sections—sections 71 to 80 of the 1968 Act—provided for the establishment of a special authorisation procedure for long-distance freight transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea was that any operator wishing to use a vehicle whose weight exceeded 16 tonnes to transport goods by road further than 100 miles—in the case of some goods an even shorter distance was specified—would require special authorisation. The British Railways Board or the NFC could object to such authorisations being given on the ground that an equally satisfactory service could be provided by rail for all or part of the journey. Before the licensing authority could refuse a special authorisation, it would have to be demonstrated at a public inquiry that, taking all factors into account, the rail-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2161</span>
ways could provide a comparable service. Either side could then appeal to the transport tribunal against the decision made by the licensing authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East indicated that he would like to see the measure implemented. However, the mind boggles at the amount of bureaucracy, the hearings, the delays and the costs that such a procedure would entail. The special authorisation procedure has never been used. We estimate that if anyone were to attempt to implement it today, about 65,000 vehicles per week would require authorisation. To contemplate the prospect of dealing with the authorisation of 65,000 vehicles a week would be most extraordinary policy for any Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our argument was for the concept of quantity licensing. There were difficulties. It may well be that 65,000 lorries a week are involved in journeys of over 100 miles. We would say that the breakeven point has now gone beyond that distance. It may well be that the limit should now be 250 miles. Far fewer lorries would be involved then. However, I do not wish to argue about the details. But we accept the principle that there should be some form of direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to say that he does not wish to argue about the details. The details are crucial here. If there were to be direction of freight there would have to be a bureaucracy. An incredible number of such decisions would have to be made, regardless of whether the number of lorries involved was 65,000 or less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the point is at issue between us now, it was not a matter of dispute between the Conservative Party and the hon. Gentleman's predecessors that such a system would add to bureaucracy, to costs and thus to the final price paid by the consumer. Until a few moments ago, I had not considered that the clause took any particularly controversial step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we come to the general philosophy on the movement of freight throughout the country. The speech of the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East was basically concerned with the general philosophy. His contribution was interesting. One of the basic questions is: how are we to
	<span class='label label-info column'>2162</span>
achieve the shift sought by the hon. Gentleman? The Government would like to see a good share of this country's freight going by rail. That is the purpose of section 8 aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, everyone who has looked seriously at the question has come to the conclusion that direction of freight—that is what the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend are now advocating—will not be achieved. It is impractical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to dispute what I have said, I shall quote to him again what the late Anthony Crosland, who served as Secretary of State for the Environment, said:

	<br><blockquote><p>"A substantial diversion of freight traffic from road to rail is not therefore immediately possible. Nor is it a sensible long-term aim. It could only be achieved by detailed direction of traffic to the railways. But requiring industry to get approval before moving its goods would hinder its efficiency and mean extra cost to consumers. It would be an unwelcome extension of officialdom."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) will confirm that such was not always the case, but on this subject I find myself in total agreement with the formei Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —but the right hon. Gentleman is saying that the 1968 Act was not radical enough. Perhaps the public have not been listening to our Committee debates with quite the rapt attention that we might have liked. However, when this news begins to percolate out of the Committee they will want to know precisely what the Labour Party is now proposing. It is certainly proposing the direction of freight. There is no question about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke of an alternative body to the Freight Integration Council. The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) seemed to be saying that that was too timid an approach that it was not radical enough. However, the fact of the matter is that if we were to have direction of freight all the disadvantages pointed out by the right hon. Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers) would appear. Such a system would add to bureaucracy, to officialdom, and, above all, to costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view—which was until a short time ago common ground between the Parties—is that the basic choice in freight movement should be left to the customer and should not be the subject of direction. The hon. Gentleman is right in saying that it is basic that in making that free choice, the users, whether road or rail freight carriers, should pay their full track cost. I am committeed to that, and I have made that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also made it clear that vehicle excise duty for the heaviest lorries will be increased. We have also set up the Armitage inquiry to look at the lorry and the environment including all the issues about which the hon. Gentleman has spoken. I believe that this is an important inquiry and, as I have already said, it will guide the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to create fair competition in this country. The elements of free competition are free choice for the customer, the observance of safety standards and payment of full track costs by carriers. The carriers of freight must also meet other criteria, such as environmental criteria. That is why we set up the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2164</span>
Armitage inquiry in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East said that we are all interventionists now. I suppose that that must be true to some extent. However, there is a vast difference between the maximum intervention talked about by the hon. Gentleman, and the minimum intervention and safeguards that we are talking about. Our aim is to provide the best service for the public. We seek to put the interests of the customer first. That is what our whole transport policy is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has made a very significant statement, which was supported by his right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). It marks, probably, the most radical shift in Labour Party policy on freight that I have seen and heard while I have been doing my job in Opposition and in Government. That radical shift will lead to direction of freight in this country, and it will lead to extra costs to the consumer. In my view, it is totally against the interests of the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition want to think about policies and their relevance. We all accept that argument. We do not accept the Minister's stretching of the argument. We are not arguing that all traffic should be directed. There is not the capacity for that. Indeed, the 1968 Act was one of the most liberalising forces in licensing proposals ever to come out of Parliament. So we do not accept that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I said it is important, since the Minister keeps stressing the point—was that the rail capacity could take 5 per cent. more traffic, or even 10 per cent. That is about 16 million tonnes of traffic. The quantity licensing idea was for journeys over 100 miles. Things have moved on since 1968. I even considered 250 miles. We are talking about intervening in a fractional area. Instead of having 40 tonne juggernauts by the thousand touring our country, we are prepared to say that some of that traffic should go by rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister keeps advancing the extreme argument. We see it as a mechanism of intervention, control and direction in the name of the community that decides it is in its interest. It is not a wholesale direction of the traffic, and the Minister should be clear what we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2165</span>
have been saying. It is clear in the speeches. I do not want the Minister to believe that the argument is for a wholesale direction of traffic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are condemned because we are departing from "The Right Track" argument which apparently identified the Minister with members of the Labour Party in the past in the administration of transport. I am quite prepared to accept that, but it is not for me to justify that argument. I am here to argue my party's policy on transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened very carefully to the hon. Gentleman for 45 minutes. If his speech meant anything at all—which, to do him credit, I think that it did—it marked a very radical change from the policies pursued by the previous Labour Government in the period from 1974 to 1979. I think that he would agree on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The division is less narrow than might appear. The hon. Gentleman has overturned a policy which was being carried out by the Secretary of State for Transport, the right hon. Member for Stockton (Mr. Rodgers) until nine or 10 months ago and which had been carried out by his predecessors over the previous six years. That is fine. But now that the hon. Gentleman has overturned that policy—whiah he concedes that he has— I suggest that the public will want to know what he will put in its place. I suggest, from a fair reading of his speech, and having listened to it, that it will involve a greater direction of freight than has taken place before. I see that the hon. Gentleman concedes that that is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2166</span>
	<p>I should have thought that there is no difference. All of us in the Committee would like to see a greater share of freight business being taken by rail. However, the question of method is basic to that argument. We are saying in many ways what the previous Labour Government said, that there should be fair competition, that full track costs should be borne and that the customer should choose. The Labour Party now has chosen a different course, and I think that its change of direction is shown by the fact that Labour Members will vote, as I understand it, against a clause which abolishes the Freight Integration Council, which has not met since June 1971. They will vote against a clause which abolishes a special authorisation procedure for long-distance road transport which has never been invoked.</p>
	<p>Lastly, I believe the propositions in the clause to be self-evidently true. I do not believe that many people who look objectively at the evidence will think otherwise. I also believe sincerely that the public, having listened to the hon. Gentleman and the right hon. Gentleman, will want to know where the Labour Party stands on freight, because it has clearly moved radically and in a manner that I think is quite exceptional. I stand by what I said. I believe that the policy which it is choosing is, above all, against the interests of the customer— the public—and that seems to me to be a negation of transport policy.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill: —</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 7.</p>

	<div class='title'>CITATION, ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have three direct questions to ask the Minister. The first relates to subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) which appears to indicate that part II of the Bill would be effective on the passing of the Act. I cannot see how that can be so. A reading of part II shows that it can take effect only on the appointed day, which presumably is a much later date. Can the Minister explain why subsection (3) contains provision for all of part II, except section 42(2) and schedule 7, to come into effect on the passing of the Act? Is there some mechanism, which I have been unable to find in the Bill, which would allow some parts of part II to operate in advance of the appointed day?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next question relates to clause 57(5), which appears to cover the whole of part I of the Bill. There does not seem to be any other provision for bringing into operation part of part I. If so, how and when is part I to be brought into force? Is it the Minister's intention to bring it in a part at a time? If so, when? Is it to be this year, next year, some time or never? In particular, when does he intend to bring about the change from vehicle licensing to operator licensing, given that clause 57 is passed as it stands?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to subsection (6), which flabbergasts me. Talk about a sting in the tail! This neat little provision actually empowers the Minister to change primary law by statutory instrument. It states that he can make an order under subsection (5), which contains provisions involving modification of any statutory provision, presumably in this legislation or any other transport legislation directly covered by it. I am beginning to wonder what we have been doing all these days in Committee trying to define clearly and precisely, often without success, what the transport law will be, only to find, at the end of the Bill, that the Minister will have power to change it all as he brings it into effect. He can put changes in this law into statutory instruments at various times. Surely the power that he requires should
	<span class='label label-info column'>2168</span>
not be as wide as that. Such changes or limitations as he can make must surely be within the scope of the provisions of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have put those questions briefly, not because I do not attach importance to them, but to enable the Committee to judge the Minister's answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can deal with the three questions. Part II, as clause 57(5) makes clear, will come into effect at the date of Royal Assent. That means that it will come into force as a matter of law. As a body of law it will then be effective. But most of part II is enabling in its nature. As the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) said, part II begins by giving the Minister power to set an appointed day upon which most of the detailed provisions will start to take effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no contradiction between clause 57 and the terms of part II. There is no reason why part II should not become law as soon as Royal Assent is given. Part II contains details of the mechanism by which, at various stages, the Minister can exercise his powers to move over to transforming the National Freight Corporation to a private sector company and eventually to a flotation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the Government's present intention about bringing in part I, subsection (5) is the part of clause 57 which will give the Minister power to appoint appropriate days for the coming into force of that part of the legislation. There will have to be some delay following Royal Assent before the rather complex changes in the licensing system can be made fully effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As this stage it is not possible for me to commit myself to the definite dates when every feature of part I will be brought into effect, but the kind of timetable on which we are working is that, if the changes in road service licensing can be brought into effect in the autumn, it will probably be convenient for all concerned if they are brought into effect at the end of the summer. We believe that we can do the necessary preparatory work to enable October 1980 to be the date for the road service licensing provisions to come into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changeover to operate licensing and various other features of the Bill will take longer. I anticipate that the full
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1178">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2169</span>
change to the operator licensing system and all that goes with it will be effective towards the spring of 1981. The earliest date that I can envisage is February next year. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not mind if at this stage I give those broad brush indications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman pointed to the rather startling subsection (6) which, on the face of it, tucks in a broad sweeping power for the Minister to change any kind of statutory provision that may seem to him appropriate. There are times when all Ministers yearn for such a provision, because it would save debating time in Standing Committee and other Parliamentary procedures with which all Governments have to live. However, I assure the right hon. Gentleman that its scope is much more restricted than would appear. It is confined solely to enabling the Minister to make transitional arrangements as regards commencement orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The changeover from the present licensing system to the new system envisaged in the Bill will be a rather complex process. In order to ensure a smooth changeover, there will have to be many transitional provisions to deal with such things as the continuing validity of certificates and licences held at present, so that we do not accidentally put an operator or service out of business. To attempt to use the powers for anything wider than that purpose would, it seems, he successfully challenged in the courts. On the other hand, when making the commencement orders and varying them slightly in practice to make a smooth transition, it is desiralble in everyone's interests that maximum flexibility be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Committee that the Government have no intention of using the powers in subsection (6) for any wider purpose than making sure that the commencement orders make sense and can be adjusted where necessary to avoid upheaval in the industry. I also give the assurance that those involved in the passenger transport industry will be consulted about the necessary transitional provisions. I do not expect that we would make any variation of the statutory provisions unless there was fairly wide consent amongst all concerned1—trade unions, industry and so on—that a strict application of the statutory provisions
	<span class='label label-info column'>2170</span>
would lead to unnecessary paperwork, bureaucracy or confusion. It is narrow in compass and scope, the Government have no intention of using it in any wider way and I do not believe that the courts would allow us to do so even if we tried.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>2171</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall introduce these that everyone will agree that the Minibus Act 1977, which was designed" to help local authorities and voluntary organisations, has proved extremely useful. It had all-party support and certainly worked very successfully where the organisations wishing to make use of the Act owned their own vehicles. But we all know that vehicles are expensive to buy and run and that quite a number of voluntary organisations do not require the exclusive use of a vehicle all of the time and quite frequently they would like to be able to use the minibus belonging to some other voluntary organisation. I am told that this has proved difficult to arrange because of problems over the charging of fares—through fares being levied on the members of an organisation that does not own the vehicle. There are problems with whether the permits are in order and if the appropriate insurance cover is valid. Therefore, there are a considerable number of groups throughout the country interested in the co-operative or joint running and ownership of minibuses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to a particular example in my constituency It has been brought to my attention that the Camden council social service, with the help of Camden council, has been attempting to set up a cooperative or joint effort to try to get over that problem. A body called the Kentish Town Community Minibus Association operated a year or two ago and certainly proved that there was a considerable demand for these sorts of provisions. However, largely because Camden council, Camden council's social service and other voluntary organisations in the area are considerably more careful about keeping within the law than has been the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security recently, they are very concerned to ensure that they do nothing that is either illegal or brings into doubt the insurance cover of passengers and themselves. Consequently, I tabled new clause 24 which seeks to empower the Minister in any cases put to him by a local authority to authorise specifically a scheme for cooperative and joint ownership which would get round any of the problems that have arisen in the past. I believe that the clause as drafted provides plenty of protection to ensure that that provision is not misused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2172</span>
I accept that this is a very crude shot by me at drafting a clause to cover the point. By and large, my view is that if the Minister can do any better with the help of his advisers I shall be happy to accept that. Having talked to certain lawyers before I drafted these new clauses, I concluded that I was better off drafting them myself because in that way I could epitomise the problem and so make clear to the Minister what sort of problems people have and how they might be overcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The groups about which I have been talking have had discussions with officials of the Ministry of Transport for a considerable period. Up to now, those officials have shared my view about the doubtful legality of a joint or cooperative scheme. But I am now told that as recently as yesterday morning those same officials suddenly announced that they felt an operation of that sort was within the law. No one is beyond redemption; conversions are always welcome. However, it is not the same as St. Paul's conversion on the road to Damascus; it is as though he were knocking on the gate before it occurred. Therefore I am a little doubtful about the matter. It is very convenient that Ministry of Transport officials should have seen the light in that way, because they are relieved of the duty of doing anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do nothing about the matter they need do nothing either. Any voluntary organisations that wish to run a cooperative or joint effort will be obliged to try to formulate something in the law. As they are responsible organisations that frequently move old and disabled people and children about they want to be certain when making special provisions to help certain groups in the community that those groups will be safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may reply that that would be within the law. I propose that those organising the scheme with the Camden council of social service go away, having received the advice of the Ministry of Transport, to formulate a plan that they can put to their lawyers and insurers. If there is confirmation that they would be within the law and would have appropriate insurance cover, I should be happy to withdraw new clause 24 with the Committee's leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2173</span>
But that would be only if the Minister gave an undertaking that if the outcome of those approaches to the lawyers and insurers was that the Minister's views were not shared he would be prepared to introduce an appropriate new clause later in the Bill's passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to new clause 25, which is more straightforward. I am sure that it was never the intention of the Minibus Act of 1977 that a minibus with tail-lift gear for lifting disabled people's wheelchairs into the vehicle would come outside its scope. That was never in anyone's mind, but it has been a product of the Act and consequent regulations. In those circumstances, I am sure that the Committee will be with me in respect of the objective of the clause. I seek to ensure that under the Minibus Act no vehicle's use should be prevented solely because it has a tail-lift device for wheelchairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discovered a further complication since drafting the new clause. In most minibus designs the largest number of wheelchairs that can be carried is six. But the Minibus Act covers vehicles carrying seven to 16 passengers. I hope that the Minister will be able to deal with that either by way of regulation or through a fairly minor amendment to the Bill at a later stage. It is imperative to ensure that the Minibus Act covers a substantial chunk of those whom it was intended to cover but who have been excluded from it entirely by accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is then the rather more controversial proposal, in new clause 26, that people running joint schemes for the operation of minibuses should be allowed to use vehicles larger than the 16-seater maximum permitted size. Again, people running these co-operative schemes have found that a number of organisations wishing to organise a holiday weekend or even a holiday week would find it a great advantage to have, say, one large vehicle in the pool owned by a group of voluntary organisations. Instead of having to shift, say, 20 or 30 disabled people to Bournemouth for a week's holiday by using a minibus twice, those disabled people, or indeed children from a youth club, or a football team and its supporters, could then travel in a rather larger vehicle. All of that, of course, would be on the clear under-
	<span class='label label-info column'>2174</span>
standing that such use would be by voluntary organisations and should not be allowed to be extended or to take contract carriage work from established operators. It would also be useful if some form of tail-lift or other access for the disabled in wheelchairs were allowed in this type of coach owned and operated by voluntary organisations seeking to provide services for these various groups. Whilst not all of them are deprived, many of them may be severely deprived as a result of disablement, old age, sickness, or even just because they are very young.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will respond favourably to all three new clauses, even if he does not relish any of them as they have been crudely drafted by me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) on putting forward some very interesting ideas. As a member of the all-party disablement group, I am sure that the first two clauses would have considerable support both in the Committee and throughout the House. Having come across some of the problems covered by new clause 24 with the Fellowship for the Handicapped in Chelmsley Wood in my constituency, I strongly suggest that consideration be given to those. I share with the hon. Gentleman a great interest in the drafting language of lawyers, and I admire his skill in drafting his proposals. He has made his position very clear. So long as the Minister is prepared to consider the principle of the new clauses, I thoroughly support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Committee's proceedings are nearing their conclusion, and that we shall probably conclude on a helpful and constructive note in considering these small but important points arising out of the operation of the Minibus Act. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) that it is useful to debate these matters, and we are grateful to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) for raising them. I have been following the discussions taking place between my officials and Camden council about its community bus scheme. Similar problems no doubt occur in other areas, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2175</span>
I think that many other voluntary bodies and local authorities throughout the country would be interested in the correction of one or two of the minor defects in the Minibus Act. I say "minor" because I think that the Minibus Act is widely accepted as having been a success, with only small snags arising in its operation. We should like to build upon that success, if we can, by taking the opportunity of this Bill to put those problems right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first problem that arises, which is dealt with in new clause 24, is what happens when a vehicle pool is used by a variety of voluntary bodies. I believe that Camden want to set up a system whereby the council holds the buses but the scouts, the disabled and various other groups use the vehicles from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minibus Act now stands, if it is organised in the usual way a permit for each vehicle must be held by the body using it at any given time. That has given rise to considerable difficulties and has impeded the development of a more co-operative arrangement being organised by the council for a large number of bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South built on odd conversations that we had before the debate started, so he anticipated my reply. On examination of the wording of the Minibus Act there appears to be no reason why an organisation should not be set up which could over-ride this difficulty without any change in the law. There appears to be nothing in the Act to prevent the formation of a new vehicle pooling body with the specific purpose of providing transport for welfare and similar purposes within the meaning of the Minibus Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of individual organisations wishing to use vehicles owned or operated by the pool could become members of the new body. Permits for individual vehicles could then be issued by the new body. My advisers feel that the relevant criterion which the Act requires to be met is that the use of the vehicle is by the body to whom the permit was granted. It would, therefore, need to remain clear when a particular vehicle was being used that it was being used not by the scouts, or whoever it happened to be, but by a member of the pooling body. Provided the members of
	<span class='label label-info column'>2176</span>
all the individual organisations are members of this umbrella organisation the suggestion is that the technical difficulty could be avoided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What it amounts to is that there is a possibility that on the correct reading of the present Act it would be comparatively simple for Camden or others to organise a pooling arrangement by setting up an umbrella organisation to which members of all the other voluntary bodies could belong. They could then operate the vehicles perfectly lawfully and the insurance and other worries would be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand the hon. Gentleman's scepticism about the sudden discovery that this problem which has vexed several councils for so long was never a problem and, therefore, there is no need to change the law. I also accept that it is one thing to be given legal advice about this but quite another for a council or voluntary body to contemplate legal action in a test case to sort it out. We wish to avoid that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, building on what the hon. Gentleman said, I suggest that now I have outlined that possibility we should continue to investigate the matter further. I shall welcome any legal or other representations from Camden or anyone else which cast doubt on my suggestion, or illustrate difficulties that might arise. I certainly give the undertaking that if there is still confusion clarifying amendments will be tabled at a later stage in the Bill to make the position under the Minibus Act clear and to permit such an obviously desirable arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerns a problem that has arisen with those vehicles which have tail lifts to enable disabled people in wheel chairs to get in and out of the vehicle. At the moment, minibuses are exempt from a number of licensing and other provisions, but because of the need to ensure that they are safe, as for any other PSVs, they must comply with the provisions of the Minibus (Conditions of Fitness, Equipment and Use) Regulations 1977. Under regulation 13 a vehicle with the fuel tank behind the rear wheels must have two exits—one on the near side, which is not an emergency exit, and an emergency exit on the offside or rear. In the case of vehicles where the fuel tank is not behind the rear wheels a single exit, which must also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2177</span>
serve as an emergency exit, is permissible. Regulations 15 and 16 contain provisions as to those doors and emergency exits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The snag is that when there is a tail lift to enable wheel-chairs to enter, it can, in the retracted position, obstruct free access to the emergency exit. It has been found that some vehicles that have been specially adapted for the disabled in wheelchairs are, probably inadvertently, not able to comply with the strict terms of the regulations. That obstructs the use of these vehicles by voluntary bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that there is on the market one type of device, produced by one manufacturer only, which incorporates nylon mushroom clips rather than conventional metal slide locks in its fittings when it is retracted. Therefore, as I understand it, it is possible for it to be easily pushed out of the way. If that device is fitted, the present regulations are complied with. That does not seem to me a wholly satisfactory answer to the problem. I appreciate that a problem has arisen, and it is necessary for the Government to look at the matter again. I suggest that it is not right to deal with it in the main legislation. The terms of the regulations should be examined to see whether a straightforward amendment can be made to allow properly adapted vehicles to be exempt from their present strict application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are one or two matters on which we agree. It is clearly not right to dispense with straightforward and sensible safety provisions just because the people in the vehicle happen to be disabled. Where there are disabled in wheelchairs, slightly different provisions are required, because, obviously, they are not in a position to leap for the exits if the vehicle overturns. On the other hand, there may be able-bodied people inside the vehicle who could make use of emergency exits. Proper emergency exits could also be invaluable if a vehicle overturned and people outside had to get into the vehicle in order to help out people in wheelchairs. I am not suggesting, as the new clause seems to, that the requirements about emergency exits should be waived altogether for specially adapted vehicles. We shall examine what practical and sensible steps can be taken to amend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2178</span>
regulations to allow adapted vehicles to comply with them while retaining a minimum standard of safety and access from inside and out in times of emergency, a standard which is necessary to protect the disabled just like any other passengers. We shall announce progress at a later stage. I hope that the Committee will be content with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third new clause seeks to enable local authority sponsored vehicle pooling schemes and others to use vehicles with more than 16 seats under a Minibus Act permit. That arises again, I gather, from Camden's desire to have a broad-ranging fleet of vehicles. They want to have some vehicles with more than 16 seats to carry the disabled and other groups. The same situation applies throughout the country. Camden is pressing it at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South did not press this new clause with the force with which he pressed his others. However, as we are near the end of the Committee stage and I am in a very forthcoming mood, this seems to me just as sensible as his other two new clauses. We shall examine what changes are necessary to meet him part way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present his drafting is defective. I shall not bore the Committee on its last morning with details of why that is so. We have not yet prepared a draft. At the moment, if vehicles of more than 16 seats were operated by a voluntary body, under the Act, they would need road service licensing and operator licensing, thereby needing a transport manager with his valuable certificate of professional competence and all the other safety requirements of the Minibus Act in order to operate it. That seems to me to be somewhat onerous to the voluntary bodies about which we are talking. I accept what the hon. Member says. In respect of the Minibus Act, we are concerned only with voluntary bodies which we trust are responsible. There is no question of using the Minibus Act to open the door to various commercial activities loosely tacked on to voluntary organisations and clubs. We should have to look at the categories to which we confined the regulations. However, for certain categories of bodies—local authorities and some of the larger, more responsible bodies— there seems no case at all for retaining
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I1183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2179</span>
road service licensing, nor for retaining operator licensing, but every case for retaining some checks over safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, subject to there being no question of our abandoning the right of our vehicle examiners to inspect vehicles, nor of our relaxing the rules under the Minibus Act which relate to the engineering, safety and construction of the vehicle, we shall produce proposals which will aim to relax the strict operation of operator licensing and road service licensing for larger vehicles when they are part of a fleet operated by a strictly defined category of voluntary bodies. Those bodies will be under the control of the Minister, so he has an absolute right to control who is added to them and who is not, to make sure that there is no abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those undertakings—which I think are some of the more generous that I have given in the course of the proceedings on the Bill—I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to withdraw each of his new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put on record my appreciation of and thanks for the Parliamentary Secretary's helpful response, not only in Committee, but in the discussions that I have had with him outside the Committee about the concepts behind these three new clauses. I am very grateful for that, and I am sure that those who will benefit from the changes will be equally grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share with him the desire to make sure that nothing under the Minibus Act, or any minor variations or extensions which may flow from these new clauses, should in any way lead to reductions in safety. Indeed, as I think I said in discussing an earlier aspect of the Bill, some of the dodgiest vehicles to be seen on the streets appear to be minibuses run by voluntary organisations. A co-operative get-together with central servicing and some specialist knowledge may enhance safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister proposes doing what he can to change the regulations to include tail-lift vehicles within the ambit of the Minibus Act, I should like the assurance that existing vehicles with existing tail-lift devices will be covered, and that the regulations will not be directed to bringing in newly-equipped vehicles in the future. The bulk of
	<span class='label label-info column'>2180</span>
vehicles with tail-lift devices that will be running five years from now are already on the road. There will be only a marginal increment of new vehicles over the next five years. It would be extremely expensive for voluntary organisations that are scraping away to provide services for the disabled to re-equip their vehicles. Therefore, I hope that existing vehicles will fall within the new regulations. Subject to that understanding, which I gather that I have from the Parliamentary Secretary who is nodding and smiling, I shall be happy to withdraw these three clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it would be satisfactory to say that it would be possible to convert all existing vehicles. The snag is that any change in the present regulations involves a slightly lower level of safety being accepted in this one respect, for present vehicles. It seems to me that it would be the wish of the Committee to accept a slightly lower standard of safety for emergency exits in buses where wheelchairs are loaded in and out. There is almost an engineering problem of how far one should go, but the intention would be, so far as possible, to allow the best of present vehicles to comply with the regulations and to amend the regulations to fit the vehicles, rather than just to issue advice about what further costly conversions could be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would be helpful if the Government could give us some advance advice whenever they seek to do that. I have been unable to find a copy of the Transport (London) Act 1969 containing the subsection (4) (	<i>a</i>) in question. It is certainly not in the Library copy, and the section as it appears in the Encyclopedia of Road Traffic Law would seem to indicate that an amendment was made in the Transport Act 1978 which took out this subsection (4)(	<i>a</i>). But the Opposition in the Committee, Mr. Lamond, as you and other Chairmen under whom we have sat must have observed, are ever practical, constructive, responsible and responsive to the needs of Government wherever that makes sense. We believe that this makes eminent sense and we shall be happy to support the Government, particularly with amendment No. 132.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
