	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 307, in page 34, line 28, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that subsection (4) proposes that where any of the subsidiary companies of the National Freight Corporation accrue profits out of which they might pay dividends before the establishment of the successor company, those profits will be available to be paid to the successor company. That means the profits which accrue from public investment, and public expenditure generally, and the efforts of people working in the public sector, will be devoted automatically to making the new successor company yet more attractive to potential purchasers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already heard that in an effort to make the company more attractive the Government proposes to write off £100 million capital debt. They also intend that the Transport Act 1978 grants, which admittedly are small, are likely to continue. In addition, the Minister has said he will further reflect on the possibility of allowing the tax losses which NFC is presently accruing to carry forward to reduce the amount of tax paid by the new company when it comes into existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are faced, therefore, with capital debt being written off, Government grants intended for the public sector continuing into the private sector, and the possible writing off of tax losses incurred in the public sector being used to the benefit of the company in the private sector. All these are to help make the company more attractive. That is simply handing over public money to the private sector. No doubt we will then hear how much more effective and efficient the private sector is—and so it ought to be after having all those burdens lifted from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put the matter in perspective I should put on record the scale of funds which may be involved. We do not have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1750</span>
the figures for 1979. The latest published figures that I have of profits for the NFC's subsidiary companies are those for 1978. BRS made a profit, after allowing for tax, and so on, of £2.5 million; National Carriers made a profit of £2.7 million; Special Traffics, £2.2 million; Pickfords Removals, £2.7 million; Tankfreight £1 million. Two of the subsidiaries, Roadline and Lawther and Harvey made losses. All the other subsidiaries made a profit. We are, then, talking of that money being handed over to the new company rather than being devoted to other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might reasonably ask what those other purposes might be. As these profits result from much hard work by a large number of people in the industry, the first call on these funds should be to ensure the proper financing of the pensions of those whose work has made those profits possible. For that reason, the Opposition believe that the profits accrued by subsidiary companies before the new company comes into existence should not accrue to the new company. They should be used for the purposes I have mentioned or taken entirely away from the National Freight Corporation and donated to some other area of public transport expenditure. If the Government cannot make the company attractive enough with the other write-offs and benefits that they are offering—other bits of the dowry that the taxpayer will give to go along with the NFC—it makes their performance even more pathetic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister first introduced the Bill he said that one of its main objects was to change the NFC into a Companies Act company. The amendment seeks to ensure that the normal practice is followed when one company is transferred to another. It would attempt to prevent the reserves of the NFC being turned into capital, and to hold them as reserves available for distribution as dividends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should say why they are doing this. If they believe that the NFC should operate like any other company and should be exposed to what they describe as the normal rigours and disciplines of commercial operation, sure they believe that when it is transferred the normal commercial procedure should be followed. The clause specifically forbids that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect may well be, as my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1751</span>
Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) has said, to confer on those who purchase this public asset the right to obtain a benefit which would not normally be obtained when someone bought shares in a company that was transferred for the purpose of its sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In pursuing this issue we are in a considerable dilemma from the information provided by the Minister so far. He said that within the provisions of the Bill in changing the capital loan and the initial capital of the NFC into shares, it is open for part of them to be turned into fixed interest shares—for instance, fixed interest transferable stock—and part into equity shares. If that happens, and a pay-out of dividends is made, using what are now the reserves of the NFC, clearly the benefit can be conferred only on those who have the equity shares, as presumably the fixed interest stock will not be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have however had no declaration as to what part of the stock the Government will hold, what part they will float or what instructions they will give to brokers when they come to sell this public asset as to which shares they are to float first or whether they are to put all of them up for options. Our amendment that attempted to limit the number of shares that could be floated at any one time was rejected, so I hold that we are entitled to assume that the Government want complete freedom to decide on the proportion of shares to be offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a dividend is paid using what are now reserves I believe that a benefit will be conferred upon those who hold the equity stock. Therefore, that may affect the price at which the equity stock can be sold. Again, the nominal value is within the control of the Minister and we do not know what that is to be. It will not necessarily equal the valuation of the company. He may choose to set the value lower or higher than that and argue that that can be justified in terms of maximising the return. Again, we do not know and are left with the awful dilemma of trying to discuss the serious proposition that a public asset should be turned over to a private company without knowing the financial construction within which that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to go in depth into the clear purpose, objective and merit of an amendment that would at least prevent that and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1752</span>
enable us to ensure that the Bill provides for a transfer which would be more akin to a transfer of assets from one company to another. In so doing we should provide another form of protection of money earned by a wholly-owned public operation on which dividends accrued as a result of public funding. But before we can do that we must have an explanation from the Minister why the clause is so constructed. Then we can discuss it in a serious way and attach to the amendment the importance it deserves given that this transaction appears to be a rip-off, in the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the Minister will clearly explain what scope and justification there can be for enabling publicly earned and publicly owned dividends to be made available for distribution to some, presumably, of those who buy shares in the NFC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport [Mr. Kenneth Clarke]</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we get to the amendments on this clause we are moving into a highly technical area arising out of company law. This is a subject that I studied as a student and to which I have not since returned. Half-remembered student learning is a worse guide than no learning at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Chair sympathises for exactly the same reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may have better recall than I Mr. English, the technicalities of the Companies Act and I congratulate Labour Members for their amendments on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned essentially with technical problems that arise out of the nature of the transaction in which we are engaged, that is, creating a Companies Act company out of a statutory corporation. Certain provisions of the Companies Act that would apply to the case of a takeover—the analogy just used by the right hon. Gentleman—are not appropriate to the exercise in which we are engaged. The clause makes clear precisely what the capital structure of the company will be and avoids what would otherwise be unnecessary and absurd consequences of the application of the Companies Act 1948.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no analogy with a take-over because we are engaged in a different exercise. We are turning a statutory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0952">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1753</span>
corporation with no capital structure, except for a lot of fixed-interest debt of one sort or another to the Government, into a Companies Act company. We are providing a new capital structure. There is no need whatever to capitalise income that has been earned from the trading record of the subsidiaries before the creation of a new company. The broad thread of policy in what we are doing in creating the new company is to try to put it in the position of an ordinary Companies Act company throughout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim of the taxation provisions, with which I shall deal in a moment, is to try to arrange that the company goes on in its new existence as though it had been an ordinary Companies Act company throughout. Taxation was rightly mentioned by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson). It was first touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) in the debate on clause 36.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has just said that the broad thread of policy is to think of this as though it were a private sector transaction in terms of company law and to get as close to that as possible. If this were close to a private sector transaction, would not stamp duty have to be paid on the transfer of shares? As I understand it, no stamp duty will be paid. Therefore, that leaves this argument very far removed from a private sector transaction. Am I right in saying that stamp duty will not be paid when the shares are transferred to the Minister, nor when the shares are transferred from the Minister to private buyers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, no stamp duty will be paid when we create new shares which are held by the Minister. I shall take advice on whether stamp duty will be payable if and when the Minister disposes of them in the flotation. My initial assumption would be "yes," but I shall take advice.
The analogy with a private transaction is not really appropriate. We are not engaged in a private transaction, takeover or transfer of assets. These are already publicly-owned assets for which the Minister is responsible. We are merely changing the nature and structure of the corporation. We are turning it into a Companies Act
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1754</span>
company with a capital structure with various accumulated income and reserves from income available for distribution. We are also trying to put it into a position as if it had been a Companies Act company all along, before, during and after the transformation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the taxation question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham last Thursday, that is also the policy that has been applied by the Government to the treatment of the new company for taxation purposes, including the problem of accumulated tax losses. I said at that time that the matter was still under active consideration and that I would let my hon. Friend know when a conclusion was reached. I did not then know that the Treasury and the Inland Revenue, as ever, were doing good by stealth and had already declared the conclusion at which they had arrived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will find the answer in two Written Answers given by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary on 18 January, which I had overlooked as, no doubt, had most other members of the Committee. In those Written Answers, my hon. Friend made two announcements which bear on the problem. In the first, at column 	<i>895</i> of the 	<i>Official Report,</i> my hon. Friend said that the Government did not intend to introduce retrospective legislation for the writing down of the accumulated tax losses of nationalised industries which have had their loans from the Government or thier public dividend capital written down. In the second, he said that the tax arrangements for statutory corporations which are to be converted into companies
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be such as to leave the successor companies in effectively the same position as if they had in the first instance been normal companies rather than statutory corporations. I therefore propose to introduce legislation to correct certain disadvantages which would otherwise arise merely because the nationalised industries do not already have the legal form of Companies Act companies."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 18 January 1980; Vol. 976,c.	<i>896.</i>]</p></blockquote>
The result is that successor companies will be treated for taxation purposes as though they had been normal companies throughout. That means that the tax losses which concerned my hon. Friend will be available to the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot give any undertakings as to when the necessary legislation will be introduced. Clearly, I cannot predict what may or may not be included in the Finance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0953">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1755</span>
Bill, so I cannot elaborate on the assurance given by my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary that he intends to introduce the necessary legislation at an appropriate stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham asked particularly about section 278 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 and the application of development land tax to the new company. The second of the Financial Secretary's written answers contains the answer to that query and sets out the policy to which we are working. The objective is to ensure that the conversion of a statutory corporation into a successor company will be neutral in respect of tax liabilities. Otherwise, we envisage that the normal taxation rules will apply to the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that what I have said is difficult to absorb. It is easier to understand when read, but I shall be happy to hand a copy of my brief to the Opposition. I fully understand that they may wish to reserve detailed comment until they have been able to read the 	<i>Official Report</i> and to accumulate the wisdom of my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is similar in respect of subsection (4). The provision is necessary to deal with a technical problem that might occur as a result of the transfer of the NFC's undertakings to the successor company. It is intended to ensure that any dividends paid to the company in respect of shares—particularly from the subsidiary companies—tiansferred as part of the undertaking of the NFC will be available to the successor company as distributable resources. Without a specific provision on those lines, the dividends might be regarded as having arisen out of pre-acquisition profits, and therefore, under company law, not available for distribution by the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Company law ordinarily deals with a different case—a takeover. There is no reason why income should be capitalised in this instance. We shall not be depriving the public in any way by taking the course that we propose. We are simply ensuring that the company will have a common-sense capital structure. There is no need whatever to lock into that any past earnings from subsidiaries as non-distributable capital which should be available for distribution in the ordinary way. We are certainly not wasting capital in a way that would shock our frugal and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1756</span>
prudent grandfathers, who always believed that one should never distribute or disperse capital. We are dealing only with income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that to a slight extent the provision may have the effect of making the company more attractive to investors, but not in an improper way. We are not making public capital assets available for distribution, but merely allowing the company the access that any Companies Act company would expect to have to the earnings of its subsidiaries. It is a technicality and avoids what otherwise would be an unnecessary and slightly anomalous consequence of a strict application of the Companies Act. I hope that the Committee will agree that the political fears expressed in the Committee are not justified and that this perfectly sensible provision should be allowed to stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that if the provision were not in the Bill funds could be carried over to the successor company, but not be in the form of ready money that could be handed out as quickly as possible to the new shareholders by way of dividends. It seems to me that the payment of a dividend to those shareholders on the strength of work carried out by the predecessor—a nationalised organisation—should be the last call on any funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot possibly accept the points made by the Minister about the proper priorities for the use of those funds. I should like to go on to deal with his response to what I said when introducing the amendment about the use by the new company of tax losses accrued while the corporation was in the public sector. The Parliamentary Secretary may be right in saying that we shall have to look carefully at the details before we can make any comment. But that does not mean that we need to look at it all that carefully before asking one important question. I should have thought that Government Members—the alleged guardians of the public purse—as well as Opposition Members should ask one question before they support the Bill. The question is how much money is at stake? How great a loss of public revenue is likely to result from the provision? I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary is in a position to tell us the sums involved. They should be readily calculable. The Inland Revenue should know what tax losses have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0954">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1757</span>
accrued by the NFC to date. If we knew that, we would have a datum point from which we could start guessing the likely effects of the new company being able to use those losses in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This side of the Committee has been subjected by the Parliamentary Secretary to a shrewd line of political argument. That is not unusual. However, I must make one or two comments about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First he said that the Government are trying to make the transaction similar to a private transaction. If it were a private transaction, he said, certain things would occur and that the transaction will follow that pattern. When we press him he says "Ah, yes, but a public corporation is being transferred. Therefore in some ways things will have to be a little different." We are trying to ferret out when things are to be similar and when they are to be a little different. As the Opposition anticipated, the catch answer is that the selling off of the corporation will coincide with a private transaction or a public transaction, as it suits the Minister's book. The Opposition are being pinned down by Morton's fork. Roughly translated that means, "Heads we lose—tails we lose."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary is presenting the argument in a way that he thinks will relieve our anxieties. However, my anxieties are not relieved at all. He knows the Bill well. Whenever he has to read a brief I start to have doubts. He read a brief a few moments ago, and I thought that he was doing so because he was not sure of some of the implications of the matter under discussion. In such circumstances we need to examine what he says pretty critically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government's selective approach to when the transaction should be put on all fours with a private transaction reflects on another issue? Does he agree that if an existing private company had a fully funded pension scheme any successor company would have to continue it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that that was absolutely correct. I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He has indeed pointed out the discrepancies in the Minister's argument. What is happening is that the Parliamentary Secretary, at least in the way he presented it to us, is picking
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1758</span>
and choosing the bits and pieces to suit his own political case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not surprised at that, because it is what all politicians do. But let us not run away with the story that the main selective interest is to safeguard public money. It is not. The overwhelming case that is being put forward—we are criticising it in this amendment—is that the Minister is making a selective appraisal in order to make it as attractive as possible to sell the assets of this company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the surplus that has accrued in terms of profits being transferred. I do not see why a fairly easy mathematical calculation should not be made so that there will be a fair division of that surplus, some going into the consolidated fund and the rest to the successor company, so that the framework of a fair deal can be constructed if desired. But that is not happening. The clause—in layman's language such as one may hear in the main street of Ipswich—is setting it all out so that the successor company can syphon off the money straight away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Parliamentary Secretary said "Of course, these are very technical matters", my suspicions were aroused even more. It is the universal practice to take refuge behind technicalities to achieve one's political purposes. I understand that it is a difficult exercise to transfer the substance of a public company to a successor private company under the Companies Act. It is not a straightforward but a hybrid transaction, which must throw up complications. However, the Opposition are concerned to see our way through the complexities and ensure that the public have a fair deal from this transaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that where one company is being bought out by another, the purpose of the limitations that the Companies Act places on what may be done with the dividends of the first company is to protect the shareholders of the first company? The situation is analogous. We seek to protect the position of the public, who are the present owners of the NFC, against losses attending legislation which makes it possible for the NFC to be totally sold to a private company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention. That sums
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0955">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1759</span>
up, in a couple of sentences, the main burden of our case. If it were a straightforward transfer between one private company and another, there is a framework of rules in the Companies Act to protect at all stages the shareholders, not only of the company itself, but also of the successor company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we are talking about safeguards for the public that must be put on this transfer not by any Act of Parliament, because—an unusual situation—we do not have one, but by the Opposition, because we are scrutinising the Bill on behalf of the public. It seems to me, from reading the clause and from the explanation that we have been given by the Parliamentary Secretary, that every ounce of our scrutiny will be needed, because this transfer has a pretty doubtful record so far. In order to dress up the shop window, £100 million worth has already been written off in order to sell the equity.

The Government have excused themselves from stamp duty. I do not yet know whether any stamp duty will be levied when purchasers buy shares from the Minister. That has not been made clear. There is certainly no stamp duty on the first transfer. People in my constituency will be groaning under the yoke of stamp duty on the transfer of residential property. A transfer will be made for the political purposes of the Government where no stamp duty will be paid. That is pretty sharp practice. Moreover, the tax losses will be carried forward as some sort of positive factor in the credit balance for the successor company. When all that raked together one gets a pretty doubtful story which the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to get away with. The amendment seeks to provide for scrutiny, to omit subsection (4) and adjust the balance so that there is some fairness to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are bound to be difficulties in the Government's policy. But the unusual nature of the policy, and the unusual nature of the exercise enables the Parliamentary Secretary to guide the whole process to suit his convenience. His policies do not necessarily give a fair deal to the taxpayers who own the NFC and stand to lose by the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not had a convincing reply from the Parliamentary Secretary in response to the amendment. We need more assurances before we can be content that the public are receiving a fair crack of the whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One could argue that amendment No. 307 does not go as far as the Opposition want to go. Amendment No. 291 would take care of that but, unfortunately, it has not been called. That amendment proposes that the dividend be
	<br><blockquote><p>"paid into the Consolidated Fund".</p></blockquote>
The Parliamentary Secretary has given us one of the worst answers that we have had since the Committee commenced its proceedings. He is normally extremely good, but in this case he is struggling to justify the subsection. He has shown the Opposition that he is struggling, and he has not convinced anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No matter how the Government try to disguise the truth, the subsection is included to make shares more attractive to potential buyers. There is no other reason. Not satisfied with writing off £100 million of taxpayers' money, the Government seek to make the shares more attractive by including this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again the Parliamentary Secretary reiterated the words that the transaction is not private. He then tried to justify treating it as if it were. That is nonsense and illogical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that we are dealing with about 50 subsidiaries which make up the whole of the NFC. The 1978 NFC accounts give an indication of what is behind the subsection. British Road Services made £8.8 million. National Carriers made £2.7 million; Special Traffics Group £1.8 million; Pickfords £0.5 million; and Freight Computer Services £0.5 million. That capital becomes immediately available for distribution from each of those subsidiaries. Time and again the Opposition have asked whether the NFC will retain its entirety. To be fair to the Minister, he has come up with what we knew all the time, that even if he said that it will he cannot ensure it. Once the successor company takes over, that is virtually out of his hands and once the company starts selling shares that is also out of his hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After a long struggle the NFC is moving into profitability, but now it is to be hived off into the private sector. When the NFC was having difficulties no one suggested that it should be sold to the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the £8.8 million capital of BRS immediately becomes available for distribution. When one relates that to shares the real political dogma behind the clause becomes apparent. That is

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1761</span>
what it is all about. Had we been given a positive assurance that the NFC would be kept in its entirety, our case could not have been argued. But when my hon. Friend said that the subsection was a rip-off he understated the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of my hon. Friend's have been a bit hard on the Parliamentary Secretary. He has put up a good defence of the subsection against the amendment, given the appalling proposition that the subsection contains. The proposition is so appalling, when judged by any reasonable standards of fairness in the treatment of an asset or a public company, that it is almost indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary is using a shrewd argument. It is the best that can be thought of for the position that he has to defend. He appears to argue that the sale of this public asset to the private sector is not analogous to a company being sold or being taken over. He says that when a company buys all the shares that represent the NFC, that is not analogous to a company buying another company under the take-over bid arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary does not deny that it is possible for that to happen. He does not deny that the Bill gives the Minister an option to sell out the NFC assets in their entirety to another company. He seeks to persuade us that that is not analogous and, therefore, the public do not need the same protection, as owners of NFC, that they would need as private citizens with shares in NFC if it was being purchased by another company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the Parliamentary Secretary's proposition, and I want to examine it carefully. Why should the public require that protection? What is it about the dividends of NFC, and the ability of a successor company to distribute them, that is different from one company taking over another and being able to distribute its dividends? It is only different because this subsection allows the distribution of dividends in a way which would never be allowed if a private company were taking over another. That is the essential difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should not the dividends which are held by NFC be capitalised and included within the total share valuation of NFC and be put up for sale to ensure that the public get a return on dividends that have been earned by a public holding?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim to have a great knowledge
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1762</span>
of company law, but I have been trying to acquire sufficient knowledge to understand how the Minister's proposals for the sale of a public corporation compare with the sale of a private company. The onus is on the Minister to instruct the Committee on that difference. The Committee must understand at least that much of company law in order to make an intelligent decision. We cannot go to the country and plead ignorance, saying "Sorry we did not protect the public interest because we did not know enough about company law." That is no defence. We must understand at least sufficient to make a fair and intelligent judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there will be a valuation of the whole of its assets, including any accumulated dividends. It will be open, as I understand it, to that company, if it is negotiating a takeover bid, to offer the company at a nominal share value; that is, at less than that total valuation. It will be legal to do that. But in that event, the difference between the nominal price at which that company is offered and the total value has to be treated in a special way—I believe that it has to be put into a premium account. I do not know whether my description there is technically correct, but I believe that there is a special account covering the difference between the face value at which the company is offered and the actuarial valuation. The amount put into that account is not available to whoever buys the company to distribute freely as dividend. It is subject to special protections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It behoves the Parliamentary Secretary to outline to the Committee those special protections and to explain why they should not exist when a public asset is sold off, as they are when a private asset is sold off. If they are not free for distribution in the case of a private company, why should they be free for distribution when dividends have been earned on a public asset by the NFC in a tough competitive market? The NFC is not in a monopoly position. There is no argument about that. It is not as though we were selling off British Gas—thank goodness—or British Rail. We are not dealing with a monopoly undertaking. We are talking of selling off a public holding in a highly competitive area. There is no question in my mind that the public have the right to expect a return on, or some protection of those dividends
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0957">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1763</span>
which the NFC has earned as a public operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause attempts to get round the Companies Act limitation that normally applies. It is one of several conjuring tricks in the Bill. Here the conjurer steps up and says "This is what is happening" and persuades the audience to believe that that rather than the reality, is happening. The reality is that the dividend has been earned over a considerable period of time—at least over the last year of the NFC's operation. The conjuring trick is to say, "That is not what happened. All these dividends have suddenly been earned in a flash at the time the company was being transferred from the public holding to the subsidiary company." Therefore, the public do not have the same hold on them as they would have had if the shares had been held separately. This is one of those conjuring tricks in which the public are told, "You are not really shareholders in the NFC in the same way as people who hold shares in a private company. Your assets do not need that kind of protection. Those dividends that were earned while you possessed the NFC were not really so earned. They have suddenly become available by a wand being waved over the NFC to turn it into a subsidiary company." That is an indefensible proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Parliamentary Secretary can persuade the Committee that the clause does not do that, we might have reason to withdraw our amendment. But up to now, he has said nothing that persuades me that that is not what the Government propose. He is trying to get the Committee to remove from the British public a protection to which they would have every legal right but for the clause, and which they would certainly expect if they held those shares not through the auspices of the Government, but through the auspices normally provided by the Companies Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should begin by answering a couple of the specific queries that were raised and then try once more to put the issue into its general context and satisfy members of the Committee about the motives and effect of the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already told the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) stamp duty is not payable when one is forming a new company as in this case and the Minister is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1764</span>
taking all the shares. Clearly, thereafter, a sale of shares upon a flotation would normally be liable to 	<i>ad valorem</i> stamp duty but there is a general exemption from the payment of stamp duty for transactions of this kind involving Ministers. The Minister of Transport has that exemption from 	<i>ad valorem</i> stamp duty for this and all other purposes under the transfer of functions order which was placed before the House at the beginning of the Session which gives him all the immunities previously held in this regard by Ministers of Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Capital stamp duty is normally payable on the increase in capital involved in creating a company. But there is a specific provision in clause 37(6), which the Committee considered and approved, which provides that stamp duty shall not be chargeable under the appropriate section of the Finance Act 1973 in relation to the creation of this new company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about the size of the tax losses, the treatment of which I have explained and for which proposals for treatment by the Government as part of their intentions in dealing with tax losses and other tax problems is set out in the two Parliamentary Questions to which I referred. The amounts of the present losses and capital allowances are to be found in the NFC's report and accounts for 1978. Paragraph 9, page 43 of the Notes on the Accounts states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unused losses and capital allowances carried forward by certain subsidiaries at 31st December 1978 are estimated at approximately £45 million."</p></blockquote>
I believe that the majority of those arise out of the accumulated losses of National Carriers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is, of course, largely centred around the implications of all this for the taxpayer, and on whether, with the various provisions that we propose we are doing justice to the public purse and the public interest. The matter was best described by the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) as a hybrid operation. It is a most unusual task of turning a statutory corporation into a Companies Act company. We are concerned with the formation of the new company. We are concerned with the opening balance sheet of the new company that will be created on the appointed day when the Minister becomes the sole owner of the capital that he creates, and with the capital structure that he decides to create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not immediately concerned with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0958">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1765</span>
the flotation, although, of course, it does have implications for the flotation thereafter, because the Minister has made quite clear that the Government's policy is to prepare for an eventual sale of all, or the greater part, of the shareholding in the new company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the various problems that arise at the moment the new Companies Act company is created and wholly owned by the Minister. We have to give the new company a balance sheet. We have to give it a capital structure. Various problems will arise because of the unusual nature of this emergence from a chrysalis of the new company out of the previous corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are hiding behind technicalities in the clause and the explanations that I am giving, it is by no means deliberate. The problem is that a whole series of technical difficulties are thrown up when we turn the statutory corporation into the Companies Act company. If they were not dealt with on the face of the Bill, it still would be necessary for someone to decide what are the various implications under the Finance Acts and the Companies Act for the new balance sheet of the new company arising out of this transaction. If left to the direct application of the Companies Act and the Finance Acts, some of the implications to the new company would be quite anomalous and inappropriate to the situation with which we are dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, I take the problem dealt with by subsection (4) of what to do with the pre-acquisition earnings. The earnings at the end of the financial year include part pre-acquisition earnings and part post-acquisition earnings, or reserves that represent accumulated earnings from the past. In the case of a take-over bid the arrangements would be that any previous earnings of that sort would not be available for distribution. The right hon. Gentleman then enlarged on another important aspect of the whole clause—that any difference between the value of the company and the nominal value of the issued capital would be placed into a share premium account and not available for distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 38 we seek to avoid the consequences because upon examination it is not appropriate to treat the transaction of creating a Companies Act company out of a corporation in the same way. The right hon. Gentleman said that it was quite
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1766</span>
wrong of us to avoid these consequences because in his opinion the protection against distribution of these normally undistributable moneys is for the shareholders of the first company. The right hon. Gentleman drew an analogy between the shareholders of the first company and the public who are the owners of the present NFC. With respect, it is not my understanding that that is the purpose of the Companies Act provisions. At present I do not see how the Companies Act and Finance Acts provisions with which we are concerned protect the shareholders of the first company that has sold out. The protection probably intended by the Companies Act is for any creditors of the first company, otherwise it would be possible for a company to pass from one set of hands into another set of hands and a whole lot of accumulated reserves or earnings to be distributed and vanish and for the creditors of the first company to find that the most readily available assets of the company that owes them money were being dissipated in the take-over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a situation one needs to guard against where a nationalised industry is being changed to a company wholly owned by a Minister representing the public interest. There is no question of assets being distributed in that way. The Minister will be the holder on behalf of the public of 100 per cent. of the capital of the new company. Insofar as any of the accumulated earnings are distributed, so long as he remains the 100 per cent. owner, dividends will go into the Consolidated Fund to the benefit of the taxpayer. There will come a stage when the Minister will cease to receive those dividends and put them into the Consolidated Fund, but that will be when he sells his shares. The potential value of moneys available for distribution together with the future earnings prospects of the company will be reflected in the price he receives for his shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to what appears to be at the root of the objections of hon. Gentlemen on the other side of the Committee, and was the root of the strong complaint of the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans). They are expressing an objection to the fact that one of the consequences of what we are doing, when one goes on to the flotation and sale, is to make these shares a more attractive proposition to investors. That is inescapable and I do not seek to deny that at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0959">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1767</span>
I have explained why the appropriate way for dealing with the balance sheet is in the way in which we are at the moment when the company is formed. Undoubtedly, it will have consequences when one goes on to flotation and one of the main consequences will be that potential investors will find the company more attractive if its earnings are not locked up as undistributable capital for no good reason. That is a consequence on which we are all agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where I disagree with hon. Gentlemen is that they seek to argue that somehow or other the taxpayer is badly treated. If we make the shares a more attractive, saleable proposition to investors, the better will be the price obtained for the public purse. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary does not write off tax in his legislation that he might otherwise have received regardless of the consequences to the public purse. Anything that is foregone by the Inland Revenue, for example, as a result of the treatment of tax losses that is proposed will be more than compensated for by the enhanced capital value of a public asset which will be a shareholding of the Minister. There is no question of a rip-off or the taxpayer losing for the benefit of investors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first purpose is that this is a sensible way of applying the law to this unusual situation, it happens to be a consequence that that makes the shares more attractive and saleable, and the main consequence is that the public will receive more money from the sale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to enter this highly technical area but a thought that keeps buzzing back to mind is that when one considers the taxpayers' position one has to judge that against the writing off of the liabilities. It is the taxpayers' money and if one writes off the liabilities, as we are doing in this case and as was done with £50 million in 1978 under the previous Administration, in the judgment of the Parliamentary Secretary will that be more or less than the amount of money likely to be obtained from the transactions in shares?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is right in drawing an analogy with our past debates about what he
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1768</span>
described as the writing-off of the liabilities. He is either talking about the present fixed-interest debt to the Government or the pensions liabilities referred to in the debate. There is a difference of view between us, but I believe that it is a philosophical difference on how we are interpreting totally technical changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the point of view of the taxpayer, all we are doing in setting up the new capital structure is getting rid of all the fixed-interest liabilities to the Government and putting in its place marketable shareholdings which the Government will hold instead. The pensions liabilities are at present real liabilities to the public as owners of the corporation. There is an unfunded part of the pension fund that is a present liability so far as the public as owners of the corporation are concerned and a genuine reduction in the capital value of the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It happens that the flotation will be more successful without any loss to the taxpayer if the first charge on the proceeds is to get rid of that unfunded pensions liability so that we can hand on a company that does not have that millstone round its neck. The liability is there to be discharged by somebody, in any case, and, again, it is purely an interpretation of a technical decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has made a beautiful case but unfortunately he has only included in the formula the little piece that suits his case. If he is saying, on the one hand, that for road services £8.8 million is available, and, on the other hand, that he is giving away £100 million and that the price will be greater for the taxpayer, surely, in all honesty, he must take account of the public money put in to make that £8.8 million a profit. That is what is turned round, so that we are not talking about £100 million but about a total, and, when one adds the total, what price are the shares to be to give back that money to the taxpayer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Parliamentary Secretary tell the Committee how the shares are to be floated? Are they to be floated just as NFC or are they to be floated as shares of each subsidiary? That is most germane to the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would advise the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central, who is concerned about the taxpayer receiving fair treatment in the disposing of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0960">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1769</span>
a public asset, to come to a clear conclusion about exactly what the public hold at present and what is being disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had this argument in previous debates. It is not an accurate guide to the public's present interest for us to start going into the size of the fixed-interest debt that the corporation owes, nor is it appropriate to look, back to the history of grants made to it, which is money long since gone and forgotten. At present the public have the assets of the National Freight Corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation has a certain asset value, subject to certain liabilities such as that of its unfunded pensions obligations. That is what we shall sell for the best price available. The present value of those assets and the price that we shall secure will not be affected by the nominal £100 million of fixed-interest debt that exists, or by any of the other considerations that are being brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By getting over the technical and tax complications and making the structure straightforward and the opening balance sheet sensible, we are ensuring that the eventual price will be fair to the taxpayer—that is, the best that can be achieved for the disposal of the shareholding. The exercise that we are engaged in—that is, the creation of a Companies Act company from a nationalised industry—throws up all sorts of technicalities. If we had not dealt with them they would still have existed in practice. The Bill attempts to deal with those technicalities in a straightforward way, to produce a sensible balance sheet and a logical distinction between capital on the one hand and distributable profits and reserves on the other, among other purposes to make the shares eventually a more saleable and attractive proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a consistency throughout our proposals with what my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary is doing. We are trying to avoid unnecessary technical consequences that would come from the application of other parts of the law which were really designed for different circumstances, and to create—I accept that this is something of a fiction, but it is one that is on the face of the Bill—a position as though the National Freight Corporation had always been a private company which was run prudently, accounted properly and had its balance sheet in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as possible we have tried to avoid the complications that may be thrown up by the nature of the transaction in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1770</span>
which we are engaged and to create-circumstances that would be fair to shareholders and everybody else, with a balance sheet that would have applied if NFC had always been a Companies Act company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we can implore the implications of the clause much further. I suggest that the interpretation being put on the clause by the Opposition is both political and ill-founded. We share a common interest—that of the taxpayer. We shall protect that interest by producing a marketable company and achieving the best price for the benefit of the public purse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Parliamentary Secretary was coming close to creating a certain measure of agreement between the two sides of the Committee. In view of that, it is a pity that he should round off his case by saying that the construction which the Opposition are putting on the clause is political and ill-founded. He was being more emollient when he suggested that there may be a difference of philosophy in our approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the Government are putting a political construction on the clause, and that that flows from a number of other matters in the Bill. We certainly do not agree with the judgment that leads them to their conclusions, and that may be from a difference of philosophy. I would not argue about that. But, thanks to the Parliamentary Secretary's contribution, at least we start at one point of agreement. Simply, if the NFC is sold, with a dividend available for immediate distribution and there is a nominal value on the shares, it is likely that they will fetch more than if that dividend were not paid, or if it were done in a restricted form—that is, distributed only in a very limited way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, the same would be true if one private company were being sold to another at a certain nominal value. If a dividend were transferred and made available for immediate distribution, the second company would have to pay a greater price for the shares if the other were set at a nominal value. But the Companies Act prevents that being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we come to the first point of difference between us. Why should different criteria be applied in selling off a public asset? The Parliamentary Secretary said—and I am loth to have a duel with him on the matter—that the purpose of the Com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0961">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1771</span>
panies Act in preventing a dividend's being immediately distributed on being transferred from one company to another is to protect the creditors of the first company. Presumably, that means they would receive that protection if they had to pursue the second company for any money owed them by the first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be one of the purposes, but it is not necessarily the sole one. The House may have had something else in mind by putting that provision into the companies legislation. For example, if a decision were taken by those in control of company A to sell it to company B at a price well below its true value, and that Companies Act provision did not exist and company B were able immediately to distribute the dividend, there would be little likelihood of redress being available either for the original shareholders of company A whose shares may have been sold at a price over which they had no control—that would depend on the company's construction—or for the creditors. In fact, those owed money by company A might do rather better by pursuing their claim against company B than those original shareholders in company A who disagreed with the decision to sell, which may have been against their wishes or over their heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that that is as far as the analogy can be taken. I do not believe that the matter is fundamental to the argument between us, which is how the public interest will be best protected in the event of the corporation's being sold. We make no bones about the fact that we do not want the corporation sold. However, we are trying to ensure that if it is the will of the House that that happens, at least it will be done in circumstances under which the public interest is protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear option, about which not a word has yet been said. The dividend should simply be paid into the consolidated fund on the day of nomination—that is, the transfer to the successor company. There would then be no arguing that the public had received that dividend, which had been acquired on public capital. The Government could have put that into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have not chosen to do so. The argument that the Parliamentary Secretary seems to have advanced is that there is an advantage to the public in transferring that dividend, which would be available
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1772</span>
for immediate distribution, because the public would receive more for the shares in that way. That is a matter of conjecture and judgment. We do not know at this stage whether the extra amount received will be equal to the value of the dividend, but at least we should be entitled to exercise our judgment and express our considerable doubts on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With no idea of the financial construction the Opposition are entitled to say that the way in which we should judge the matter and reach some conclusion about whether the public will be better served is by having regard to how these are served now. That is a fixed payment of about £8 million per year in return for the debt and loan of NFC. We do not know what the public will get from the sale of the shares in this form, but we know that somebody will be put in a position to buy NFC with a unique advantage. It will be possible for the company to be bought in a form in which no private company could be bought because it would not be possible to get hold of dividends for immediate distribution in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can see the Parliamentary Secretary's argument. This is a way of giving the Minister even more power to determine the capital structure. If I may say so without being patronising, the Parliamentary Secretary put it extremely well. He said that this will give the Minister control not just over the capital structure but over the balance sheet of the company on the first day that it exists. I agree with him. That is exactly what it will do. If we let the clause go through in this form, the Minister will have the power to say that the balance sheet of the successor company on its first day of existence will contain dividends which were created not by the successor company but by the corporation and which should belong to the public. Those assets will belong to the public on that day in the form of the Minister's holding and the holdings of his nominees which are still within his control because he will control his nominees at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition do not regard it as reasonable for that unique advantage to be conferred upon one group of citizens, namely, those in a position to buy shares in the successor company. Company law expressly forbids such a situation on the transfer of one private company to another, for reasons which the House found

valid. Yet we are asked to set that consideration aside when a public asset is being sold off. No Conservative Government would ask us to set it aside if one private company were being sold off to another. But when it is a public asset, they say that it is a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is indeed a different matter, and there may indeed be a difference of political philosophy. We therefore seek to exercise our own judgment, based upon our own philosophy. The Opposition believe that the public should have no less protection when an asset is held in their public name than when it is held in their private names. We cannot split our citizens in that way. We do not believe that they are a schizophrenic bunch who wish to be treated in one way when the asset is held in common with all other citizens and in another way when it is held in common with a limited number of other citizens, as in the case of a private company.
No case at all has been made out for treating them in this separate way here. Yet that is what we are being asked to accept. I take the Parliamentary Secretary's correction and withdraw the phrase "conjuring trick". We are being asked to</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debates on the clause so far have been instructive to many of us, although a considerable amount of concern and doubt remains. I shall not reiterate the many technical arguments. Indeed, it would be presumptuous to say that I fully understood all of them. Nevertheless, more information has become available through the Parliamentary Secretary's replies, leading us to take further advice on those aspects, to which we may return on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary has said that transforming a nationalised company in this way is in a sense a hybrid form of</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1774</span>
	<p>accept a fictional concept of the dividends. We are being asked to accept a fiction which puts at risk a part of what is unquestionably the public's own assets and rights, namely, the dividends.</p>
	<p>If those dividends were paid to the consolidated fund on the appointed day, there would be no doubt about what the public were getting back. The public would be getting exactly the dividends that the corporation has earned. But if the dividends are available for sale in the way proposed in the Bill, there is a doubt. We do not know how much the public will get back. It may be more, it may be less. It will depend upon what the shares bring on the market. It will depend upon how the nominal value corresponds to the true value of the company and how that influences the sale.</p>
	<p>The Government's proposal is an untenable proposition because it gambles with what the public have a right to expect with something that has been earned on a public asset operating in a free and open competitive market.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>treatment. He has made it clear that the reason for this proposal is the number of technical disadvantages or problems which arise from following a unique procedure for transferring a nationalised corporation to the private sector, involving also a period during which it will be a Companies Act company but without shareholders in the sense of shares being sold on the market The matter is further complicated by the implications of this and other clauses concerning the selling of the shares, what proportion is to be sold, the kind of price, the value to be reflected and other technical matters of that kind which have concerned us over the past two or three sittings.</p>
	<p>I shall address myself to just a couple of points in this debate. They were mentioned on the amendment to delete subsection (4), but some aspects were not entirely
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1775</span>
relevant to raise in that debate. I think that it would be valuable to explore a little further one of the Parliamentary Secretary's previous replies in the Committee with regard to tax loss and also the argument deployed about the taxpayer's interest.</p>
	<p>On the question of the taxpayer's interest, there is clearly a difference between us. The Parliamentary Secretary made a fair point when he argued that the interests of the taxpayer—presently reflected in the Government's investment in the company through the capital commencement debt and the loans and interest rates on the loans—would be fairly recoverable through a share issue if the price is right. We are concerned about how one achieves the best possible conditions to make the company an attractive proposition.</p>
	<p>Let us assume for the sake of the argument that there is agreement as to procedures, although clearly there is not at the moment, and about the best possible advantageous position to be reached in order to make the company as attractive as possible to the private market. Provided that a sufficient amount of money were raised—equivalent to the commencement debt and the interest payments from loans to the company—one could say that the taxpayer had been treated fairly. Taxpayers would merely have withdrawn from control of the company. They would not have lost their financial investment in the company as shareholders, through the Government, of a nationalised industry.</p>
	<p>That argument does not take our objections fully into account on the question of grants. It may be said that every company receives grants. Not only public sector companies but more and more private companies receive them. We know only too well that the private sector receives a considerable amount of money. Therefore I am not sure if I have grasped the situation perfectly clearly. However, if the Parliamentary Secretary will allow me to deploy my argument now, he will be able to give his reaction later.</p>
	<p>When the NFC was set up in 1968 some financial reconstruction took place. National Carriers, a company that has been mentioned by my hon. Friends and by the Parliamentary Secretary, was the problem child of the consortium. It was thought that the grouping together of companies would make cross-subsidisation possible. It would be possible to make
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1776</span>
profits with certain companies, such as BRS and others that have been mentioned by my hon. Friends. But it was never in doubt—the Select Committee examining the matter was clear about that—that National Carriers was a real problem. Losses were to be envisaged for a number of reasons, such as outdated equipment and buildings. All manner of problems were associated with the company. It is not necessary for us to debate that here, as there will be general agreement about the problems at that time.</p>
	<p>The Government came to the conclusion in 1968 that if the NFC were to take on National Carriers and still be able to observe its commercial obligations as a nationalised industry it would be fair to acknowledge that it would not be possible to make a profit with the company for so many years. They therefore agreed to make certain grants. Refreshing my memory from the Select Committee report on the NFC, I think that the Committee envisaged that National Carriers alone would require over a five-year period annual deficit grants adding up to a total of £60 million. In fact something like £47 million was actually claimed.</p>
	<p>During the 1978 financial reconstruction again there was an agreement for grants of something like £15 million to be made. Those grants are distinct from the commencement debt and from capital loans given by the Government. Those are the two aspects of liability with which the Bill is concerned. We are writing off the commencement debt of the company and the loan liabilities. It is a fair argument that those can be transferred over into the value of the shares. Let us assume for the purposes of this argument that they are cancelled out.</p>
	<p>However, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to accept that grants by the Government—that is, by the taxpayer—are an investment by the taxpayer in the company. Direct grants without conditions were given solely because of a belief that if the grants were there to tide the organisation over a particularly bad time that should be sufficient, given good management and good labour relations, to turn the company round.</p>
	<p>It is agreed that the company has now been turned round. The evidence for that is reasonably clear. It is a matter for congratulations to the management and labour in the industry. I am trying to stress the point that those grants of up to £60 million
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0964">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1777</span>
were an investment by the taxpayer. But that liability is not dealt with by the Bill. The grants were freely given, so no liability attaches to the successor company or, indeed, to the present National Freight Corporation.</p>
	<p>The Opposition argue that the taxpayers have thereby directly lost their investment. Taxpayers turned the company round into a potentially good company that will bring future profits. Undoubtedly that will be reflected in the price that the Government will obtain. It is much easier now to sell the problem company as a relative success—it is certainly far more of a success than it was a number of years ago. The turn-round has been remarkable. The Government proposals mean a total loss for the taxpayer, both of cash and of potential earnings.</p>
	<p>I suppose we shal have to agree that that is a matter of judgment. It is not a mere matter of interpretation but a political difference between the judgments arrived at by the two parties. However, I do not think that we could readily accept the Parliamentary Secretary's contention that the value of loans and of the commencement debt, let alone of the investments, could be recouped simply in the price of the shares.</p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>The taxpayer has to accept that nearly £60 million—perhaps more than that—will be lost. I remember the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) emphasising how much money had been given in grants to the NFC. The loans with which we are concerned here do not represent the total amount of money that the taxpayer has put into the company.</p>
	<p>Although it can be argued that such grants, like those made to private industry, must be looked upon as dead loss, we are concerned here with a publicly-owned asset. Having helped the corporation to turn round in 10 years, the public should now be able to look forward to reaping the advantage from the money that they have given not only in loans but also in grants. There is a clear distinction.</p>
	<p>The only further point I wish to make concerns the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to the question asked by the hon. Member for Faversham about tax losses. First, I express surprise but also appreciation that the Parliamentary Secretary has passed over his notes. I have attempted to read and understand them.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1778</span>
	<p>I am not sure that I have succeeded and would like to listen to the advice of those who know more about the subject. However, it is certainly helpful to have read the notes. This matter has been pursued by a number of hon. Members and we have been awaiting the Government's reply. Perhaps it might have been even more helpful to receive the notes before the sitting began.</p>
	<p>The point is fairly made by the Parliamentary Secretary that even the Ministry of Transport was not aware of what the Treasury said in January. That is a little unfortunate since the Bill is full of references to Treasury consent. One can only hope that in future the Treasury will inform the Ministry of Transport about matters pertinent to the Bill and presumably to other legislation presently dealing with denationalisation.</p>
	<p>We shall be able to return to the issue with a fuller understanding at Report stage. It is a pity that the hon. Member for Faversham is not here, since he first raised the matter. I do not know whether he knew that a reply was to be made today. His absence is unfortunate as we might otherwise have had the benefit of his original inquiry by which the matter was first raised in the Committee.</p>
	<p>I shall return to the tax situation as I understand it. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can help us to agree, or at least tell me how correct my interpretation is. The problem is clear from his own notes. We are concerned here about the loans and capital liabilities specifically mentioned in the Bill. We are aware that in clause 36(4) they are written down directly. That is straightforward. There can be no argument about further legislation. The measure is contained in the Bill before us.</p>
	<p>The argument that arises is whether the accumulated tax losses will be considered as a tax advantage. I presume that tax "disadvantage" here really means tax advantage for a profitable company wishing to buy into NFC against whose tax loss position it could offset its own profitable position. That is a common financial manoeuvre, particularly in the shipping world, in which I am more closely interested. That which the Parliamentary Secretary calls a tax disadvantage is seen by the Opposition as a tax advantage for the benefit of a profitable company that may be considering the value of purchasing control—major shares, or whatever they are called—in the company.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0965">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1779</span>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary really confirmed my understanding of the Treasury's meaning when he said that the principle is to treat the NFC for those purposes as if it had been a private company before. If losses occurred before the company was sold, those losses would accrue to the successor company. Therefore, a retrospective advantage is again being given to the company that may buy the shares in the National Freight Corporation, though the Minister and the Treasury may see it as a disadvantage.</p>
	<p>We are thus giving to a potential purchaser, who may be a profitable company, the possibility of offsetting profits against accumulated tax losses over the period for which it is possible to claim under tax legislation. It may be four or five years, I am not sure. Presumably there is a limit on the period for which one can claim back accumulated tax losses. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can tell us what it is, although that may be rather short notice for the question.</p>
	<p>It would be interesting to know, since this company has been in difficulty about its tax losses since it was established. It has improved its position, but because of National Carriers, and because it has been given grants, there is a huge tax loss going right back to 1968 which normally would not have occurred because any company incurring losses over that period would have been out of business. However the State was prepared to give grants over that period. So the taxpayer loses the grants given, and it is now suggested that not the taxpayer but the purchaser will have the advantages of the tax losses which have been maintained primarily because of the grants.</p>
	<p>That is clearly another major bonus in the procedure provided by the clause. The clause is designed, as the Minister has said, to prevent moneys held as reserves of the company from being redistributable.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that what we need to know from the Parliamentary Secretary is how much tax relief is being sold as an asset of NFC? In other words, when the successor company purchases NFC, is it buying relief from future taxation? We want to know how far that will affect the price that the public receive for their asset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the kind of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1780</span>
arithmetical deduction one would have to make. I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind the amount of accumulated losses, but it is certainly an asset that is being sold. Presumably the Parliamentary Secretary will say that the shares will be all the better for that, provided that these are still profitable companies in Britain wishing to make the claim. It is increasingly difficult to identify such companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have to return to the matter of tax. The main point of this and similar Bills is to make nationalised industries—freight, aerospace and civil aviation—attractive to the private market. The provisions of the clause are a very substantial plus in making the company attractive. What grieves most of us is that it is remarkable how all sorts of new rules and regulations and departures from procedures and existing Company Law are brought in, in order to make a nationalised industry a financially attractive prospect when it is to become a private company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All sorts of penalties have been imposed—admittedly, by both Governments—on nationalised industries in terms of financial obligations, but they are being treated differently when being returned to the private market. Presumably we are to be taught a political lesson: "See how attractive the company has become, now that it is private!" Under the terms and conditions being laid down, it seems difficult not to make this company more profitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to pursue only one point. It is, in part, a development of the argument advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it fiction or truth that the public gain if they get more for their holding in NFC because they are selling tax losses or future tax relief? I ask that simply because of the argument, which has been made by successive Conservative Ministers, that if some people are able to avoid their tax liability, they throw the burden upon others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If in the Bill we are to sanction the sale of tax losses or tax relief, do we, by enabling those shares to be sold for more, ensure that the public receive money in one way only by ensuring that they lose it in another? If tax losses cannot be passed on, the earnings of the successor company, which would then be liable for tax, will contribute to the general funds coming in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0966">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1781</span>
to the Treasury to pay for goods and services out of public funds, and thereby reduce general taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not develop the point. Perhaps one of my hon. Friends will want to talk about the effect on money supply. I wish to remain with my narrow argument which it seems fair to put to a Minister of a Government who have declared, first, that they want to bring down the general burden of taxation, and second, that a device which enables people to avoid a tax liability merely throws a burden on others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Parliamentary Secretary advise us of the Government's thinking on the matter? Are they proposing to sell a tax loss, a means by which somebody will not have to pay tax in the future, in other words, a hunk of tax relief? Will the Government explain how that can be to the advantage of the public as holders of NFC, if they then have to pay tax in another way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be as brief as possible. My contribution is severely reduced by the limit of my understanding of the whole issue. Therefore, I shall have to talk in simple terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the Parliamentary Secretary justifies clause 38 on the grounds that it will put the new company in the position it would have been in, had the National Freight Corporation been a company under the Companies Act. But that is not entirely true. There are a number of points I should like to raise because such a transaction is not entirely on all fours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assuming, for a moment, that the National Freight Corporation were a Companies Act company, and had an under-funded pension scheme, would not that company's assets need to be used to make up the under-funding before the transfer took place? If that is so, the first call on either those assets or the funds of the new company would be to provide the necessary funding for the pension scheme. It seems to me that that is the case. The Government are therefore putting the transaction on all fours with a move from a Companies Act company to another Companies Act company only in those cases where the transaction will be to the advantage of the new shareholders in the new company. Where it would be to the advantage of the people who worked in he industry and would receive a pension,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1782</span>
and their dependants, they will not. That is a ludicrous scheme of priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next question to which no answer appears to have been given concerns the value of the tax losses of the existing National Freight Corporation. I use "value" in the sense of an asset for prospective purchasers of shares in the new company. As I understand it, that information will be available as necessary before the Minister can sell the shares. If there is under-funding of the pension scheme after the Minister has made his contribution, a note will have to be made on the prospectus by the trustees of the pension scheme or their actuary saying to what extent the scheme is underfunded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also likely to be a requirement of an indication or note on the prospectus from the Inland Revenue of the extent of the tax losses which may be an asset to the new purchasers. So any question of the sale of the NFC being made before the legislation mentioned by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in his answer in January was operative would seem to be unworkable, otherwise the Minister would be in the position where he and the merchant bankers advising him were putting onto the market shares in a company the value of which at that point was incapable of being properly assessed or calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee are being put into the strange position of making arrangements to attempt to protect the interests of the public and the taxpayer when we have no idea of the scale of tax losses which can be regarded as an asset by profitable purchasers. In such circumstances, we cannot possibly support these transitional provisions, which are intended to deal with the opening balance sheet of the new company, because we—and even the learned officials advising the Minister—will not know what the opening balance sheet represents. If they came up with an alleged opening balance sheet without knowing the tax proposals in the measures the Financial Secretary announced in January, they would be attempting to sell the assets on the basis of a false prospectus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Above all, I should like to know the scale of the tax losses that will be such an asset to a profitable company—and there are such profitable companies. I say that with great respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0967">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1783</span>
(Mr. Prescott) [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Well, there are profitable property companies spilling around. Quite a few of them managed to survive their unseemly collapse in 1973–74. Many Labour Members are extremely concerned about the likely intentions of the property companies to move into this area for asset stripping purposes. They are exactly the types who are interested in the real estate that will go with the National Freight Company and who have been playing off tax losses. They are expert at it and the old tax losses concept is something that they have exploited to the Nth degree over the years. This seems to be yet another incitement to this kind of scum—for that is what they are—to move into this sphere and threaten the jobs of the people who have worked hard and loyally for the NFC over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still feel that the Committee is in constant danger of confusing itself about the true nature of the clause and failing to keep its collective eye on the ball in respect of the purpose, as far as what clause 38 is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are consistently concerned about what is to happen on the sale of the company. That is hardly surprising because the main policy objective of part II of the Bill is to prepare the company for sale. We are now taking part in the stand part debate on a highly technical clause, described as providing transitional provisions with respect to reserves and so on. The transition with which we are concerned is the transition from a statutory corporation to a Companies Act company on the appointed day. That is when the Minister sets up a company of which he is the 100 per cent, owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 38—I realise that I repeat myself but this is the main point of the clause—is concerned with giving that new company, at the point where it is 100 per cent. owned by the Minister, a sensible balance sheet. Although it is perfectly fair to continue to project what the consequences of that balance sheet for sale will be, most of out arguments have become bogged down in the technicalities of the balance sheet as if we were dealing with the moment of sale, which we are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequences of applying, without clause 38, the provisions of the Companies and Finance Acts to the new balance sheet would be to give the company, at the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1784</span>
moment of its formation, a rather nonsensical balance sheet that would not reflect the position which would have pertained had it been a continuously trading Companies Act company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have all confused ourselves by going into what happens with private takeovers and so on. Subsection (4) which was dealt with by the last amendment we discussed, is concerned with the transfer of shares. That means the transfer of shares which the NFC now owns in the trading subsidiaries. Those shares will be transferred so that they are owned by the new Companies Act company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and I began comparing the exemption from section 56 of the Companies Act 1958, and the fact that accumulated profits will not have to go into a share premium account, with the arrangements under subsection (2) relating to takeovers. But in subsection (2) we are concerned with the issue, not the transfer of the shares. Section 56 deals with the problem of the issuing of the shares in a way that is not appropriate to the most unusual circumstances in which the issue of shares is by a Minister in a new Companies Act company being created by him which previously he owned. That is the content and purpose of clause 38.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not seek to avoid the other questions. On that highly technical, but very flimsy, base the Opposition keep constructing these various speculations and questions about what happens when we get to the sale, so I will move on to that and deal with tax losses, which do not arise under the clause anyway. They are suddenly being regarded by the Opposition as a vastly important asset which will somehow be carried forward to new purchasers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tax losses made in the past by the National Freight Corporation and, more importantly, its trading subsidiaries, amount in the 1978 accounts to a total of £45 million. I am sorry that I give answers to hon. Members questions when, momentarily, they are not in the room. I have been doing that all morning. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) was not here when I answered his question. The answer is that they were £45 million in the 1978 accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked one of my colleagues whether the figure had been given, and he said that it had not. I apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the answer that I gave did not stand out like a shining light in the midst of the technical problems before us, but that was the value of the latest published accounts that I have with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tax losses made by the subsidiaries—principally National Carriers, for the reasons correctly described by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East—are available to be set off only against future trading profits of the same business. There is therefore no way in which another company can buy the controlling interest in the national freight company and somehow use National Carriers' past tax losses as an offset against the purchasing company's future profits. The accumulated tax losses being carried forward in the accounts of the corporation and its subsidiaries have only contingent value in that they can be set off for tax purposes in the future against profits made by the same business. I therefore do not feel that they are available to some unscrupulous outside purchaser in the way that has been suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the specific question asked by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East about the nature of the tax losses, there is no limit to the period of time within which the business that made the losses may carry them forward in its accounts in order potentially to be able to set them off against its tax liability on future profits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the matter that the Parliamentary Secretary has just explained, if a company buys 15 per cent, of the shares the position will obviously be different from one of total ownership. In the shipping industry, of which I have more experience, I was always under the impression that one company would buy another for just that purpose. This may be different, but I always understood that one company buying into another for the tax losses outstanding was a common financial operation. However, I accept what the Parliamentary Secretary says, that that does not apply in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to give a responsible reply, I should have to take advice rather than give an off-the-cuff lay answer. No doubt circumstances arise in which businesses are merged in some way and in which the losses carried forward by one company are of great value to the resulting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1786</span>
merger. But one cannot do that simply by buying some of the shares that the Minister puts on the market in this case. The tax losses on the books of National Carriers would be of value only in the sense that if trading profits are made in the future by National Carriers those tax losses can be set off against its tax liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South made a number of points about the pensions consequences of the deficiency. I will deal with that matter only briefly, by way of preliminary information to help in our debate on clause 40, where most of the points more properly arise. The hon. Gentleman believes that the Bill in some subtle way deals with the matter of the unfunded pension liability in a different manner from that which would apply if it were a straightforward sale of a private sector company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first answer to that is that I find it difficult to imagine a successful sale of a private sector company with an unfunded pensions liability of some £30 million to £40 million. That would be an extremely unusual situation and an actuary's nightmare. Certainly, it would not make it an attractive proposition for sale. Nevertheless, companies are sometimes sold, on an up-to-date actuarial assessment, with some unfunded deficiency in their pension funds. In seeking to sell a company that has an unfunded pensions obligation, it is open to the owner to make the unfunded portion of the pensions obligation the first call on the proceeds of the sale. That would be a very prudent way of disposing of a private sector company with an unfunded pensions liability. All we are doing in clause 40 is giving the Minister the power to do what a private seller would be able to do in any event and what, in that rather bizarre situation, he would be likely to do so as to sell his company in a sensible way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the avoidance of doubt perhaps I should just point out that I said £30 million to £40 million was the unfunded road pensions obligation. It is that to which we propose to devote the proceeds of sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move onto the main burden of the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), who feels strongly about the past grants made to the company by the taxpayer. He seems to think that somehow the taxpayer should be guaranteed to recover that money on the corporation's eventual sale. However, I do not believe that that can be the position when grants are made to any trading company. Clearly, we cannot enlarge the debate into a general discussion about Industry Act grants and those to outside industries. It is in the nature of a grant—as opposed to a loan—that it is a contribution of taxpayers' money made to a trading company because, for political or social reasons, the Government judge it right and in the public interest for it to continue its trade, when otherwise it might not be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not arguable that somehow a grant carries with it a right to its recovery at some time in the future. Indeed, often when grants are made in a rescue attempt that goes wrong they are lost for ever. My</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1788</span>
	<p>reply remains the same as that which I gave in an earlier debate. We must examine what the public—the taxpayers—now have, which is the National Freight Corporation with its present asset value and trading position, past record and future prosperity. That is what the taxpayer has, and it must be sold for the best possible price.</p>
	<p>In the end, as the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) emphasised, there is a matter of judgment about whether more will be gained by distributing dividends to the consolidated fund or in enhancing the capital value of the shares that will be sold, about how and when we float them and about capital structure, and so on. I should like to make clear to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Cential (Mr. Cowans) that we shall not be selling the subsidiaries separately. There is no question of that. We shall sell the shares of the holding company, so to speak—that is, National Freight.</p>
	<p>We have the joint aim of making sure that the taxpayer receives the best value possible from the assets that he now holds. That is best achieved by the sensible course of the share flotation of a Companies Act company, and that launched with a sensible balance sheet. That is what the clause seeks to achieve.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of clause 39 is to make sure that the NFC ceases to exist on the appointed day defined in the Bill. I want to use the debate to extract from the Minister an account of the jobs which will remain to be done for NFC if not by NFC, given that NFC disappears, following the appointed day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I have never had to wind up a company and, therefore, some of the more obvious aspects of the problem may have escaped me. I worked for two com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0970">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1789</span>
panies that had to be wound up, but that happened after I had left them. In saying that I am not trying to exempt myself from any fair apportionment of blame that might be attached to me for their having to be wound up. But I was not involved in winding them up so I do not know what that entailed. Certainly, I have not been involved in winding up a public corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems on a simple examination of the legislation that set up the NFC that a number of jobs must remain to be done. I question whether it is appropriate that the successor private company should be charged with the task of winding up a public corporation. After all, the successor private company will exist for a rather different purpose and we should have some explanation why the successor private company is being given these tasks, if I am right in assuming that there are tasks to be accomplished after the appointed day, in winding up the NFC. Undoubtedly what will remain to be done will be the production of final accounts. The Bill appears to make very specific provision for that, so I assume that when instructing those drafting the Bill the Minister took the view that it might be impossible for the corporation to wind up its accounts by the appointed day and that somebody would have to do that afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the clause, that task appears to fall to the successor company. Is that proper? Why should a successor company wind up the accounts of the preceding public corporation? Unquestionably, the successor company will have an interest in the accounts since it will be dealing with accounts of what will then be the assets of the private successor company. It has never seemed to have been generally accepted in British legal practice that because one has a financial interest in an asset one is best qualified to be dealing with that, particularly if one is dealing with that asset at the point when it is changing ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that it was a requirement of the Transport Act in dealing with the present regulations on the preparation of the NFC's accounts. If that is so, has the clause the effect of repealing that part of the Transport Act that now requires the accounts of NFC to be presented yearly? That is a fairly direct question, and if that is the case, why does the Minister take a power in the clause to direct the form of the final accounts? In other words, why
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1790</span>
should the final accounts be prepared in any way different from the annual accounts that have been prepared, under a provision made in a Finance Act, by the corporation, and presented to the House in a particular way each year? Would it not be better to have accounts produced in exactly the same form? That would enable Members of Parliament to compare NFC's performance in its last year and compare it directly with its performance in previous years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this clause the successor company also appears to have the duty of appointing auditors for the public corporation that preceded it. Again, that is a strange provision. Why should the successor company have that responsibility? Why should not the auditors appointed by the NFC have that final task?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister directs that the accounts be prepared in a way different from those which have been prepared in the past, will he lay them before Parliament with some explanation of the way in which they are different, and with the instructions he has given? If we are to get a different set of accounts we should know why they are different, and what instructions have been placed on the successor company in preparing the accounts of its predecessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a strange provision which requires an explanation before we can decide whether the clause should stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is a tidying up formality. Once the creation of the new Companies Act company on the appointed day has taken place the NFC survives merely as a shell. It is most convenient to provide, as in subsection (1), that it should cease to exist on the appointed day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various matters will have to be sorted out. The only one of significance and the only one dealt with in the clause is the preparation of the final accounts. It is right that the NFC final accounts to the moment of its transfer to the successor company should be presented to the public in the usual way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will not be possible for the NFC to produce the accounts on or shortly after the appointed day. As is usual with any company accounts the full information is not immediately available, and not until some time later can the proper accounts be prepared. The successor company will be in the best position to produce accounts, because it will have all the information it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0971">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1791</span>
has taken from its predecessor and will continue to receive the flow of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present accounting procedures of the NFC are covered by section 24 of the Transport Act 1962, which was applied to the NFC by section 3 of the 1968 Act. That statutory duty is repealed in schedule 9 of the Bill, because the NFC will cease to exist on the appointed day. But the successor company, which will begin by being a 100 per cent, publicly owned company, will be placed under a strict statutory duty to produce the accounts in a prescribed form by subsection (2) of the clause. Therefore, this Companies Act company, described as a private company by the right hon. Gentleman, will be laid under a serious statutory duty to produce proper accounts for the public sector activities of its predecessor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) gives the Minister power to direct the form and particulars of the accounts and the right hon. Gentleman is concerned that for some reason the form of them might be changed by the Minister. I hope I can allay his fears by saying that would clearly be a bizarre action to take. As of now, is our expectation that the form of the accounts will be in an entirely similar form to those prepared by the NFC under its present statutory duty? The reason for taking this power to give some flexibility is that the period, for example, might be different from the 12-month period because these are the final accounts. It is certainly not intended to use the power to change completely the nature of the accounts on this final occasion. Indeed, such is the concern of Parliament and the Treasury for public accountability for public funds that there is no way in which the full accounts will not be available. The Minister will give directions with the approval of the Treasury, and the Treasury will be anxious to make sure that the accounts are produced in such a way that the corporation and those who ran it are fully accountable, that the Public Accounts Committee is able to deal with the matter, and so on. There is no question of altering the basic form or the accessibility of the accounts to be produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the appointment of auditors, I think that the right hon. Gentleman has slightly misread the Bill. Subsection (4) provides that the auditors shall be appointed by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1792</span>
Minister. It then sets out the qualifications that those auditors must have. The company will not appoint the auditors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I have a devious mind. If the Minister appoints the auditors for the new company—which seems better than that the successor company should appoint them—would he have in mind the auditors of the National Freight Corporation? That would enable the accounts to be as the National Freight Corporation would have wanted them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's suggestion is eminently sensible, and the advice I am receiving is strongly to accept it. It would, therefore, be the intention—apart from unforeseen circumstances—that the auditors would be those who dealt with the National Freight Corporation in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is tidier that the National Freight Corporation shall cease to exist, but the provisions of clause 39 in no way seek to obscure, change or conceal the accounts. It is important that we have the accounts for that final period up to the day when the corporation is extinct. The best reassurance is that at subsection (5) places the Minister under a statutory duty to lay a copy of the statement and report before each House of Parliament. That underlines the intention to reproduce past practice under the statutory duty laid upon the Corporation. Given the policy of the Bill, it is a sensible way of dealing with the transitional problem. I hope that the Committee will approve of the clause providing for the dissolution and final accounts of the National Freight Corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
