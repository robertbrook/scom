	<p>sultations that we seek to oblige the Minister to undertake before he takes on the momentous task of his initial determination of what proportion of relevant pension obligations will not be funded. Clearly, that is an enormous task. I am sure that the Opposition will refer on later amendments to the enormity of making that adjudication.</p>
	<p>The objective of the first two amendments is to secure consultation with representatives of the employees and with the trustees or managers of the schemes before the initial determination is made. Amendment No. 330 relates to the second stage of the process of determining the shortfall in funding. That is the more important stage, because it is when the Minister either confirms or varies his original determination.</p>
	<p>It is imperative that there should be consultations at both stages of the process. That is why we are proposing the requirement that there should be consultations with all the bodies involved.</p>
	<p>It is worth referring to the existing arrangements—some statutory, some extra-statutory—that we feel are morally binding on the Minister in relation to consultation over the assessments and determinations. When the final funding under the 1974 Act was to take place, the trade unions were given to understand that the final assessment of funding debts for the purposes of the funding scheme which is</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1073">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1975</span>
	<p>being abandoned and replaced by pay-as-you-go would be made by BRB fund actuaries with the co-operation of the Government Actuary. The unions were satisfied that all parties involved—BRB and its actuaries, the Government Actuary and the trade unions—would have their say in the work of building up the final determination of the funding.</p>
	<p>We contend that the assessment or determination for pay-as-you-go purposes is more important and more significant than the evalution for the old funding system. We think that it is more vulnerable to error in the sense that it is not capable of subsequent adjustment in the way that the old funding scheme would have allowed adjustment by those responsible for administering and investing the funds and deciding on the pace of their disbursement. As there was proper consultation with all concerned when the determination for a funding scheme was being made, it is all the more important for the proposed so-called pay-as-you-go scheme.</p>
	<p>In a sense, what is proposed is not a pay-as-you-go scheme. In a normal scheme what had to be paid out each year would be determined in the year concerned. In this case, the Minister is, in a sense, establishing a fund from which, if he has enough in it, he will be able to pay out on the pay-as-you-go scheme as the years go by. But the other parties to the process—those responsible for the current schemes and for the administration of both existing funds—will not be able to exercise any control over the Minister's side of the pay-as-you-go scheme. Consequently, there will not be the opportunity for flexibility, although we hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept later amendments to give a degree of flexibility.</p>
	<p>At present it seems that there will not be flexibility, and therefore there is a need for thorough consultation not only because people are interested, but because there is a great deal of expertise among the BRB fund's actuaries. Because the matter is so important the relevant trade unions may like a second opinion from other actuaries, and we feel that all those concerned have much to contribute to the process.</p>
	<p>For that reason, we should like to establish in the Bill a statutory obligation on the Minister to consult, and a statutory</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1976</span>
	<p>right for representatives of the staff and the management of the scheme to be consulted. That is the object of our amendments. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that it is in line with the commitment made by the Ministry of Transport in a letter to the British Railways Board on 7 December 1977. That letter stated that the Government's intention was that the basis of the valuation for funding purposes would be freely agreed by all parties involved—the Government, the board and the funds—on the basis of the actuarial advice available to them.</p>
	<p>We recognise that that was not a statutory obligation. The Government were not obliged under the 1974 Act to do that. But as that commitment was given for the purposes of carrying out the assessment before the fund was established we hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will feel bound by it. We hope that he will either accept our amendments or make other changes in the Bill in line with the spirit of the amendments.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I had not been convinced of the wisdom of amendment No. 327 before I started to study railway pensions for the purpose of debating the Bill I should certainly have been convinced after doing so. I can understand that the average railway or NFC trade unionist would wish to be satisfied that his or her trade union representative was at least consulted about the proposals to change the basis of Government support for historic pension rights and to make a proportion of the money dependent on funding already paid and the remainder dependent on pay-as-you-go calculations. That is all that our rather mild amendment seeks. It does not give those consulted any right to affect the outcome other than by their powers of persuasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has another advantage. The Minister has shown in the Committee that he is concerned to demonstrate the truth of his belief that the proposed changes will not worsen the pension schemes in so far as they are dependent on Government support. He has not convinced me of that, and I do not believe that he has convinced many of my hon. Friends either, but it is only fair that he should have the opportunity to convince the representatives of those who as members of the scheme and pensioners are most directly affected. For that reason it would highly desirable if representatives
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1977</span>
of the employees of BR and the NFC were included among those to be consulted before the determination is made. The amendment uses the traditional wording with regard to trade union representatives, but the meaning is clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With amendment No. 328 we may be pushing an open door. The Minister said on Tuesday evening that he accepts that it would be desirable, before the proportion is determined, to consult the management committee of the funds or, in the case of the NFC pension scheme, the trustees. He has accepted that it would be desirable for the final proportion determined to be agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads us on to the last amendment in the group, No. 330. I hope that it will be carried, but that it will not have to be used. I hope that the procedure in amendment No. 328 for consulting trustees will mean that the proportions determined have been agreed as fair. If it has to be done in this way, despite all my reservations, it is still better that the proportion should be agreed between the Minister and the trustees than that there should be a disagreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a disagreement—and the Parliamentary Secretary certainly envisaged the possibility when he said on Second Reading that in the event of disagreement the Minister must have the right to settle the issue—a special responsibility falls on the trustees of the fund. Particularly in the case of the NFC trustees, it has an effect on the sale of the public asset. If the trustees believe that the amount of the funding is insufficient to bear the proportion of the historic pensions costs that the Minister says that it will, they may take the view that they have a duty to make that clear to those buying the assets and liabilities of the NFC successor company. It therefore has a precise legal effect as well as being related to the realities of the situation. Given that the trustees have a responsibility in law, they should at least have the certainty that they will be notified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say all that believing it to be necessary as a fall-back in the event of disagreement, if the proportion that the Minister has stated should be borne by the funding is too high in the view of the trustees or of the British Railways pension board. I hope that that will not occur and that the proportion will be agreed. Nevertheless,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1978</span>
debating the Bill as it stands rather than as it will be if the next major amendment is passed, when most of this trouble will evaporate, it is important to press the issue at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport 	<div class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any difference of principle between us. Certainly, it is our intention that in determining the unfunded proportion of each scheme there will be close consultation between the Minister, advised by the Government Actuary, and the management of the scheme, advised by their own actuary, in the hope that agreement can be reached before determinations are made. My right hon. Friend the Minister gave an undertaking to the Committee on Tuesday that, in order to make that clear, we are prepared to write into the Bill at the appropriate point—and this is certainly the appropriate clause—a statutory duty to consult before making the final determination of the unfunded proportion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause divides the determination of the unfunded proportion into two stages. Subsection 1(	<i>a</i>) deals with a first determination which has to be made:
	<br><q><p>"as soon as practicable after the passing of this Act".</p></q>
The intention is that that will be a quick, fairly rough and ready determination—although I trust that actuaries are not too rough and ready in these matters—of the proportion, so that payments may begin straight away and will not have to wait for the full process of discussion, consultation and conclusion to be completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The snag with amendment No. 328, which bears most directly upon the duty to consult, is that it would apply to the first stage, as well as to the second stage provided for under subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) which requires the Minister within a set time to produce a final, formal determination of the unfunded proportion. That is subject to the approval of the House following the negative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend's undertaking on Tuesday was confined to the second stage, that of the final determination. That is not because he wishes to exclude the scheme or its managers from the first stage, but because it is essential that the first stage, the rough and ready determination,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1979</span>
should be accomplished as quickly as possible. It is in nobody's interests that anything should be written in which might cause delay which, in theory at any rate, could be the case with a statutory duty to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one included a statutory duty to consult before the rough and ready determination, it might mean that because somebody got difficult a longer period would pass before any determination could be made and that would lead to delays in payment. All would eventually be sorted out, in any event, by the end of the year when the formal determination takes place and, subject to the agreement of the Committee, we shall propose that the duty to consult should apply to the second stage only, although in practice there will obviously be some form of consultation throughout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Knowing your ruling and that of your fellow Chairman, Mr. Dean, I anticipate that I shall probably need the consent of the Committee before proceeding in that way but I have the draft of an amendment which I could submit in manuscript form. It would insert, on page 42, line 1—I would put it in there to make clear that the statutory duty to consult applies only to the second formal determination—the words:
	<br><q><p>"after consulting with the persons administering the scheme and the board or, as the case may be, the successor company."</p></q>
That would therefore insert a statutory duty to consult with the managers, the board or the successor company if we made lightning progress with the denationalisation of the NFC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hand that in, Mr. Dean, and perhaps you will accept it if it meets the general wish of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 327 tries to establish that there should also be a statutory duty to consult the trade union representatives of BR and the NFC. That is entirely understandable, for the reasons given by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), but I suggest that it is unnecessary, because the managements of the pension funds already contain large numbers of trade union representatives. I am not sure of the proportions, but I believe that they are roughly 50–50 on the management boards of all the pension schemes. For instance, Mr. Sidney Weighell and Mr. Ray Buckton are on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1980</span>
board dealing with the management of British Rail's pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A requirement to consult the managers of a fund would, in practice, involve making all the information available and consulting trade union and management representatives and pensions experts because they are all on the board. Therefore, it is probably not necessary to start widening the scope and making a separate duty to consult the trade unions because they would be fully involved with the consultation process anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, amendment No. 330 seeks to establish that, if by an unhappy chance some disagreement occurs, the managers of the fund should know the basis upon which the calculations had been made and the unfunded proportion arrived at. Again, I suggest that that is unnecessary, particularly when one looks at subsection (5). The Minister will direct the actuary to the scheme to make the actual calculations on which the final decision will be based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because in the end someone has to come to the final decision on the principles of that calculation, the Minister retains the sole statutory right to determine how those calculations shall be made. He will have to give instructions to the scheme's actuary to produce the necessary figures. Therefore, coupled with the consultations that have gone on before, there will be no question of the managers of the pension funds being left in ignorance or doubt about the basis upon which the Minister has made his determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by repeating that it is our hope that there will not be a dispute between the Government Actuary and others advising the Minister and those who advise the pension funds and the trade union representatives on the pension funds. The manuscript amendment that I propose adequately deals with the point about statutory consultation the other amendments seek to add a gloss, which in the light of that, is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be convenient for the Committee if I now indicate that I propose to select the manuscript amendment unless there is any objection to that in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Speaking for myself, Mr. Dean, and as far as I know, for my hon. Friends, there is no objection to the manuscript amendment. At the appropriate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1981</span>
time I shall seek to withdraw amendment No. 327, or ask my hon. Friend to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some questions arising from what the Parliamentary Secretary said. It would assist the Committee if he could inform us whether any payments will be made arising from the rough calculation, as he describes it, made under clause 45(1)(	<i>a</i>) prior to the confirmation of the final calculation in clause 45(l)(	<i>b</i>). If so, in what circumstances is it the general intention of this part of the Bill that the changeover in the type of funding would not normally take place when this process of funding and pay-as-you-go payments is completed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am far from happy about the Parliamentary Secretary's observations on our amendment No. 330. If the Minister is only going to say to an actuary responsible for the fund, "You do the calculation in this way" I am certain that that is as good as telling him what result to produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a very junior draughtsman when I first took a drawing—it was a drawing of a cast iron valve chest—to a senior draughtsman to be checked. He told me that the thickness of an intervening wall on the chest that I had drawn was wrong. I said that I had calculated it and that the Encastre flat plate formula produced a certain figure. He said that if the calculation produced the wrong figures I should change the calculation. He knew from his own experience that the figure was not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might have in his mind an appropriate figure. There is such a wide scope for changes of assumption and method in making the calculation as to enable the Minister to determine the figure. Therefore, it does not appear to matter much to the principle of what we are debating how the Minister conveys the instruction, but it is important that those who have the special responsibility should know what has been done. They can then formulate their views on whether it is the right way. If the Minister tells the actuary to calculate the figure in a certain way, and that he will stand by the proportion, the trustees of the NFC fund and the management Committee of the BR pension fund should know about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would also have the advantage that if they decided to make a statement on their own best calculation hon. Members would know before the order is laid before the House. I take great heart from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1982</span>
the Prime Minister's statement that the people of this country have voted for a Government who believe in the supremacy of Parliament. I disagree with most other statements of the Prime Minister, but I took great heart from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe in the supremacy of Parliament, too. That is why I am delighted that Parliamentary supremacy is brought in, albeit in a limited way, to the way in which these proportions are to be determined. I understand that an order is to be made by statutory instrument, as laid out in subsection (4), and that it will be laid before the House. If on the best information available, hon. Members feel that the Minister does not have it right they can pray against the order, we can have a debate on the matter and take a decision on whether to reject the order. That is the Parliamentary supremacy in which the Prime Minister and I believe and in which I hope Conservative Members believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The added advantage of amendment No. 330 is that people would unquestionably be better informed if the trustees knew the basis of the calculation and had the right to decide whether to make a statement that it confirmed their own calculations, or produced a situation that they contended would put at risk that part of historic pension rights dependent upon the funding element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little doubt that this is an important public finance issue. The mirror image of the proportion funded is the proportion unfunded. If the Minister issues an instruction to the actuary that results in his obtaining the wrong result—he may produce a figure of 20 per cent. when it should have been 30 per cent.—the difference would have to be handed over from public money. The public has a direct interest and should be represented. From what has been said up to now, the case for amendment No. 330 seems to be getting stronger rather than weaker, but I am grateful to the Minister for his manuscript amendment on subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Minister's point regarding trade union representation on the management Committee. He mentioned two of the unions concerned. I should like him to confirm that the TSSA is also to be represented, because it has considerable interest in pensions arrangements, and that the same arrangement will apply to

the NFC, because it has a trustee arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dealing with the last point first, I mentioned the names of the general secretaries of two of the railwaymen's unions, but, of course, the TSSA is just as interested in pensions. I do not know whether its general secretary is on the management committee, but it does have representatives on the committee. Similarly, the NFC has full representation for those unions the bargaining rights of which it recognises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the right hon. Member's other questions, it is the intention that after the first rough and ready determination—I use a lay description—is made under subsection (1), payments will begin straight away. That is the purpose of the two-stage operation. As soon as possible after Royal Assent payments can begin—the trustees will know immediately roughly what proportion will be regarded as unfunded, because they will need payments from the start in order to manage the scheme properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formal determination is the second stage, under subsection (2). A time limit is given in the Bill, but it is hoped that it will not take too long before the determination is reached, although it will be subject to the statutory consultation if the manuscript amendment is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) describes the process by which—again I use lay language—the final arithmetic will be done. It is most convenient for that to be done by the actuaries to the schemes. The Minister will, therefore, make a determination which will mean, in practice, that he will direct the actuaries to the scheme on the methods to be used and, in particular, the assumptions to be made in doing the calculations. That would be the case if the Minister had to make a contested determination, but even if he did not, and there were an agreed one, he would have the power to issue the determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that subsection (5) covers is the way in which the Minister will exercise responsibility in giving directions to the actuary on the assumptions to apply in the calculations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to get this clear. The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to imply that payments would start to be made immediately after Royal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1984</span>
Assent. If that is so, will he tell us how the payments will be made and on what basis?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the difficulties is that we cannot do anything until after Royal Assent, although clearly some preliminary meetings between Government and pension fund advisers on the basis of the calculations have taken place and will continue. As soon as possible after Royal Assent, following the procedure in subsection 1(	<i>a</i>) a rough and ready determination will be made and payments will start straight away. But the basis of those payments will emerge when the Minister as made his determination as described in subsection 1(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that, the process will be more refined and a more precise determination will be arrived at. We shall as soon as possible reach the position described in subsection 1(	<i>b</i>) and a final determination will be made. That will be put into practice by instructions being given to the actuary for the pension schemes that certain assumptions have to be made, and various procedures followed. He will then do his sums and produce the unfunded proportion in each case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise again two points with the Parliamentary Secretary which have not been referred to since his initial response. One is his assertion that the Government will consult the board and trustees, but that there is no need to consult trade unions separately. That seems to me to ignore the fact that in a sense there is no need even to consult the board separately and that ultimately the only consultation that needs to take place is with the trustees. They are the people who will have the direct responsibility for the consequences of the determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But it may than be argued that the board would be affected by that determination because it would have to make up any shortfall if the Minister's contribution were insufficient. The board would then have an interest because payment might have to come from British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consideration that unions should be consulted is equally valid. They are the only bodies that are actually representing the members. The trustees of the pension fund do not represent member as such. Their function is to look after the fund. Consequently, the three trade unions are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1078">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1985</span>
the only bodies that represent members—that is, those who were paying in and are potential beneficiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister's determination of a sum is not large enough it could happen—I am not saying that it is bound to happen or even that it is likely—that the staff will have to pay either by increased contributions or reduced pensions. I believe therefore that if there is a case for consulting the board there is an equally convincing case for consulting the unions. They are both parties to the matter and both are represented on the board of trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is to be accepted from the outset that the initial determination is nothing more than a guess to enable the process of paying out to commence—perhaps that guess will be a quarter of the final determination, or something of that sort—the need for consultation at that stage will not be so great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary shook his head at that point. That bothers me, because if some weight is attached to the initial determination—and we all live in a world where people are susceptible to all kinds of human failings—I would not like us to go to a position where someone takes responsibility for making that initial determination, stakes a little professional credit on it, and then starts consulting about whether it can be changed. That would be basically a defensive approach by the Government Actuary, and consequently by the Minister, to protect the initial guess made by the Government Actuary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it will be very much a guess, and we ought not to put either the actuary—I am sure that it is a group of people—or the Minister in a position where they feel they have so committed themselves by making an initial determination that they then have to defend that determination. After the consultations and the elapse of a period—which must be up to one year from the first determination—all those whom they consult could quite rightly be totally dissatisfied with the initial determination and feel that there were good reasons why it should be varied. I am sure that they would want to vary it upwards but there will be constant pressure on the Government Actuary and the Minister to vary it downwards, so the chance is that if it is not regarded as a wide guess to get things going—a type of pump-priming exercise—we will get a figure in the initial determination which all the other parties
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1986</span>
will regard as being on the low side. It will have been pitched low to begin with by the actuary and the Minister, because they will expect that all the other parties to the consultations will wish to bid up the figure. Consequently, because there will be a kind of horse-trading process, they are likely to slice a bit off even then and possibly pitch it even lower.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not like to envisage a position where anyone would necessarily attach a great deal of weight to the initial determination. If there is that weight there should be consultation about the amount. There is no reason why those talks should not start tomorrow if the clause was law. There is every reason why consultations should take place before Royal Assent. If that could be arranged we would be well on the way to agreement. There ought to be consultations on the initial figure because it will set the tone for the remainder of the consultations. And, with the best will in the world, the person making the initial determination will stick to it if only on the grounds of
	<br><q><p>"'tis a poor thing, but mine own."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make only a brief intervention in view of what the Parliamentary Secretary said. He made clear that he wishes to assist with the management committee and consultations. The difference between us now is whether there should be separate consultations for trade unions. I understand the Parliamentary Secretary's view to be that in this case, as they are already represented on the management committee, that is sufficient for the consultations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is not in doubt, and I do not think the Minister wishes to put forward any other view, is that the trade unions should have a right to consultation in these matters. That was the opinion that we gave in a letter in 1977 in which we stated that there was the obligation to reach agreement, not merely to consult. Here we are not even suggesting that there has to be agreement. We are talking about consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, an assumption that members of trade unions will be represented on the committee. I have not been convinced so far, especially in relation to railway trade unions, that one railway trade union necessarily feels that a second on the board will reflect the interest of the first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1987</span>
The assumption seems to be that all three trade unions will be represented on the management committee. That would seem fair. I have been informed that TSSA is not represented—I am not sure whether that is true. If it is true, clearly all trade unions may not be represented on the committee. That would create difficulties, particularly if ASLEF felt that the NUR was representing ASLEF's views on pensions or vice versa. Important matters are involved here about which all trade unions should have the right to be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument does not rest solely on whether all the trade union representatives are elected, by whatever process, to sit on the management committee. There is a legitimate argument that there should be a statutory obligation to consult the trade unions. It should not be left to a body such as the management committee onto which trade union representatives may or may not be elected. Indeed, sometimes trade unionists in their representative capacity sit on committees yet are specifically asked not to relate financial information to their organisations. They frequently have to wear two hats. All too often I have heard the general secretaries of organisations to which I belong saying, "I am sorry; I cannot tell you any more about that. The information was given to me in confidence." In financial matters the general secretary may well compromise himself and the interests of his union if the only consultation is that which takes place at the management committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a separate argument whether such people should be on the committee or not. I am asking whether there should be a separate statutory obligation on the Government to consult the trade unions about pension matters. Those are two different arguments. We should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us whether under the present process, which he feels is satisfactory, the trade unions are represented. I should also like to know whether TSSA is on the committee at present. However, we do not rest our case on that argument. We think that, particularly in view of the changes now proposed and the insecurity about pensions felt by those in the industry, there should be a separate statutory obligation for consultation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1988</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is already a precedent for what my hon. Friend suggests. Although the British Railways Board is represented on the pensions management board it still consults individually all the unions involved. Surely that is a parallel to the case being argued by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it—perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me if I am wrong—the board has a separate right to be consulted quite distinct from the scheme itself. The Government are consulting everyone about the scheme except the one party with the greatest interest in it. That is not because they believe that the trade unions should not be consulted, but because they believe that unions should only have the right to be consulted inside the management committee, where the other forces are also represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the Parliamentary Secretary believes what he said about unions being represented on the committee, in order to be even-handed he should ensure that that comes about as of right rather than by chance. He has given that right to the board and to the committee. If he is giving it to management he should give it to labour, which is also interested in pension negotiations. Whatever happens to pensions will be heavily influenced by what happens to wage rates. That is one of the important factors relating to salaries and pensions in such schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are getting into rather a pother about nothing very much. Not that the question is not important. It is important. But I do not think that there is any difference between us. Nevertheless we seem to be getting more and more bogged down. Perhaps I was wrong to put down a manuscript amendment. If the position cannot be resolved perhaps I had better withdraw it and put down another amendment later that will make the position clear. But I do not think that there is any real problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the position of the trade unions, I remember that when you were in office, Mr. Dean, you consistently reasserted your belief in the right of trade unions to have maximum information on behalf of their members about pension rights and the value of trade union consultation and involvement in occupational pension schemes. When I spoke on those matters,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1080">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1989</span>
I concurred with that view. I see no reason why a trade union should not be closely involved in the administration of a fund in which its members have a legitimate interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In talking about consultation in the general sense, as opposed to the provisions of the Bill, it seems eminently sensible that all trade unions—that is, all that have recognised bargaining rights—should be consulted and my understanding is that they are now being involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is going on to the second stage. What we are talking about becomes a little unreal. Much consultation already goes on. We are not waiting for Royal Assent before we start talking, as everyone in the Committee knows. There have already been talks and there will be more talks, between the Government, the scheme managers and the trade union representatives, about the basis on which we shall calculate the unfunded proportion. All those discussions will continue, whatever we put into the Bill. It is proper that they should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are putting into the Bill a statutory duty to consult as a final reassurance in case there is breakdown in relationships before the final determination stage, although at the moment I am aware that we are nowhere near that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we are illustrating the slight danger of statutory consultation as opposed to leaving the matter to common sense and judgment on all sides. The issue arose at an earlier stage in our discussion of the Bill. Once statutory consultation is written into the Bill, consultation is compulsory, or one must face the possibility of a legal challenge. In order to be statutory, consultation cannot start until Royal Assent. That does not mean that no consultation could take place, but it will not count for the purpose of the Act, even if the consultation is finished and everyone is bored to death with talking to each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Parliament in its wisdom put consultation in the Act, all the parties would have to meet, agree that they were bored to death, break up and agree that they had consulted before going any further. Because of those doubts, and in an attempt to resolve them, my right hon. Friend has given the undertaking that he will write into the Bill a duty to consult. However, I ask the Committee not to make the matter more involved so that all parties become bogged down in an unnec-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1990</span>
essary and prolonged process of useless discussion that may delay the final determination which is in the interests of everyone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept that, as drafted, the amendments might create problems. However, will the Parliamentary Secretary not accept that the problem of consultations prior to Royal Assent counting for nothing could easily be covered by inserting the formula that the Minister will not make the first determination until he is satisfied that appropriate consultations have been carried out? There would be no reason why they should not be carried out before the Royal Assent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I think that that is unnecessary. We all know that consultations have been taking place. Why do we need to write into the Bill that we must be satisfied that consultations have taken place, when we have already been in touch with all the parties and have every intention of remaining in touch in an attempt to reach an agreement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the first stage, for the avoidance of doubt and for the satisfaction of all parties, we are prepared to write in, as I have indicated, a statutory duty to consult. That seemed to be welcomed at first, but doubts have arisen because the board is mentioned without the magic words "trade unions".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three distinct bodies have a direct legal interest in the determinations. One is the management committee that administers the fund and pay out the pensions. The second is the board because the board's legal liabilities to the fund will be carried by the Government, who are the third body and will produce the money by the mechanism described in the Bill to back up the board. For that reason, it is appropriate to refer to those three parties in the statute, because those are the parties with a financial and legal interest in what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade unions have a legitimate interest, just as every member of the Committee has, in what is going on. Their interest is more direct than ours because they represent the beneficiaries whose pensions are financed by this mechanism. The logic of the Opposition's argument seems to be that they are making sure that we are not trying to double-cross them in this undertaking. They appear to want us to write into the Bill a list of every trade
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1991</span>
union that represents members of the British Rail or NFC pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By using the method that we propose—which takes in the three legal entities with a financial interest; after all, it is their money that is involved in the entire transaction—fund management committees will all contain senior trade union representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition may be better advised on the day-to-day administration of the fund than I am, because they seem to be in contact with those who are doing it. I am told that the TSSA is not on the wages grade fund management committee because it has almost no members in that scheme. But it is represented on the management committees of the other schemes in which it has members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the NFC and BR have the best form of pensions practice—trade union representatives on the management committees and, I hope, full disclosure of information to members through those representatives. Our statutory duty to consult will involve union representatives on management committees. I did not follow the point raised by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull (Mr. Prescott) about the possibility of a general secretary somehow sacrificing his members' interests in internal discussions in the management committee. That stretches matters rather far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consultation process will involve full disclosure to trade union representatives. Presumably they are on the management committee because they are the members of the union leadership with the most direct interest and expertise in their members' pension rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fanciful to imagine that such trade union pensions experts will either adopt a position of total secrecy in respect of other member unions or will reach a bad deal compared with that which might be arrived at if the entire union were consulted. As I suspect that all the general secretaries of the unions involved will be on one committee or another, we shall, if the unions are written in, be put in the anomalous position of consulting precisely the same people who already receive all the information through management committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that there is no conflict of interest between the trade unions and the management of the scheme or the board. As the hon. Member for Holborn
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1992</span>
and St. Pancras South said, if there is an area of doubt in the calculations, the board, members of the schemes, their management committees and trade unions have exactly the same interest, namely trying to get the Government to take on as big a proportion of the obligations as possible. There is no employer-employee dispute here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All the experts are at one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They will all be pressing in the same direction. Therefore I suggest that the Opposition should be satisfied with what is being offered and that they are splitting hairs and imagining differences of interest or opinion that will not arise by insisting that we make yet another attempt to write into the Bill an endless list of those who need to be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not splitting hairs. We propose something that is common form in many Bills. It is common to have such a provision as amendment no. 327 in Bills that affect employees' interests. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take my word for it that on a number of occasions recently I have tried to contact people with a direct interest in railway pension schemes, including those in the trade unions concerned. It has not been my experience that trade unions are as well informed about railway pensions matters as some others, particularly those involved in the running of schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one were to rely solely on the management committee in the case of the British Railways superannuation fund, which is one of the biggest funds of historic pension rights, one would be talking of a management committee on which there is not a TSSA representative. The committee which runs that fund is, according to my information, elected by the members every three years. Whether they choose to elect representatives of management or unions is a matter for them, but we are talking not about that, but about a once-for-all event under the Bill—the point at which there is a final determination of the proportions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that on that one special occasion representatives of the employees should be consulted in that way. That is not an unreasonable proposition and if the Minister wants to broaden matters by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1082">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1993</span>
manuscript amendment and make the consultation wider than the management committee we have no disagreement with him. He may take that view, and we shall not disagree, that the BRB has direct legal and financial interests in the determination, but we do not share his view that the trade unionists who are represented on the committee do not also have a direct financial interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the contrary, we contend that they have such an interest and because their pensions and historic rights are at stake it is reasonable to suggest that they should be treated in an even-handed way as are the two other bodies that have a direct interest in the determination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure where that leads us. I suppose that we had better see on what matters the Opposition call Divisions in the light of this rather perplexing situation. On the matter of which funds have TSSA officials involved in the management committees, it is not too surprising that TSSA representatives are not on the management committees of funds in which it has hardly any members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been consulting the management committee of the BR superannuation fund and, in contact with my officials, at least two people have described themselves as representatives of the TSSA. I believe that it will be found that TSSA representatives are on that fund as trade unions which have members in each fund appear to have representatives on the management committees of the respective funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I thought that I was refusing anything of substance to the Opposition in tabling my amendment I might be prepared to look again at it, but I have tried to explain that I do not believe that there is anything of substance between us and that in practice what has been put forward will give the fullest possible statutory right to information for the trade unions. In any event, in practice they will be given as much consultation as necessary by my Department in the course of reaching the necessary conclusions and determinations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the Parliamentary Secretary what he said is not correct.

statutory right to representatives of the board and the management committee, it is a denial of a statutory right that he wants the Committee to accept. It cannot be a matter of great import to the Parliamentary Secretary if he accepts that the consultation should go ahead anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pity that we should break down on this issue. Why cannot the Parliamentary Secretary give an undertaking that he will at least consider making the right of consultation in the Bill on the sole narrow question of the determination of the proportion a right which is accorded to the representatives of the employees, the management committee and the board of the fund? They form three interested bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall not accept amendment No. 327 because that leaves open which representatives and which employees. If we are to make clear that there is a duty to consult trade unions, it must be trade unions which represent the interests of members of the scheme.

doubts on the ability of the trade union members of the management committee to represent the members. It appears to me that the Opposition are not satisfied that those trade unionists who sit on the mangement committees of the pension funds will represent the best interests of their own members, and they want it expressly written into the Bill that there should be separate consultations with the same trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will be consulting exactly the same people, however the Bill is worded. We are counting the number of angels dancing on the head of a pin.

This amendment is of crucial importance—not that other amendments are not important to those directly affected. But this amendment has a special importance as it bears upon all those schemes with historic pension liabilities which will be subject to a determination on what proportion is funded and what proportion is to be covered by pay-as-you.go. If one puts to one side for the purpose of this amendment those supplementation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1996</span>
schemes covered in clause 47, we are talking about all the other schemes which are not fully funded and have historic obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue raised by the amendment is whether we should seek to ensure that Government support for these historic pension liabilities can be adjusted in future years in such a way as to enable proper account to be taken of all those factors which go into determining what is the correct proportion—namely, the rate of inflation, the investment rate and the rate of increase in public service pensions. Those factors, which in practice will determine whether the proportion is right, cannot, if the Bill is unamended, be taken into account when they are known. They have to be assumed. A judgment has to be made in advance of the event, and I hope I shall be able to demonstrate in no uncertain terms that it is almost impossible to have any confidence that a correct determination can be made within a year of passing the Bill. There is so much at stake that I see the debate as being of enormous importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is passed, the danger that the initial assessment may turn out to be hopelessly wrong in the light of subsequent events may be avoided. The Government support payments will, as a result of the determination having been wrong, either be too little or too great. If we are to consider the matter objectively, we must allow for the fact that the calculation might be wrong in either direction. The effect of being wrong in one direction is different from being wrong in the other. Nevertheless, the effect is serious in either case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing a possible surplus or deficit that could run into hundreds of millions of pounds. One of the reasons why my hon. Friends and I contend that the scheme of support proposed in the Bill may turn out to be far less satisfactory than the present scheme is that this grave doubt exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill poses the almost impossible task of attempting to make a prediction in circumstances that are almost unpredictable. I shall give one example, but it is one that is based on what is undoubtedly the biggest of the funds involved—the British Railways superannuation fund. That is the modern pension fund for railway salaried staff and is the biggest of the funds covered by the Bill in terms of historic liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1997</span>
The figures that I shall give are based on current actuarial values. The estimates of the present value of the historic liability of this one fund range from £600 million to £1,200 million—a 100 per cent. difference. But whether the figure is £600 million or £1,200 million will depend upon exactly the factors that the Minister will give to the actuaries if he fails to obtain agreement. It depends upon assumptions made about inflation rates, future returns for investment and other factors—all of which must be judged on a once-for-all basis if the Bill is passed in its present form. I am not stretching the limits of possible variations. I am advised that the liability could be less than £600 million or more than £1,200 million, although these figures are based upon current actuarial values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The investments in this fund, where the liabilities may vary to such an extent, are approximately £300 million. They are held in respect of the historic liability, so that the investments held could turn out to be either half or 25 per cent. of what is required. There is such a massive difference between the two estimates that one is bound to hit the target somewhere, but it is almost impossible to hit the centre. The deficit of the fund, therefore, is between £300 million and £900 million depending on the factors that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose, for the purpose of this argument, that the Government decides to assess the calculation of the deficit at £500 million, which is within the range of possibilities. If they did that, the unfunded proportion of the fund would be 62.5 per cent. of the liabilities because there would be a deficit of £500 million over liabilities of £800 million. On that the Minister presumably proposes to say "henceforth, we shall find, by our pay-as-you-go method, the cost of meeting 62½ per cent. of the liabilities for that major fund with those major historic liabilities."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give his attention to that, because this is a serious attempt to explore his proposition—not ours, but his. He is trying to convince the House, which is regarded by the Conservative Government as supreme in such matters, that that should be the law of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, for that one major fund, the determination is that 62½ per cent. is to be met
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1998</span>
by pay-as-you-go, and the remaining 37½ per cent. by the funds already there, it will work out correctly only if all the assumptions are correct. Or, if one assumption varies in one direction, and another in another, it could just conceivably work out right. However, the likelihood is that it will turn out wrong. Let us look at what would happen if it turned out wrong within the limits of the present actuarial valuation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has perhaps not noticed that my attention to him is becoming a little strained. I think that he has not yet directed himself to the main point. I realise the considerable range of possibilities that may occur if the actuarial assumptions are wrong. The main point is that all this arises under the 1974 Act. That was for a once-and-for-all determination to be fixed in 1979. There was no possibility of variation in that. If the actuarial calculations on which the funding orders were made were wrong, any surplus made would accrue to the board, and any deficiency would have to be paid up by the board. It would find itself liable to top-up the fund. The right hon. Gentleman labours very heavily a point which arises clearly from the 1974 Act. He is making the most of a problem which the managers must have been facing for a very long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Parliamentary Secretary has demonstrated is that he was not giving attention to the argument. I was talking about something which cannot occur under the present scheme and can occur only as a result of the proposition in the Bill. I have explained why. Under the present scheme, there is an absolute legal commitment on the part of the Government to carry through, between now and 1986, the successive stages of a very substantial funding. In those circumstances, as the inflation rate changes and as the return on investment changes, that will change the amount which is paid into the fund as a result of investments which can be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course it must affect the amount which can be earned on investments made by funding arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1999</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must do so. The British Railways Board trustees have been making their investments on the assumption that they can either use this funding to pay directly the historic pension liabilities that fall upon them, or they can arrange their investments in accordance with their funding expectations over this period with a very substantial insurance of funds coming to them. That they cannot do under the Bill. They will have to address themselves to the fact that, once there is a determination on a major fund, no more funds will come to them from the Government. They will not have the funds to which they are now legally entitled, and they will have to use such funding as they already have to meet the proportion of liability which the Minister will determine for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of a fund where determination is that 62½ per cent. is unfunded, the trustees must use whatever funding they have to meet it. They will have to realise on such funding as they have now, in advance of 1986. The Parliamentary Secretary cannot deny it. It is obvious. That is the problem posed by the Bill, and it is not posed by the present legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the true liability of a fund that has been assessed by the Minister as £800 million turns out to be £1,200 million, these massive liabilities will meet the fund. The Government will obviously have to meet more, but they will meet only the 62½ per cent.—£750 million out of £1,200 million—and the remaining liability will fall upon those who administer the fund. They will have only the proportion—37½ per cent.—of the originally estimated liability, not of the true liability. How will they cover the difference? Who will find the extra £150 million? That question does not arise under existing legislation and it is no good the Parliamentary Secretary saying that it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present there is a guarantee of substantial additional funding coming the way of the board, up to 1986, and it has made a whole series of calculations on how such money should be invested. Those calculations will inevitably prove to be wrong. The board will be put into an impossible position by the determination. If the outturn of liability in the case of that fund were £1,200 million, it would be most unlikely that the board could find the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2000</span>
other £150 million. The funding that is finally determined under the present legal scheme—if the Bill does not go through—may produce a surplus or a deficit, but that would occur over much longer time scales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because there is presently scope to adjust the amounts paid up to 1986 within the total amount of the Government's liability and subject to their paying interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The payments that we shall be avoiding under the Bill are fixed on 1979 actuarial assumptions. It will be a once-and-for-all settlement and there will be no variation. The Government have a fixed liability under the 1974 Act and there is no room under it to vary the actuarial assumptions or review them over the next four or five years when they would fall due for payment if we did not change the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to repeat the argument that we had the other night, when I made it clear that the liability was not fixed in 1974. It is fixed now. Between 1974 and the present, there was a period in which adjustments could be made and the amount reduced—by up to 20 per cent. In the case of some funds. A guarantee was given that an agreement would be reached on what was appropriate funding. That is now going out of the window. The Bill provides no guarantee that agreement will be reached on the appropriate funding of the proportion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary must understand that it will be very hard for those charged with running a fund to agree what is appropriate in these circumstances. If he is saying that it is a weakness of the existing legislation that it does not provide for adjustment beyond the present day, we can probably sympathise with that argument, but it is an argument in favour of our amendment and not against it. Our amendment is postulated on the basis that it is desirable to have some scope for adjustment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put this proposition to the Parliamentary Secretary. If, in the case I quoted, those people who are running this British Railways Superannuation Fund scheme find themselves £150 million short on the scheme, they will look around desperately
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2001</span>
and may well ask the Government to try to safeguard the position of pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could give many other instances of where it would fail. But let us take the case of an actuarial valuation which is made on the Minister's direction and which turns out to over-estimate the liability. That would be just as serious from a public expenditure point of view. After all, the present Government pride themselves on being highly concerned about looking after taxpayers' money and public expenditure. The liability turns out to be only £600 million, instead of the amount which the Government estimated and on which they calculated that they would meet their proportion. If it turned out to be £600 million, the Government would still have to meet 62½ per cent of £600 million—in other words, they would have to meet £370 million—and the remaining liability of £230 million would then have to be met from a fund which was £300 million. So the fund would be in considerable surplus. There would be a £70 million windfall which could provide additional pensions for members of the pension fund, and the Government support would have to continue at 62½ per cent of an historic rate, despite the granting of all these additional premiums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case, of course, the Government, in bringing forward this legislation, would have thrown away public money at the very time when they are claiming that they will save it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members believe that it is much better for the Bill to contain a provision which allows for an adjustment to be made either way when the actual outcome is known. If we find that there has been an over-funding by the determination of the proportion, then the amount that the Government pay should be able to be reduced, and if we discover that in practice there is an under-provision in the determination of the proportion, then that should be increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there is the important factor that if the assessment of the unfunded portion turns out to be too generous, it will put the Government and the House of Commons in a very difficult position. What would the House do if some future Government brought in a Bill and said "Here is the Public Accounts Committee criticising us again because the legislation we put through in 1980 is causing public money to be paid in respect of historic pension rights way over and above what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2002</span>
is required"? What would that Government do? Would they say "We are justified in having another Bill because we have been criticised by the Public Accounts Committee"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to know whether the Minister has consulted the Public Accounts Committee about this proposition particularly a Minister who seeks to justify the proposition in the Bill on the ground that there has been a criticism by the Public Accounts Committee. I find it almost impossible to believe that the Public Accounts Committee would want the Minister to gamble on a proposition on which one could toss a coin. If the coin comes down heads for the pensioners, they will get an uncovenanted benefit of additional public money towards historic pension rights which they are not guaranteed now. If the coin comes down tails, they will be faced by a British Railways Board which does not have the money to meet the unfunded proportion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looked at from the taxpayer's point of view—a taxpayer who does not care about the British Rail pensioner; not a very typical character—if the coin comes down one way, he will pay out more than he should pay, and if it comes down the other way, he will certainly be paying less than was guaranteed in a provision made in a promise of legislation to those who operate these pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are therefore arguing for something that we believe is equitable as between taxpayer and British Railways pensioner. It makes sense in public expenditure terms and it does not rest a proposition as important as how we discharge these very difficult historic pension liabilities on what is little more than the throw of a dice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue my right hon. Friend's arguments as that would take longer than I would wish. I shall deal with another aspect, to which I hope that the Minister will address himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak as a member of the LNER scheme right through to the present scheme. One must not forget that the liabilities and the eventual payments are based upon the final salary of the person concerned. A person who joined the scheme prior to the Minister's date of 1 January 1975 will therefore receive payment out of the scheme based on his salary at retirement. Do the Government's calculations take account of that? The Min-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1087">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2003</span>
ister cannot have his cake and eat it as well. He says that the Government will honour all commitments up to 1 January 1975. That is historical. We are talking about historic pensions. The pension of anyone who joined before that date will be calculated on his salary at retirement. What calculation has been made for that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the 1974 Act laid down a guaranteed form of payment up to 1986. If there is a guaranteed payment up to 1986, the pension fund could—I do not say "should", but it could if it so desired—borrow against that money and invest it. The difference between that and the present proposal, which is the worst of both worlds—it is not so much pay-as-you-go as simply bad funding—is that the money to be paid up to 1986 under the 1974 Act could at least have been invested, but under the Bill that will not necessarily be so. That is the difference between those who argue for a funded scheme and those who argue for a pay-as-you-go scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given all those points, the Minister must surely accept the amendment, because once again we are trying to be helpful. He freely admits that it is possible to be wrong. The man who never made a mistake never did anything. If something goes wrong, the amendment would allow the Minister to have another bite at the cherry and put it right. The Bill refers to a "determination" and then to "a further determination". On my reading, that means that there are two. Had it said "further determinations", in the plural, that would be a different kettle of fish altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to give credibility to what the Minister himself has said. As I understand it, up to 1979 the Minister was telling the trade unions, "The proposals do not mean that pensions will be lower than they would otherwise be." How can he possibly make that statement, in all truth and honesty, when in effect one year after the scheme comes forward he makes a final assessment on which he bases his entire credibility? If he is wrong, the statement that he made to the trade unions in October will be untrue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in order to help the Minister out once again, as we have continually tried to do since last November, we are saying that we realise that the Minister or his Department may possibly be wrong. If the Government cover themselves by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2004</span>
accepting the amendment, in the event of their being wrong the pensioners will not suffer. That is the key matter—we are dealing with people. If there is the slightest doubt about any calculations and pensioners suffering, surely it makes sense to accept the amendment and make credible previous Government statements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The objective of amendment No. 196 is to provide a review by the Minister, from time to time, of the determination that will be carried out within the space of a year and, as we understand it, stand for ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill means that the final assessment will be calculated by the Minister and he will have only one chance to correct or vary that. Our amendment would give him the power to review any emerging liabilities on pension payment as more and more people retire, what may happen to a fund, changes in the rate of inflation and all those changes to which the flesh of the British economy is heir.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall the Parliamentary Secretary's words in a previous debate when he pulled me up? He stated that being an actuary and actuarial calculations were in no sense scientific. The predictions were artistic. Would not my hon. Friend agree that if being an actuary and actuarial calculations are not scientific but contain a measure of the scientific—or speculative—it is doubly certain that we should put some flexibility into the whole operation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. To repeat an old joke, we doubt whether there will be any technical merit in the adjudication that is to be made and are absolutely certain that there will be no marks for artistic impression. We do not reckon on much of technical merit coming from the Ministry of Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that people will be affected by that determination up to 80 years after it is made. Historic pensions do not necessarily relate to historic pensioners. There are some fairly youthful members of BR's staff who are in the historic underfunded parts of the scheme. If they marry women younger than themselves, their widows could be receiving pensions from that fund 80 years or more from now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is taking unto himself a once-and-for-all calculation of the rate of increase in wage and price inflation for 20
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2005</span>
years—or 80 years. He will be doing the same for the rate of increase in public sector pensions, because he must make that calculation as well. Again, he will do the same for the estimated rate of return on the investment funds that are in the funded part of the scheme. It is absolutely absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He could rely on the Treasury or even on people at the Ministry of Transport. Those people have not been in the business of making actuarial guesses, but for many years they have estimated the amount of road traffic. I have checked that today. If one examines page 83 the Leitch report, one finds that in 1965—this is an example of the errors in forecasting by the Ministry of Transport that can arise—the forecast of car ownership by 1975, that is, one decade forward, was 18.2 million, the actual ownership in 1975 was 13.7 million. That was an error approaching 50 per cent. That was in a sphere where it is claimed that the Ministry of Transport have some expertise—not that one could notice—and it was for only one decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of this estimate, we are talking of something where the bulk of the funds will be affected for something between 20 and 30 years, that is, two or three decades, and the Ministry has not a hope in hell of making a sensible prediction, whether the Ministry is Nostradamus, the Parliamentary Secretary is Gypsy Rose Lee and the whole Department is ploughing through Old More's Almanac. They will not be able to come up with any sort of determination even with the benefit of consultation with the trustees of the scheme, the trade unions, the board of Uncle Tom Cobleigh. They will be unable to come up with a determination which will be likely to be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will make a safe prediction on one point. That is that the determination will be wrong. Everybody can agree that the once-for-all determination will be wrong, and the question is: how wrong will it be? As my right hand Friend pointed out, even now one can obtain estimates of the deficit on the main fund. On conservative estimates—in other words, the minimum range of responsible estimates—there will be a deficit from £600 million up to one of £1,000 million. That is an increase of only 100 per cent. on the lower figure and that is before we have started to talk about the future or before looking at the intricacies of the other schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2006</span>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Ispwich (Mr. Weetch) talked about art and science. I do not know whether it is maths, physics, metaphysics or astrophysics. It is probably astrophysics—it will be astronomical, so it might well be astro-physic—that is to be used to work this out. It could be a conjuring trick, but the main point is that it will be guess work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have guesses it is absurd that there should be just one guess, because, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), the Minister said that the proposals do not mean that pensions will be lower than they would otherwise be and do not imply any increase in current service pension contributions. Unless the Parliamentary Secretary accepts the amendment on behalf of the Minister, he will automatically be giving the lie to that statement, because if there is any error on the low side in this determination, there are only three possibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that British Rail will be crippled because it will have to make contributions to the funds to make up the part not being made up by the Minister. I cannot believe that it is an objective of the Government's policy to cripple British Rail at one stage removed. The alternatives are that smaller benefits will be paid to the pensioners or there will be higher contributions from those members of the scheme who are still working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary cannot get away from the fact that if there is a shortfall, one, two or all three of those possibilities will automatically follow. He may say that this would have been a consequence of the 1974 provisions, but there are arguments about whether that is true because had the funding process gone through, those operating the pension funds would have had a certain element of flexibility—an opportunity for a flexible response to the problems that arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not exaggerate that aspect, because not having been here in 1974, 1978 or early 1979 I do not need to take responsibility for that. In any case, I think that even that form of determination, flexible though it was, was still not sufficiently flexible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Conservatives are awake. If that is so, why have we sat and argued for the past three hours when the Parliamentary Secretary says that there is no change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. If there is no change, the Parliamentary Secretary might as well accept everything that we say. If we are proposing a change, it is a change for the better. It is a sensible change that ought to commend itself to anyone who is concerned about sensible funding of these pension schemes and a sensible way of dealing with British Rail's future finances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend has been accused of alarmism. I am at present in correspondence with the Metropolitan Police Commissioner about the over-use of burglar alarms in central London. We are alarmed about burglary by the Treasury of the pensioners in this scheme. The Treasury is behind the Parliamentary Secretary's obstruction of our eminently sensible proposal. The Treasury will wring its hands and say that financial propriety demands that that be done for the sake of the taxpayer, and that it cannot enter into open-ended commitments. That is claptrap. The Treasury talks about financial propriety, but what about the financial impropriety to which it turned its back in the early years of these pension schemes, when it and successive Governments knew that the funding of allegedly funded pension schemes was not going ahead?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the workers subsidised the management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The workers were making contributions to the scheme, and the board were not making proper equivalent contributions because the Treasury was keeping their finances squeezed down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury was making sure that it did not have to fork out the necessary funds for either capital or revenue expenditure by British Rail. It is no good for the Treasury suddenly to take an interest in financial propriety. Its impropriety
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2008</span>
over the years has put these schemes in their present position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be said that the management of British Rail or, for that matter, the management of some pension schemes has been at fault. However, the Treasury has an ultimate responsibility which it cannot just assume when it wishes, having shuffled it off in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are looking for provision for a review, from time to time, of what is at present a one-off determination. I think that we have demonstrated that a one-off determination is absurd. There is no justification for it, because the determination is bound to be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took the opportunity this afternoon not to listen in the House to the Front-Bench speeches in the censure debate, but to plough on as far as clause 46. In that clause there is provision for review of the determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no difference in principle. I am advised that on clause 46 the question whether a particular payment by a pension scheme corresponds to a historic obligation will be a matter of fact and law, and will not admit of alternative answers. In a case where it is factual—where there is no speculation or guesswork—it will be necessary to have annual determinations, or new determinations from time to time. That is in the factual sphere. Yet in a sphere which is highly speculative—for example the rate of inflation over the next 20 years—there is no provision for the review of the first determination. It seems that it is indefensible to have a review where the determination is based entirely on facts, and no review where it is based on speculation. If the Minister can justify that, he can square the circle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In those circumstances, three possible consequences would flow. There would be lower pensions for the pensioners, higher contributions for the contributors or an amazing, crippling load of debts placed on British Rail. It would be absurd

if the Committee were to accept that proposition. I therefore hope that the Minister will see sense. He may be unable to commit himself because of the looming shadow of the Treasury, but I hope that he will go away and say to the Treasury "This is barmy. We must have further determinations after the first."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to clarify the difference between the two sides. I will keep as brief as possible the repetition of what I said this morning when we began the proceedings and I tried to make as clear as I could what the policy issue would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policy of the Bill is that the Government will stand behind the board for a certain defined area of pensions obligations to the same extent as previous Governments did under the 1974 Act. As I said this morning—no more and no less—we are not in any way altering the nature of the Government's support except for the method by which it is given. The extent of the support remains unchanged, the method by which it is achieved is altered by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, I understand that Opposition Members were content with the 1974 settlement. I do not think that they have queried it so far. The burden of their case is that the 1974 settlement is preferable to the changes that we are proposing. They are seeking at every stage to go back to the 1974 settlement. I am trying to convince them that our proposals make no difference to the pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are saving just £1,000 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The managers of the fund lose £1,200 million that they were looking forward to investing. It is no doubt a very entertaining prospect. But for the Government and the beneficiaries there is no difference. All the arguments are coming from the people who were looking forward to the pleasure of having an investment programme of £1,200 million with which to occupy themselves over the next 12 years. They are the people most directly affected. There are no pensioners' interests in this and there is no difference in the quality of the Government's support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us now return to the 1974 Act. Labour members who wish to challenge the 1974 Act settlement may do so. It was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2010</span>
as follows. British Rail had by that time acquired pensions obligations, a proportion of which it was in no position to finance. So it had acquired unfunded pensions obligations—great deficiencies in funding. The finances of British Rail were such that it could not meet its legal liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government of the day dealt with that in various stages. First, the pensions remained the board's legal liability. It was to the board and its fund managers that pensioners looked for the satisfaction of their pensions claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the policy of the 1974 Act that British Rail should be given the means by which it could meet those obligations. The obligations need to be funded. An attempt was made to go towards funding on an instalment basis, and particularly on the basis of actuarial calculations of the amount of the fund that would be needed to place it in the same position as an ordinary funded occupational fund. The funding was to be reached by instalments, so actuarial calculations were made of each instalment. It is claimed that an undertaking was given in a letter to agree the actuarial calculations. That is not strictly accurate. There was a letter in 1977, relating to the method of calculating the No. 4 order, which, for reasons of public expenditure control, altered the basic upon which the assumptions were made. That letter is now being freely quoted out of context, as though it implied some previous commitment of the Government and board to agree, at all stages, the actuarial calculations of all orders. From my information, that is not its meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreement to calculate, by making actuarial assumptions, the extent of the instalments, was to be a one-off process. The Government's obligations had been fixed in money terms by 1979, on the basis of the best actuarial calculations that could be made. It was steadily to be handed over, but the actuarial assumptions were not to be changed. The board knew in 1979 the extent of the money fund that it could anticipate, once the payments had been made, to meet its pensions obligations. That was aimed at putting it in the position of any other funded occupational pension. But no funded pension has a continuing Government guarantee that they will keep revising the actuarial sums on which it was first created, nor was that ever the intention on this fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2011</span>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) was greatly concerned when he visualised this situation, but a funded occupational pension, as of now, must have a given level of funds, derived from the contributions of employers and employees over the years and invested to produce a given rate of return. Actuaries will calculate roughly the extent of each fund's obligations. That will involve making the best possible estimates of likely future wage increases and rates of inflation—particularly for an inflation-proofed scheme. Against that they must calculate the likely performance of their funds. That is why actuaries and fund managers are employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assumptions change over the years and at every stage it is the duty of the fund managers to try to invest their funds to perform at an adequate level to meet the obligations. Every now and again, actuaries go along to the employers—those under the legal duty to pay the pensions—and say "Unfortunately, the actuarial assumptions have changed, and it looks as though our fund will go into deficit. It needs topping up to meet what we calculate to be the obligations."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If things go better and the fund performs well, due to successful investment managers, they may be able to say "We are running into an ever healthier surplus. We are now out-performing our existing obligations and it is possible to consider an improvement in the pensions benefits." The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South got himself into a horrific rage about what would happen if there were under-performance, a change in the actuarial performance, and the pensions expectations of members could not be matched. That could be said about the pension funds of ICI, British Leyland, British Steel or any funded occupational fund in the country. If a fund is massively under-performing and the actuarial assumptions first made for it become incorrect, the managers start facing alternatives. In theory, there are alternatives, such as reducing benefits or raising contributions. In practice, the managers top up. Unless an employer is going bust—some come near to being driven bust by the pensions contributions and topping up that they are expected to provide in inflationary times—he is saddled with the obligation to top up because it is their pension fund. That is the situation
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2012</span>
now. But so long as they are well-run, solvent pension funds—and in practice, there has not been any disastrous series of collapses of pension funds or benefits being reduced—so long as they have the right actuaries and continue to manage their affairs with prudence, constantly checking on the state of the fund and making the right adjustments when the need occurs, the pensioners will have nothing to worry about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I explain to the Parliamentary Secretary where we differ? The comparison with ICI applies in relation to the funded part of the British Rail scheme. To the extent that the old funding process, which is now being wiped out, gave a greater control over the totality of the funding, his arguments have weight. That is one reason why we believe that the funding arrangement was to the advantage of the schemes, because more of it was within their control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under a system in which a single set of actuarial assumptions is made by those responsible for running the fund and paying out the money, there is a better chance of its being right than under a system in which one set of actuarial assumptions is made by the fund and another by the Government Acturary, who will make the final determination. Everyone will be watching to see what the Government Actuary's guess will be on price inflation. He will therefore be under constant pressure to keep his figures down. In those circumstances, we shall almost certainly build into the pension funds actuarial disadvantages not faced by ICI or the electricity supply industry pension fund, to mention a very prosperous public sector fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But that very Government Actuary, who will be under this dreadful pressure not to follow his genuine actuarial judgment but to underplay the liability, made the final determination of the funding under the 1974 Act.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2013</span>
the same. It will be determined by the Government Actuary. The funds were to be given that huge block of money and they were then on their own. That is exactly what the Bill does, but on a different scale. Indeed, one may argue that the scale was greater under the 1974 Act than it is under the Bill, because the whole responsibility for the pensions entitlement was to rest upon the scheme managers, given that large block of money which on a once-and-for-all basis the Government Actuary had calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is exactly the situation that I have just described. If over the same years as they steadily acquired their money, from 1984 onwards, as they went on facing those 80-year extending obligations to historic pensioners, their fund outperformed the historic obligations, they would have a surplus, but if it underperformed or if the nature of the obligations were changed by management decisions as they increased, it would fall to the managers of the fund to realise that that was happening, and it would fall upon the board as a liability. The whole basis of the 1974 settlement was that the pensions remained the board's responsibility, and it was receiving once-and-for-all assistance with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are stepping in because the bill is becoming ludicrous, following the 1974 assumptions in the short term. A total of £1,200 million pounds is about to be paid into the fund. As I said this morning, the attempt to build up a fund by instalments is proving a colossal burden in a time of high inflation. Therefore, the pension position is still only part funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1974 Act envisaged a total funding. All that we are trying to do in the Bill is to determine once and for all where the division should be in the future between the funded and the unfunded proportions of scheme obligations. For the funded proportion it will continue to be the sole responsibility of the management of the fund to look after the board's legal liabilities. For the unfunded proportion we shall consistently meet the costs as they emerge. We accept that we shall no longer be providing the funds that would have given the capacity to earn the investment to pay for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no difference in principle between that and the 1974 settlement. The amendment seeks to make an advance. It seeks to introduce what British Rail—and those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2014</span>
pressing the amendments—would no doubt have regarded as an advantageous addition to the 1974 arrangements. If the actuarial assumptions proved to be to the disadvantage of British Rail the amendment would ensure that they would continually be revised. That prospect was rejected at the time of the 1974 settlement. I reject it on this occasion. It would be an addition to that burden which we accept properly falls upon Government as a result of the 1974 settlement. In fact it would amount to the Government doing what some Labour hon. Members and no doubt some members of the pension schemes believe has been done already. It would amount to the Government taking on complete responsibility for the pensions and guaranteeing their payment regardless of the role of the board and its managers. Labour Members nod in assent, so I assume that I have described their position correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not what the 1974 Act did. The amendments would effectively amend the previous Act. They would change the present situation. Under the 1974 Act there was no liability on the Government to produce more money if the £1,200 million proved inadequate. We are back in the territory covered by the first amendment we discussed this morning. Opposition hon. Members are trying to extend the Government's liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues is not what the pensioners are to receive. Pensioners receive what the rules provide. The only dispute is whether the Government or British Rail is to pay. The Opposition are saying that we should take the opportunity to make the 1980 settlement more advantageous to British Rail than that of 1974. They want to shove onto the Government a continuing responsibility to provide for future eventualities and emerging pensions obligations such as would never have existed under the former arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by explaining why I think that the Labour Government were wrong—I mean right. I am sorry—I have become so used to saying that the previous Government were wrong. Let me explain why I think that they were right to exlude the idea of a continuing obligation. If the Labour Government had accepted amendments equivalent to those now being proposed they would have decided to allow for constant review thereafter of the burden that the Government should accept and of the actuarial assessments,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1093">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2015</span>
as events unfolded. By doing that they would have relieved the investment managers of the fund of their normal and proper responsibility for the performance of the fund. Nothing that I have said is intended as criticism of the present management of the fund. My confidence in that management is one reason why I say that there are no grounds for fear about the provision for present pensions. Nevertheless, if one accepted a commitment to constant review either of the lump sums payable under the 1974 Act or of our share, our unfunded proportion under the Bill, that would mean that it would not really matter to the investment managers how well the investments performed, because if they did not get the best return out of their investments, and the investments under-performed, that would result in a constant reassessment of the Government's actuarial assumptions and the Government would pick up the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that the investments will under-perform. The fund management has an unusual investment policy and appears to be collecting fine arts on a scale which is not customary in the pension world, but that is not a matter for me or the Government. Nevertheless, it is not right now, any more than it was in 1974, for the Government to pick up an obligation which takes responsibility from the investment fund managers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nature of the obligations is in part in the hands of the employer and the board. Management decisions can still vary the nature of the historic pensions obligations. They can carry on making refinements to those pension obligations and may even give rises occasionally in the course of wage and salary negotiations each year which could enlarge the obligations. It is wrong for Government to take over an open-ended commitment to keep revising the actuarial assumptions, so that if management decisions by the board enlarge the nature of the obligations it is assumed that the Government pick up the bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the Parliamentary Secretary agree that it is unfair to consider this amendment as allowing a reopening only in the event of the funding section of the funds not performing sufficiently well? It also allows the Minister to reopen if the funded proportion produced more. It allows both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2016</span>
Should not the Parliamentary Secretary, as a member of a Conservative Government, consider the case—highly unlikely, I admit—of his Government's economic policy succeeding? It is just possible in this uncertain world that the Government's economic policy could succeed, the inflation rate drop and investments bring a much bigger return. If so, the funded proportion might provide much more than the proportion indicated by the current actuarial assessment. The Parliamentary Secretary's proposition would then lose the taxpayer a lot of money. Surely a Conservative Minister will not allow to go through a proposition which could cost the British taxpayer a lot of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a tempting proposition. One moment I am being attacked for allying myself with the Treasury which is going to minimise its obligations and rob the pensioners of their rights, and the next moment the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness is pointing out to me that a windfall is possibly in prospect for the Treasury and great sums of money could come to them if I accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What it boils down to is that the Opposition want the Government to step into the responsibilities of the fund managers and of the board. That, of course, means that the Government would share in any gains and losses. What we want to do is what the Government wanted to do in 1974—stand behind the board to the extent that they cannot have an opportunity of funding, but otherwise leave the board and the fund their obligations to meet the funded proportion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that there are two sides. I accept that. If the funded proportion out-performs the obligations under the unfunded proportion, there will be a surplus which does not go to the Treasury but would properly go to the improvement of benefits. If the unfunded proportion fails to perform in line with the obligations, or if the board increases the benefits so that more money must be found it is for the board to find the necessary moneys which the schemes will need. That is not a change in principle from the 1974 Act. The amendment proposes a significant change by giving a continuing guarantee, that is outside the policy of the Bill and for that reason I resist it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I acceept the Parliamentary Secretary's point that we should not do anything which undermines the responsibilities of the trustees or managers of the funded part of the funds. We must make sure that they keep their noses to the grindstone and, presumably, their ears to the ground, properly to discharge their function as trustees of a pension scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They may get their actuarial sums wrong and their investments may under-perform. I would not advocate anything which relieved them of the responsibility of the consequences of that. Equally, if they can get their actuarial sums wrong, so can the Government Actuary. We are trying to cover in our amendment—perhaps the amendment is at fault—that if the Government Actuary gets it wrong, the Minister would be able to come in at a later stage to put right the part of the scheme for which that fault is responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not saying that it will be necessary to pick up the cost of everything that goes wrong with the funded part of the scheme. I do not believe that we should do that, or even that we should seek to do it. However, some correction of error should be allowed for in the one-off determination of that part of the totality for which the Minister is responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that it is in the nature of things for the actuarial assessment to be wrong. If it changes, there should be some capacity to vary and review. That is all we are saying. It may be that that is an extension of what was agreed in 1974, but it seems wholly sound to me because, provided the Minister will always stand his corner, so to speak, there is no possibility of the fund's management's being able to say that what is wrong is his fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By not accepting responsibility for correcting any error that the Government Actuary may make, they are giving the trustees—the managers—of the funds an excuse if anything goes wrong. We need to make it absolutely clear that the trustees are completely responsible for anything that goes wrong with the funded part, but equally the Minister should be responsible for the other part that springs from the actuarial assessment, which is almost bound to become out of date. Therefore, I genuinely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to go away and consider the matter. It seems to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2018</span>
us fundamental to the whole argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is on an extremely important point. He is saying that if the actuary gets it wrong the Government should be prepared to stand their corner. Is not that made more valid by the fact that the Actuary is not a free agent in the initial determination? He may well have arrived at that under instructions from the Government to make a series of assumptions. Therefore, the Minister should have a continuing liability, which would not necessarily apply if the Actuary were a completely free and impartial agent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow on from that by putting one or two questions to the Parliamentary Secretary. Will the Actuary be allowed to make his own assessment of the rate of inflation and of the rate of increase in public sector pensions, and investment income from the fund, or—this is the important part—will he have to take a direction from the Treasury about an estimate of those matters? If that is to happen, it will be no more scientific than my hat—to avoid descending into vulgarity, which I readily do except in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can throw out of the window the suggestion that there will be anything objective or professional about the Government Actuary's assessment if he has to take the Treasury's estimate of the rate of inflation or the assessment of the Civil Service Department of the rate of increase in public sector pensions and the Treasury's assessment of the likely rate of return on the invested funds. The determination will be a political determination and not a financial one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the specific question, the usual processes will be followed, with the Government Actuary advising Ministers and the Government. I can recall occasions when I have asked similar questions about calculations to be made for other purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An attempt will be made to arrive at a conclusion by the best actuarial assessment of all the variable factors that have to be considered when making any calculation. I have said that there will be consultation and there will be actuaries on the other side under similar pressure, in their case to try to maximise the liabilities. But I suggest that there will be good faith
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I1095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2019</span>
in both cases and an attempt to arrive at an actuarial assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All actuarial assessments vary. Earlier I made some flippant remarks about whether it was science or art, but all that an actuary can do is to make the best estimate of how he thinks assets and liabilities will develop. He has to make all sorts of assumptions about the economic future and they change over the years. They will vary in this case, but I do not accept that there is an obligation for the Government to keep reviewing matters—that is properly the duty of the managers of the fund. They will know where they are when the once-for-all determination of the unfunded proportion of the scheme's obligations is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that we are to finish after the amendment and I do not want to prolong the argument, but certain points were made by the Minister about our position and I want briefly to clarify matters on two of those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Opposition had been misquoting a letter about whether parties had to come to some agreement. I believe that he mentioned that in reference to order No. 4 of the orders dealing with the capital. That confirms what I read to the Committee because the date of the letter was December 1977. It was not at the end of the period, which was 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may have seemed that we were arguing that there had to be an agreement at the conclusion of 1979 as there would for 1981. We take it that the Minister decided to send a letter and did not include provisions in the 1974 Act because he felt at that time that less than was expected would be paid into the fund. In order to reassure the parties about that he agreed that there had to be general agreement with them on how he was to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real point is that when the previous Government felt insecure about a provision or something to be done by them, they said, "If we cannot allay your suspicions, we will give you the guarantee that there will be agreement with all parties before we move from A to B." That is the point of principle with which we are concerned. There is a clear division between the two sides of the Committee on that principle and we maintain that the Government's proposals will lead to greater
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2020</span>
insecurity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the point made by the Minister about the 1974 Act and the Bill. He was right to say that at the end of 1986 when all the funding under the 1974 Act will be finished, if the judgment is wrong and the fund is found to be in deficit it would be on the fund's head and there would be no obligation for the Government to meet that deficit or any liabilities that were greater than assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment takes matters that much further, though on a different system. It is about giving further security in the less secure system being adopted by the Government. We cannot concede that it is the same scheme when we are taking out £1,200 million in the capital payments and interest. Clearly, it is a different system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order that the Minister may be clear about that difference, I should point out that it is one thing to have £900 million by 1979 and earn the interest payments after that period and invest them, or, as the 1974 Act allows, to be paid the interest payments from 1974 to 1979 on the whole capital funding principle agreed, the difference is this: the pension fund has the money and it invests. What we are now asking is that there should be a backing of the judgment of whether the estimate for the future is correct. They are asked to give up something that they get right or wrong, but that is very different from having the money in the hand and earning the interest on the investment. Would the Minister prefer £1,200 million in his pocket by 1986 or a guarantee that someone might pay him by that time? Even assuming that the calculations are made correctly, it is not the same kind of guarantee, and the Parliamentary Secretary cannot pretend that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is quite different from the claw-back issue. In the 1974 Act we were concerned about getting the judgment wrong as regards the taxpayer. We were able to clawback up to 20 per cent. of the capital funding if we had wished to do so up to 1979. That right to the clawback no longer exists. But it was there in the period 1974–79, to be used if it was decided that the taxpayer was paying more than he should. That was over a short period of 5 years. But there is no clawback principle in this case other than in exceptional circumstances to which we will come in a later clause. There were therefore considerable differences and the differences

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2021</span>
together lead to a greater feeling of insecurity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is essentially that if we carried on as the 1974 Act intended, the board would have been given 100 per cent. of the fund and told, "Yours is a 100 per cent. responsibility." We are now saying "You have 40 per cent. of the fund so you carry 40 per cent. of the responsibility." That leads me to conclude that the risks are somewhat less and the area for error smaller than would be the case under the proposals of Labour Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about the unfunded amount for which the Minister will make an assessment on the earning capacity of that amount of money over the period of the liabilities. That could be quite different if the interest rate turned out to be far higher than the estimate for 1981. Clearly there is a difference of return. Whatever the contingencies of inflation rates, if one has the money, one gets the return, whatever happens. If the judgment is wrong, the difference between the two is what the pensions board will be left to face. That is a less secure position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said at an earlier sitting that 	<i>The Economist</i> felt that there could be as much as £100 million of £200 million difference. That liability would be carried by the board, as the Minister said. That kind of money, when set against the liabilities of British Rail, is a considerable problem. To say "You must fund 100 per cent. of the assets if you get it wrong" is taking it further, I agree. But we would have been happy to accept the 1974 principles, as would the pensions board, apparently.

For a nationalised industry, the reality is this. Let us assume that British Rail has made a loss. It has either to finance rolling stock and services or put money into the pension funds. Can the Minister say which would have priority in such circumstances. As I see it, there is only one door on which the board would knock—that of the Government. Governments of both parties have reorganised the finances of these industries primarily for political reasons.

There is something else that I consider to be a disadvantage under this system. If the pension boards were encouraged to believe that they should have £1,200 million, with the capital and the estimated interest up to 1986—having invested it on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2022</span>
that basis from 1974—they would go for long-term investment which gave a better return. Any pension fund manager would do that in such circumstances. The Minister is now telling us that if one cannot expect so much return one will have to rejig one's investment. That is quite understandable. One must rejig them. But there is a cost—stamp duty, commissions, lawyers' fees—plus, perhaps, the loss on realising an investment at a shorter period. So there is extra cost, extra insecurity and an extra problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a final point for the Minister. We laboured the argument about the pension differences. If this judgment is wrong, to the magnitude suggested by 	<i>The Economist</i>—it could even be greater, as my right hon. Friend showed by some of his calculations—all that the historic pension fund can do is to reduce the benefits. It will become a pension fund for one set of workers in British Rail on a different principle from the funds already existing under the funded principles of the new pension systems that prevail there.

If we get it wrong about the unfunded money, the historic pension system will have to reduce benefit. That will create considerable tension in that industry. Or, of course, it could go to the board and say "We want more money from you for investment". There are therefore, clear differences, which are quite substantial because they create extra insecurity. While we do not wish to argue that amendment No. 74 should go any further, it needs to be clear that there are good and substantial reasons why the pension authorities, the board, the unions, the experts and everyone but the Government have come to the conclusion that this is a less secure system, in which they have less confidence. Therefore they are asking for more safeguards in case it goes wrong on that kind of projection which 	<i>The Economist</i> described as the art of moonshine.

Whatever our differences in the vote, therefore—and we propose to press the amendment to a vote—let it be clear that it is not because we are on agreed positions. There are substantial differences which are causing considerable concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
