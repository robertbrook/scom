	<p>3.25 am</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 229, in page 23, line 21, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Where an applicant for a PSV operator's licence notifies the traffic commissioner of a conviction of one of his employees which may result in his having to dismiss or transfer that employee as a condition of obtaining the licence he shall at the same time as he notifies the traffic commissioner notify the trade union representative of that employee".</p></blockquote>
I think the record speaks for itself. Among the amendments we have sought to move, the number of acceptances belies the claim that we are trying to make political capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With amendment No. 229 we move into the realm of the traffic commissioner and public relations, and no doubt we shall upset many people on the Government Benches by our mention of trade unions and people. Unfortunately, one must take the view that there is a deliberate bias by the Government against the trade union movement. I hope that common sense will prevail and that the Government will forget their undoubted bias in these matters and realise that when we deal with the trade union movement we are dealing with people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend and I drafted the amendment we envisaged that our new subsection (3) would be inserted after (2) and the original subsection (3) would become subsection (4) and subsection (4) would become subsection (5).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think we all accept the hon. Gentleman's point. It is not invariable and will not be taken as a precedent, but for the moment we accept the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept, as I always do, Mr. English, your rulings, which are, unlike the Bill, very clear. I want to clarify
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1318</span>
the situation in case hon. Members may not have understood. One of the problems in this Committee is to get right hon. and hon. Members on the Government Benches to listen to what we are saying. On the few occasions that they have listened they have accepted the amendment. If they listened more closely more of our amendments would be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an obligation in the Bill for the holder of a PSV operator's licence to notify the traffic commissioners. I hope that we can persuade reasonable people on this point. If the holder of the licence has to notify the traffic commissioners of the conviction of one of his employees—this is the nub of the matter—which may result in his having to dismiss or transfer his employee as a condition of obtaining the licence, it seems reasonable that it should also be an obligation on the holder of the licence to inform the employee and the employee's representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That allows the trade union or the representative of the employee to have the opportunity to negotiate with the licence holder exactly what the position will be. That must be foreign to many hon. Members on the Government Benches because I sometimes wonder whether they know what negotiation is all about. We think it reasonable that the operator should notify the traffic commissioner. By all means he should be kept well informed about the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having accepted that, is it not logical that, because the licence holder has informed the traffic commissioner, the employee may have to be dismissed? This is beyond the realms of courtesy. In the real world outside this place, people make mistakes. So if the employee has to be dismissed—that is the first option—in all justice and fairness, surely there is an obligation on the employer to inform not only the employee against whom the offence is charged but his representative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the hon. Gentleman considered that the company for which the employee may work may not operate a closed shop? The employee may not have a trade union representative. If the amendment is accepted, the applicant will be under an obligation to do something which he is completely unable to do because there is no one to whom he can address that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1319</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair and reasonable point, but unfortunately we live in the world as it is. I know that the Government look forward to the day when the closed shop does not exist. The fact is that it does exist. But that does not destroy the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) is not arguing against the amendment or against the principle. He is arguing against whether we should substitute something for that, or that as well as a trade union representative. Or is he saying that it is not valid because it happens to involve a trade union? If that is what he is saying, it is a different kettle of fish. If he is saying that there may be small firms where there is no closed shop, there may be areas where the trade union representative may not be the appropriate body. I expect him to rise to his feet and say "I accept the principle, but I am very worried that we are notifying only the trade union representative". Is that what the hon. Gentleman is saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only look at what the amendment says; nothing more, nothing less. I am sympathetic to the principles of trade unionism. I have been a member of a trade union for many years. But I accept the world as it is, and I can envisage many circumstances in which the employee is not a member of a trade union. I should not want to impose upon anyone an obligation to do something that is totally impossible. That is what is involved in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is the third time that the right hon. Gentleman has tried to intervene on an intervention. He must know, after all his experience of the House, that the hon. Gentleman who was speaking must resume his speech before another intervention can be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. English. I do not think that the Committee can accuse me—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way on this point? I fear that he may be departing from the central issue as a result of the intervention to which he responded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1320</span>
Is my hon. Friend contending that an obligation to inform a man's trade union or his trade union representative can clearly only apply in the case where a man has a trade union representative? In the same way, an obligation to inform a child's mother can exist only if the child has a mother. One tends to get sidetracked—I know that my hon. Friend is rarely sidetracked—but to become sidetracked on that issue would detract from the basic and important question of representation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. Before I come to his intervention, I want to deal with the previous intervention. That intervention in no way destroys the principle. The hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough said "Suppose there was no trade union". If there were no mention of trade unions in this amendment, there would be nobody to inform. I should have had sympathy with the hon. Member if he had said that, where there is no trade union, a man can have an advocate and that that advocate will be informed. That would take care of the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not take care of the point. If the amendment said "any trade union representative of that employee", it would be perfectly in order. But it does not say "any" trade union; it says "the" trade union. If the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) is saying that I ought to propose a substitute for "the trade union representative", I say that he should do it because it is his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in danger of getting sidetracked, but I have never been loth to go into the business of sidetracking. For the first time, I have the Government agreeing with that, which is rather strange. Nevertheless, "the trade union representative" is quite specific and deals with the matter. If the hon. Gentleman had intervened and said, "Ah, but … ", or had he really thought about the matter and felt convinced and put down another amendment to take care of it, I should have had a great deal of sympathy with his intervention. But he did not do that. He is content to destroy this amendment without putting anything in its place. That has been the spirit on the Government benches since the Committee started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1321</span>
Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth), however, made a very valid point in his intervention. I did not wish to be sidetracked, but these things happen. I have never been loth to sit down and listen to what another hon. Member has to say. If we had had the same attitude from Members opposite our proceedings might have speeded up. But we have dealt with crosswords and all kinds of things except for the matter before us. Are the Government saying that even if we take just the point of courtesy— I will come to other matters after that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order, I am sure that, having made the valid point that some matters that were really out of order have been discussed during the course of our proceedings on the Bill, the hon. Member would not wish to follow the example that he has criticised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I would not wish to follow that example, Mr. English. I am trying to deal specifically with the amendment. I am not wasting time. But I have been sidetracked by the Government. I shall now return to what really matters. Had I not been sidetracked, my speech might have been shorter. Nevertheless, let us return to the matter in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government see fit—quite rightly, and I do not quarrel with that—to say that a PSV operator licensee shall inform the traffic commissioner. The amendment provides, in that having informed the traffic commissioner, he should also inform the employee and the employee's trade union representative. The Government argue that it is necessary that the employer should inform the traffic commissioner. The Committee has heard a great deal about fairness, and rightly so, because these matters should be discussed. It is not fair also to inform the employee that he has been informed upon?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is not done, we may return to the area of the cowboy operator, who could inform an employee without letting the employee know that he had been declared guilty without knowing the charge. A cowboy operator may well report an employee in order to get the licence. That is what it is about. If, however, there was a statutory and mandatory duty upon him to inform the employee and the employee's trade union representative, there would be no possibility of that happening, because he would have to be right. He has to inform the traffic commissioner. There is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1322</span>
no quarrel about that. He then has to inform the employee against whom he has reported and the trade union representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the licence holder, quite rightly, has notified the traffic commissioner, the employee is also notified of what the notification to the traffic commissioner is all about. We are now dealing with a person's job, his livelihood. Dismissal is one of the possible consequences. Should he not have the right of representation? And how can he have that right unless his trade union representative is informed at the same time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
3.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not carry the amendment, the following situation could arise. The licence holder, having reported to the traffic commissioner, does not inform the employee or the employee's trade union representative. Then suddenly the employer dismisses or transfers the employee. Transferring the employee will help him to obtain the licence. That transfer could well involve loss of earnings and status for the employee—who knows?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if we carry out the amendment the employee and his trade union representative will be informed. That is the key. If his advocate is informed at the same time there will be a chance to make representations about the charges. The aim of the amendment is to ensure that an employee cannot be found guilty without knowing the charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen carefully to what the Minister has to say. But if the Government cannot accept the amendment, how can they say that the Bill is fair? Justice is applied to the employer but not to the employee. I recommend the Minister—or rather the Parliamentary Secretary, who has now joined us—to look closely at the amendment and consider the worth in it. Deep in his heart, can he turn against an amendment that gives a fair deal not only to the employee but also to the trade union representative who will ultimately have to represent him in any dispute arising out of the employer's report to the traffic commissioners? That report could well mean the employee being dismissed or being transferred to a lesser job and losing status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) has moved the amendment with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1323</span>
characteristic directness. If he was in any way deflected from that strong precise line of argument which usually characterises his contributions, it is possibly an indication of the extent to which we, having devoted ourselves so closely to detailed consideration of the issues, may be affected by the want of sleep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new subsection (3) is one on which the Opposition naturally concentrate carefully. We tend to be more closely in touch with the trade unions than do many hon. Members on the Government side. That is no reflection upon hon. Members opposite. Many of us have direct practical trade union experience of representing people in difficult situations. That makes us concerned about the difficult situation that could face employees of transport businesses or businesses about to become involved with transport as a result of the employer applying for an operator's licence. Our concern about that area has led us to table an amendment. Given more time, we might have constructed the amendment with greater precision; we might have tabled a much longer amendment. But we are dealing with the amendment as it stands, on the straight issue of notifying a person's trade union representative, assuming he has such a representative—I say that in view of the intervention in my hon. Friend's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only important that the trade union representative be informed, but that he be informed immediately a traffic commissioner is notified of a relevant offence. The offence might not necessarily be relevant, according to the job the employee happens to be doing, and that will depend on what happens later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Immediately any communication is sent to the traffic commissioner the trade union representative must be informed where the notification of the relevant offence could cause that trade unionist either to lose his job or to be transferred from one job to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal with the latter circumstance first, where the employee might be transferred from the transport section of the business to the non-transport section. I am sure that the Committee will appreciate that, when a man is transferred from one job to another, even within the same establishment, it raises substantial questions on the terms and conditions of his employment. Consequently, he should be represented by his trade union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1324</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my right hon. Friend is dealing with transfers in employment, and the need for the trade union representative to be advised, may I point out that in a large undertaking the transfer could involve the employee moving from the area in which he is at present employed? That leads to all sorts of complications. The employee may have to move home. There could be a loss of status and a loss of earnings. All that could happen without any representation on his behalf by the trade union representative. In dealing with that issue, perhaps my right hon. Friend will cast his mind over the broad remit of transferring an employee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central. He has helped me enormously to appreciate the full significance of what I was saying. Until he intervened, I had not realised that a transfer goes much wider than the move from one department to another. I now realise that I must deal with the wider issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I will first concentrate on the point I was about to make, and will come later to the equally valid point raised by my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employer might decide to transfer the employee from, say, driving a small public service vehicle round Barrow-in-Furness into a workshop he owns which is making, for want of something better to argue about, pipes under sub-contract for Vickers. If that sort of transfer takes place, the Committee can readily appreciate that he would be moving into what might possibly be another trade union area within the firm, or into a place where the terms and conditions of the pension scheme might be different, or into an area of employment where the seniority in so far as that qualified for any special conditions or time allowed for holidays might be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such a transfer as that, the man is better represented by his trade union representative, if he chooses to be so represented in any circumstances. But I submit that in circumstances where the transfer is taking place as a result of a man's conviction, he is infinitely better off being represented by somebody else. In those cases, a man is not likely to be his own best advocate and might be only too glad to take any sort of transfer and to forget what was the cause of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1325</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what my right hon. Friend said. He could have developed as one of the justifications for that man contacting a trade union that not only does it put him in touch with a trade union representative but also with all the many services that are available to him, such as legal services that will not cost him anything if he wants advice, particularly if there is a conviction involved, or advice on industrial matters, employment or contracts. He would be contacting not just the man who collects the dues but a whole range of services that become available to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention because it is absolutely opposite to the line I have been trying to develop. I can see that I have been organising my submissions on my point rather badly, and that it might have been better had I dealt with the specialised service that the trade union could give to that man before I dealt with the nature of the transfer within the establishment or town as opposed to the wider meaning of "transfer". However, since I have started along the line of trying to deal with what is meant by "transfer" within the terms of the amendment, I shall develop that theme before I turn to the equally valid point of representation, if my hon. Friend will bear with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek to establish that, if the transfer takes place within the same town or even within the same premises, moving from repairing of vehicles to a manufacturing department with the same employer, such may be the alteration of terms and conditions, trade union representation and other matters, that he would need a trade union representative or might believe that he would need one. He would certainly be well advised to have one, especially in the circumstances where the transfer was taking place as the result of a conviction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terence Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all agree with the point just made by the right hon. Gentleman, although he was not making his case very well, as he said. Would it not have been better if he had consulted his hon. Friend beforehand so that the Opposition Front Bench could have presented a united and agreed view before they came into the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to cover that point, Mr. English, and remain within your
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1326</span>
guidance as to order. In approaching the amendment and realising its importance, I wanted to have a full consultation with my hon. Friend, but the circumstances—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that the right hon. Member was tempted by the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), but he should not fall so easily. If I may make a suggestion, the sordid details of his discussions—or lack of discussions—with his colleagues are not strictly relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I remember such limited religious training as I had some 40 years ago, I was beseeched, in being prepared for confirmation by the Bishop of Winchester, always to confess if I erred and strayed from my ways like a lost sheep, or even if I followed too much the devices and desires of my own heart. I readily make the confession to you, Mr. English, although, by doing so, I do not imply that you are in exactly the same position as the man who instructed me before I met the Bishop of Winchester. I was tempted away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I fail to see is how I can, within order, answer a point put to me by the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) without seeing how his point is in order. As I fail to see how his point was in order, I cannot pursue an answer to him. If I had your greater experience and wisdom of how to deal with such matters within order, I might be able to do so, but I have confessed that I cannot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Openly and honestly I crave forgiveness and I shall try to proceed down the lines of the point which clearly is in order, namely the issue that arises from the mention in our amendment of the circumstances embraced in the case of a man possibly having to be transferred from one part of an employer's employment to another because his employer has reported to the traffic commissioner that the man has been convicted of an offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with the narrower aspect of transfer within the employer's establishment or within the town, but my attention was drawn by an intervention to the fact that in this context "transfer" has a wider meaning. It could mean transfer anywhere within the employer's employment. It may be that the employer could not offer his employee an alternative job within the town where he was working at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0723">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1327</span>
the time when his conviction was reported, and he might have to be transferred to another town. In that case, he would have to make all the appropriate arrangements; he might have to make arrangements for his home to be sold and for his children to attend other schools and everything else involved in moving from one place to another. I do not want to dwell on those problems tonight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one serious defect in the amendment. It is that the employee concerned may not be in an appropriate trade union and therefore he would have no trade union representative. It might especially be the case if the employee worked in a small firm. Would my right hon. Friend agree that, if the employee is not in an appropriate trade union, the employer should ensure that he is referred to somebody, such as a close friend, for advice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or excluded from the closed shop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman is doing the exact opposite to what he normally does. If I might say so, 	<i>"Et cum spiritu tuo".</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have realised, Mr. English, that the mirror image of the guidance you gave me before must obviously apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point raised by my hon. Friend that anyone who is not covered by the provision because he is not a member of a trade union, and therefore could not be offered the benefits—if I may put it that way—which would result if the amendment were carried, is in difficulty. But it is for those who feel that they can see a solution to that problem which can be achieved by an amendment to the Bill to put it forward. I am seeking to state the rather narrow point which is addressed only to the case of the man who is a trade unionist and not a man who, by virtue of the fact that he is not a trade unionist, cannot have the benefit of the passing of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am seeking to show that the transfer, which has the wider meaning of transfer from one place to another within the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1328</span>
same overall employment, might be held in many circumstances to be a perfectly fair offer made by the employer in circumstances where he may fail to obtain an operator's licence if he had within his employ someone with a conviction and therefore moved him. That might be held to be perfectly fair. Therefore, the man would require representation as to how the transfer was to be accomplished with the minimum disadvantage to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Although the right hon. Gentleman was not willing to accept from me that the amendment was defective, he now seems to accept, after having it pointed out by the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) that it is. Is it in order for the right hon. Gentleman to continue talking about an amendment which is now accepted to be defective in its wording?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the point that the hon. Gentleman makes is the difference between the acceptance by the right hon. Gentleman of his hon. Friend's remark and of the hon. Gentleman's remark. I am afraid that one can only describe that as one of the defects of party politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not my intention. By the way in which I responded to my hon. Friend, I was suggesting that we could not by the amendment solve all the problems that will arise for employees from the operation of the clause. That does not mean that I acknowledge that the amendment is defective—I do not. I am saying that, if one wishes to address oneself to the problem of providing representation or safeguard to a non-trade unionist in these circumstances, that should be discussed on another amendment or in another way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is being said is not that the amendment is defective but that more could be added to it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman said I wanted it repeated. I did not want it repeated. I did not even particularly want it said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not fall into that travesty of justice again. But, coming to the point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on how we read the wording of what I have just said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Coming to the point, what is being said is that the amendment is defective, but something else should be added to it. It is not for the Opposition to use the arguments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Gentleman is trying to say that there should have been an amendment to the amendment. But there is not one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You try very successfully to put words into my mouth, Mr. English, but that is not what I was trying to say. I was trying to say that there is nothing wrong with the Minister accepting the amendment and saying "and I will look into further avenues". That is the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea whether the Minister wishes to accept the amendment or reject it, but it would be interesting to offer him the opportunity of saying which he prefers to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) for drawing my attention to the fact that it was not being contended that the amendment was defective. I thought that it was contended that it was defective, and I was seeking to address myself to that point in so far as it impinges on this aspect of the amendment with which I am trying to deal. I am not contending that the only people who are in difficulty if they have to transfer as a result of the notification are trade unionists. I am simply saying that we can do something by way of the amendment to help trade unionists in difficulty. I am not contending that non-trade unionists do not need help. But it is right to help those who are trade unionists and to persuade the Committee that we should help them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1330</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If it helps the right hon. Gentleman, that is precisely why the amendment was open to selection. Had it been defective to any extent, it could not have been selected. A point is involved about whether it is precisely suitable for inclusion in the Bill. That is a minor argument and the right hon. Gentleman would be better sticking to the main amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, Mr. English. It enables me to proceed from the point covered by the reference to transfer, if I have not completely lost the train of my argument through a series of interventions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept that there are special difficulties of that nature in the case of transfer, the sort of representations that certain unions could provide for their members are appropriate. Among the forms of representation are those that deal specifically with transfer terms and conditions. Many unions have a special expertise in such matters. A further advantage of representation is that which arises from transfer of membership conditions. If a man moved from one type of employment to another, he might require a transfer of membership condition which could be much better facilitated by his trade union than by the man acting on his own behalf. If he had to move house, some unions would offer assistance with the legal arrangements involved. I shall not go on about the nature of the services, but I assert that there are services useful to a man in those conditions of transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there is a much more important situation envisaged in the amendment—whether a man will be able to retain his job at all. The amendment rests not upon whether the man is transferred, but on whether he might lose his job as a result of the commissioner being notified that he had had a conviction. That is a practical question that arises from the issue of notification. We accept that one of the reasons for notifying the commissioner is that he can say "I shall not grant you an operator's licence if you employ that man", or "I will not allow you to continue if you persist in employing that man". The employer faced with that situation may say that he has no alternative but to dismiss the man. In that case, representation takes on a more important aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the questions arise whether the dismissal flows directly from the legal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1331</span>
consequences of an Act of Parliament and whether the dismissal is fair. The man may decide, on advice, to take the case to an unfair dismissal tribunal. In that case, although I should not normally recommend it, he would be well advised to have the best legal representation that may be provided by his union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question whether he would receive compensation or redundancy pay in those circumstances. If it were a new transport undertaking it might be argued that the result of the firm moving into passenger transport was to make him redundant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a complex argument to be advanced on the man's behalf as to whether he was redundant or whether he should have compensation. On those basic considerations alone—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman can bring redundancy into the debate. We are discussing the case:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an applicant for a PSV operator's licence notifies the traffic commissioner of a conviction of one of his employees …".</p></blockquote>
Redundancy is the loss of a job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reading the amendment further in that the operator would notify the union representative only if notification would result in the employer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"having to dismiss or transfer".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman, given his experience, is certainly aware of the distinction between the dismissal of a person because a job has ceased to exist—which is redundancy—and the dismissal of a person whose job remains and in which he is replaced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the distinction. I have dealt with some of the practical effects of that legislation. Given time, I could turn to case law on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether the circumstances which cause a person to leave his employment are held to be redundancy are tested case by case. Up to now—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1332</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In this case there must be a conviction within the meaning of the amendment. That has no necessary connection with redundancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There must be a conviction, certainly, but whether the conviction leads to dismissal or transfer is also a condition of the amendment. The man, represented by his trade union, will be able to consider whether his terms of employment are such that if he leaves the firm under the conditions envisaged under the amendment he may be entitled to compensation. I shall leave the matter in that narrow setting rather than pursue the point—which has yet to be tested in the courts—whether a dismissal is such as to warrant compensation under the Redundancy Payments Act.
It is not crucial to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed my right hon. Friend's argument closely, unlike Conservative Members, who seem to regard it as some kind of hilarious joke. It is not a joke when one considers people's working lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The long debate on a previous amendment is relevant here. Again, we come up against the matter of conviction and appeal. If a man is convicted, he has the right, if his trade union representative is notified, to appeal. But if he is not notified, that may not be the case. Surely this is an area which can be fully explored by looking at the amendment in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that it can. The individual concerned may have a right of appeal or he may not, but it is not relevant to the question whether his employer informs a trade union representative, which is what the amendment relates to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Seeking to operate within your guidance on that point, Mr. English, I turn to another question raised by the amendment—the time scale of notification. The amendment proposes that the notification of the trade union representative should be simultaneous with the notification of the commissioner. I assume that I have to make a case for doing it in that way, as opposed to notifying at any other time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the drafting of the amendment, I realised that, looked at purely from the point of view of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1333</span>
interest of the employee, there would be a case for an earlier notification of the trade union representative—he being the man who normally negotiated or representated the man in negotiations. That would be helpful in enabling the trade union representative to consider whether he wanted, on behalf of his member, to make a submission to the commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the commissioner's decision with regard to the continuation of the employer's operator's licence depends on the commissioner's view of the union member's conviction, the member's job or transfer may depend on that decision. Therefore, there would be a case, if it were looked at purely from a trade union representational point of view, for the amendment being framed to give a longer period of notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I rejected that idea in favour of the amendment in its present form, because, first, we believed that the employer, being under the statutory liability to notify, would face a greater complication in his own operation—I know that this is not a major matter, but it is relevant—if he has to notify different people at different times. It is easier for him to do it simultaneously. He can probably send a copy of his letter to the union representative. That is not a major point, but there is a point of legal equality and principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the commissioner receives the notification, it means that the employer has finally decided that the case qualifies for notification and, having decided that, he should not delay. In other words, if he wrote to a union official and some days later wrote to the commissioner, it could be argued that he had not given the commissioner as early notice as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While there is a trade union argument for earlier notification, there is also an argument with regard both to administration and to the employer 	<i>vis-à-vis</i> his obligations to notify the commissioner or to have simultaneous notification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was on those relatively straightforward grounds, which are based in the practical difficulties that I see arising from the clause, that I decided to table the amendment in this form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I advise the Committee to reject the amendment. In doing so, I hasten to add that I do not wish to undermine or question the value of the representation that a trade union
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1334</span>
could, in appropriate circumstances, give a member faced with a conviction recorded against him and the possible loss of his job. Most trade union members in that predicament would turn to their trade union representative and hope for his assistance. I accept that most of them would benefit from doing so. Therefore there is no question of resisting what the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have been putting to me by seeking to deny the value of efforts by trade unions on behalf of their members. But the statutory requirement would be a curious one, limited in its application, and would raise one or two doubts of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn first to the limitations in application. The amendment refers only to the problems that would arise when an applicant for a PSV operator's licence has an employee with a relevant conviction. It does not deal with the question of an existing holder of a licence, who finds that one of his employees has a conviction. The amendment would have a limited application, and would apply only in the short period between an application for operator's licence being put in by a new entrant to bus transport and the licence being granted to him. Only during those few weeks would the proviso be implemented, and we should be legislating for very few cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one may take it that that was a slight slip and does not underlie the argument of the hon. Gentleman for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and his right hon. Friend, who would like the proposal to apply to existing licence holders as well, one goes on to the doubts in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My approach, which I invite the Committee to accept, is that a member of a trade union should be entitled to its advice and help when he wants it, seeks it and requests it. However, I question whether a trade union member's representatives should be notified of criminal convictions against him without his having asked that they be told. I realise that it is the view of Labour Members, and certainly of the right hon. Gentleman, that whether people want to be represented by trade unions has nothing to do with it. The right hon. Gentleman has for years pursued a policy that people should be represented by trade unions, irrespective of whether they had the slightest interest in the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1335</span>
Member believes that it had nothing to do with the matter, he might well follow his own advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I run the risk of widening the argument. But we are making good progress. However, I accept that call to order, Mr. English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would result in the trade union representative being informed that one of his members has a criminal conviction, yet it does not even provide that the member should be told that his job is in jeopardy. In some circumstances that would give rise to a breach of confidence. Of course the member will know that he has had a conviction and no doubt he will be notified in due course by his employer that the conviction places his job in jeopardy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, at that stage the member will decide whether he wishes to approach his representative and seek the services of his union. I expect that that will happen in most cases. We are not undermining or interfering with industrial relations practice, nor is the position of the employee 	<i>vis-à-vis</i> the employer adversely affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing arising from the licensing requirements which we are concerned with—despite my nearly being tempted into widening the argument a moment ago—undermines the employee's right to consider whether he has a claim for unfair dismissal or, compensation, and to call on his trade union representative's assistance in negotiating such matters as transfer to other employment, and so on. In practice, the amendment would be unnecessary in achieving the protection of members, which is the concern of those who tabled the amendment. For those reasons, I find the amendment somewhat curious. I do not believe it should go into the Bill and I suggest to the Committee that it should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always listen carefully to the Parliamentary Secretary. Frankly, from some of the points that he made I do not believe that he lives in the real world of employer-employee relationships. The amendment covers a serious probability. A third party has to be notified about an offence that someone has committed. When that third party is informed about a relevant criminal offence, the information is sent through the post,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1336</span>
by telephone or imparted in some other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Matters are divulged behind the scenes, which people never know anything about. That is the real world. As a trade union negotiator at one time I had to deal with that problem far too often.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the amendment. I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary responded as he did. I was glad to hear him say that he is not prepared to be legalistic and will take the amendment in the spirit in which it was offered. The amendment says:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where an applicant for a PSV operator's licence notifies the traffic commissioner of a conviction of one of his employees".</p></blockquote>
That is the guts of it and the justification for a statutory compulsion for someone else to be told. It should be either a trade union representative or someone whom the employee trusts. It is not good enough that these things circulate behind the scenes without somebody in an official capacity knowing on behalf of the employee. It is a basic elementary right which is sometimes circumvented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that the amendment was tabled in the interests of good industrial relations. One of the defects of the Bill is that trade unions are hardly mentioned in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a typical response. It is no wonder that industrial relations in this country are as they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wake up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much awake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman indicate whether he thinks that the expression "Hear, hear" signifies assent or disagreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any response depends on its factual content and tone and I detected a note of irony in the response of the hon. Member for Yardley. However, I am not put off by that. I will take it in the spirit which was intended. It is in the interests of the Bill, whenever we are trying to promote good relations in transport, that we should involve trade unions as much as possible.

My hon. Friend for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central made a point with which I agreed, but he did not go far enough. He said that the representative of the union should be informed as a matter of courtesy. This is more than a matter of courtesy, it may be one of necessity. First, the employee has to be properly protected and secondly, there is a preliminary right for the employee to be represented. It should not be thought that because someone has a criminal conviction, relevant or otherwise, he ceases to have rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was advised by you, Mr. English—and I always take careful note of your advice—to wait until the clause stand part debate to take up the point about what happens to the information in a man's criminal record when it is sent away.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) Traffic commissioners on granting or varying a PSV operator's licence, or at any time thereafter, may require the holder of the licence to inform them forthwith or within a time specified by them of any material change specified by them in any of his circumstances which were relevant to the grant or variation of the licence.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall discuss Government amendment No. 198.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a small technical amendment to cover a slight gap in the Bill as drafted, and I am sure no one will object. The clause as drafted requires operators to notify the traffic commissioners of various offences which will affect their ability to carry on their business. There are convictions which affect their good repute, bankruptcy which might affect their financial standing, and personnel changes which might affect their professional competence. But if we left the clause as it stands, it would not provide for notification of other material changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other changes which might take place in the circumstances of an operator and his business which might affect quite appreciably his ability to carry on the business. The amendment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1340</span>
there is any doubt and it would make clear for the record—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was actually what the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 208, in page 23, line 23, leave out "28" and insert "14".—[	<i>Mr. David Marshall.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i>—Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>therefore adds a requirement on operators to notify the commissioners of any change, any matter, which was relevant to the grant or variation of the O licence. It will, therefore, slightly improve the arrangements for the commissioners in discovering changes in circumstances which might cause them to reflect on the validity of the O licence which has been granted.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to seek some information about this amendment. It was introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary in a very brief and succinct manner. He has made clear the purpose. But he said virtually nothing about how a person caught up in this new provision will know what the traffic commissioner will judge is a material change in the circumstances of the grant or variation of the licence. Does the wording of the amendment or anything that the Parliamentary Secretary has said imply that, when one refers to changes specified by them, the traffic commissioners will inform each holder of a PSV operator's licence what practice they consider to be relevant at the time when they issued the licence? There may well be a case for so doing, but it has considerably increased the amount of work involved in the processing of an operator's licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, it is a matter of judgment. But the broad contention of Government Members has been that it is necessary to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0730">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1341</span>
simplify, streamline, make easier, and wipe away the bureaucracy and red tape attached to the licensing system in so far as is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were discussing the objectives of the Bill under clause 1, I remember that one of them was to make it easier to obtain licences. This amendment does not fit in with the spirit of that sort of approach. As that objective is not considered by the Minister, to be appropriate to this amendment, will he require the traffic commissioner, in granting any licence, to say what were the relevant factors when there is a variation? Presumably, on any variation of the conditions, another set of relevant factors goes out to the operator—factors relevant to the variation which were not relevant to the original granting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is that so? If it is so, how are the traffic commissioners governed on this matter? Is it held that they will be governed by the terms of the amendment, or is there some directive mechanism which ensures that the traffic commissioners perform in that way? Those seem to me to be the most immediate questions apparent on a quick reading of this in conjunction with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot believe that this amendment is coming from the Government. Over the years, I have heard Conservative Oppositions in this House give the traffic commissioners a sustained pasting. In the amendment they seek to give the traffic commissioners even more powers than they have now—and they are enough, goodness knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) is not in his place. We have had some spirited interventions from him from time to time. There is a number of matters in which I have affinity with him. He will not be flattered to hear that. Nevertheless, sometimes he interjects with a welcome bravura style. I hope that one of these days he will cut loose even if it is only to slate us. We shall be pleased to listen to him. I hope for his support on this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in the debate, I saw the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) nodding his head at some of the things I said about the traffic commissioners. Quite clearly, he suffers from some of the depradations
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1342</span>
of these people. Either he has had personal experience or knows them at second hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment gives the traffic commissioners extra powers. Some of the commissioners are Napoleons. Make no mistake about that. How hon. Members can sit there and see that done is beyond me. If they swallow this Government amendment, they will swallow anything. I hope that they will speak out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary has said that the traffic commissioners are part of the Government. I said at the time that it was a Freudian slip. It was quite significant. Let us look at the text of the amendment. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Traffic commissioners on granting or varying a PSV operator's licence, or at any time thereafter, may require the holder of the licence to inform them forthwith".</p></blockquote>
You cannot have anything more peremptory than that, Mr. English. I thought that that language had disappeared with the Romans. But it has not. It is in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not say: "If the traffic commissioners have reasonable grounds for suspicion that there is any material change". They do not have to have any suspicions at all. They can ask the holder of the licence to inform them at any time that suits them. That means that they can make a request as many times during the years as they like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that many of the traffic commissioners are diplomatic, work with finesse, put forward all the normal courtesies and are quite used to the normal currency of public life and communication. But the amendment gives them the power to demand this in whatever way they like. The words used are "at any time". The words are not "at a time when they reasonably think that there is something to be found out"—they can make a demand and the word used is "forthwith".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Government Members are satisfied with that we are certainly not satisfied on this side of the Committee, and we shall oppose the amendment. We hear many arguments from Conservative hon. Members about bureaucracy. The word "bureaucracy" comes from "bureau"—a man at a desk, but it is usually employed as a term of abuse in political life and Conservative Members make great play with the word and what it connotes. If you can tell me that the amendment does
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0731">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1343</span>
not mean form-filling, bureaucracy and all that goes with that, I stand to be corrected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have told the hon. Gentleman before that he must not drag the Chair into these matters. I have no intention of telling him that or of telling him the opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what that stricture means, Mr. English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to "You", and that means me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. English. I used that word in the heat of the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is dangerous because the traffic commissioners already have enough powers as matters stand. I noticed that the Parliamentary Secretary skated over the argument. He said that they did not have enough power and that tins filled a gap. I would like to hear of what gap is filled that could not be filled by the powers provided in the rest of the clause. I urge my right hon. Friends to join me in emphatically rejecting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) will not misunderstand me when I say that at this hour of the morning he becomes irresistible. I am very attracted by the argument he put. But I must tell him that I think he flatters himself when he assumes that, at 5 am when he sees an hon. Member on the opposite side of the Committee from him nodding his head, he is nodding in agreement with the arguments he puts forward. It is more likely to be some other reaction than agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I meant what I said about finding some of the points made by the hon. Member for Ipswich to be valid. I find the amendment to be expressed in remarkably wide terms. I do not agree with the strictures that the hon. Gentleman addressed to traffic commissioners as being little Napoleons; that is a gross exaggeration. I feel sure that traffic commissoners would not misuse the powers the amendment seeks to give them. There seems to be a case for a requirement for the holding of PSV operators' licences to be the notification of material changes, but if that is so, I should have thought that it should be a basic condition of all licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1344</span>
I presume that it is present as a condition of contract, and I cannot see why it should be necessary for a traffic commissioner to have such wide-ranging powers which give him basic discretion to determine ahead of the event what material changes that are relevant should be notified to him should these circumstances arise. In an insurance contract it is a continuing condition of the contract that one notifies any material change of circumstance. If one does not do that, the contract ceases to be valid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that it could be a continuing requirement here that any significant material change should be notified. Indeed, I suspect that there are other aspects of this legislation which would require notification. If a person ceases to fulfil certain of the conditions, he would probably be in breach in one respect or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the phraseology of this amendment very wide. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend could give a little more justification for it. Or perhaps he can even be persuaded that it is indeed rather too widely drawn and should be looked at again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No more requirements will be forthcoming in addition to the proposed amendment. There are no regulations or anything of that kind to follow. I think that the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) was inquiring about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly not the intention to increase the amount of bureaucracy which surrounds an ordinary application for a licence. That bureaucracy might be increased if we tried to extend the range of matters of which notification had to follow in the case of every licence. My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) said that that might be a better way of going about it, but it would result in producing a list designed to cover every eventuality in every case. In most cases, all those matters would probably be unnecessary additions to those already covered in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the best way of dealing with the purpose of the amendment is to give an example of the kind of situation that one has in mind. An application for a licence might in part turn upon a particular arrangement for maintenance of vehicles which the operator proposes to make. It may be a contract that he has entered into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1345</span>
with a particular contractor to carry out maintenance of the vehicles. In such cases, it would be appropriate at the time of granting the licence for the commissioners to require that they should be notified if any material change occurred in those maintenance arrangements—so that there could be a fairly informal request, probably confirmed in writing, that if that contract for maintenance of vehicles were to fall through, the traffic commissioners would be notified of that and of whatever alternative arrangements the licence holder proposed to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement would have to be made by the traffic commissioners at the time of granting or varying the licence. It would not suddenly come out of the blue thereafter. Presumably the commissioners would make such a requirement when some</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>5 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. You will recall that not very long ago in our proceedings the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) raised with you the question of whether the vote has to follow the voice in Committee. You advised us that that it had. If I heard aright his remarks on the last amendment, he spoke against it. But his vote did not follow that. To be fair to him, his vote did not go the other way either. He did not follow, he stood still. May we have your advice on the problem, Mr. English? Is the requirement of order that one can follow in certain circumstances and stand still in others? Or does the advice you gave us before imply that in order to follow one has to cast a vote as opposed to recording a "no vote"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1346</span>
	<p>particular feature of the application seemed to them significant enough to justify a specific requirement that they should be told of any change.</p>
	<p>The amendment covers that eventuality. It slightly extends the powers already in the Bill, but I suggest that it is a worthwhile extension of the traffic commissioners' present powers. As I said in moving the amendment, it would put the commissioners in a better position to have full information on matters which might affect the validity of the operator's licence that they are granting.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take amendment No. 237, in page 24, line 23, leave out "without reasonable excuse" and insert "knowingly".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments. We find ourselves rather puzzled by the provision. I refer the Committee back to our consideration of clause 15(9)(	<i>a</i>). We had considerable discussion about clause 15(10) and 16(6) about what was known to the initiated as the "due diligence" clause. It modified the penalty clauses that came before it. Clause 15(9)(	<i>a</i>) uses the word "knowingly". Clarity and precision are qualities that we always aim for in legislation. We feel that it is altogether clearer and more precise to use the word "knowingly" as specified in amendments Nos. 228 and 237.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Knowingly" seemed a fairly concise and well known term. At the request of my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friends, I have been checking on various definitions. The definition of "knowingly" in the Oxford English Dictionary is "intelligently, consciously and intentionally". Those are precise terms which we can all appreciate. But when one turns to the concept conveyed by the word "excuse"
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0733">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1347</span>
qualified by the word "reasonable" one moves into an area of far less clarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same source defines "excuse" as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That which is offered as a reason for being excused",</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"a plea in extenuation of an offence",</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"a plea for release from a duty, obligation etc.",</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"That which serves to excuse, or which tends to extenuate"</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"a cause, reason or ground for excuse".</p></blockquote>
If one attempts to qualify any of those definitions with the word "reasonable", one will find oneself in some difficulty in being precise. I shall not attempt to burden the Committee with both pages of the 	<i>Oxford English Dictionary.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that not all stem from the fact those definitions are very tautological?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I was about to point out. If we talk about "excuse" and 'reasonableness", we find an extremely tautological definition in the dictionary. "Reason" and "excused" both appear in the definition of the word "excuse".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman remind me again of the definition he gave for "knowingly"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The definition I gave for the word "knowingly" culled from the 	<i>Oxford English Dictionary;</i> was "intelligently, consciously and intentionally". It was not the 	<i>Concise Oxford Dictionary;</i> it was the full one. Were I wealthy it would be my ambition to own one myself rather than look it up in the House of Commons Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we attempt to qualify "excuse"—I accept entirely the point of view expressed by the right hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) that all the definitions in even as distinguished a source as the 	<i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> of the word "excuse" are tautological—with "reasonable", we find ourselves in difficulties. The definitions of "reasonable" tend towards being unreasonable because they are so wide-ranging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in my hon. Friend's definition. I happened to be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1348</span>
looking through the Road Traffic Act 1978 and "knowingly" is a word I noticed when looking for information for further amendments. Based on court judgments "knowingly" is defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is authority for saying that where a person deliberately refrains from making inquiries, the results of which he might not care to have, this constitutes in law actual knowledge of the fact in question".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that that definition makes it somewhat clearer. After going through many cases, I found the further definition:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The word 'knows' was held to bear its ordinary meaning and was not to be construed as 'ought to have known'."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not claim, even with the help of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), that enlightenment has dawned any more than dawn has dawned outside this Committee Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the definition of "reasonable". find them rather odd and tautological, no doubt to the pleasure of the discerning right hon. Member for Worthing. The first modern definition of "reasonable" is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Agreeable to reason; not irrational, absurd or ridiculous."</p></blockquote>
That is a curious word to qualify "excuse". A further definition is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Of a fair, average or considerable amount"—</p></blockquote>
which does not sound very promising—or,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Of such amount, size, number, etc., as is judged to be appropriate or suitable to the circumstances or purpose".</p></blockquote>
Basically, one will get somebody giving a reason which will excuse them which is suitable or appropriate to the purpose. In other words, if we leave these imprecise phrases in, we are saying that the person concerned is a person "without reasonable excuse" who is obliged to find a "reasonable excuse". A "reasonable excuse" would be one that satisfied the person he is trying to satisfy. We are back to the tautology referred to earlier by the right hon. Member for Worthing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, there seems to be a great deal of imprecision. Without the assistance of the estimable people who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0734">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1349</span>
advise the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, I have not had time to find out whether the phrase "reasonable excuse" is commonly found in present legislation. I have the excuse—I do not know whether it is reasonable—that I did not have the time. But I have knowlingly come to the Committee without the information at my disposal. I hope that that will be a reasonable excuse that will convince hon. Members that I have not been entirely slacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the circumstances, as we know from its inclusion in at least one earlier part of the Bill and in other legislation, the word "knowlingly" is fairly clearly understood by the man in the street, and has been defined in the courts. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, whether the phrase "reasonable excuse" is commonly included in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fascinated by the advice the hon. Gentleman is giving the Committee and I admire the research that he has done. But are there not circumstances in which the words "without reasonable excuse" and "knowingly" are direct opposites? For example, would he not argue that all his speeches have been made intelligently, consciously and intentionally?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would argue that, in most cases, they have been made without reasonable excuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be that the hon. Member for Faversham is a knowing sort of person. The two amendments propose a word which is fairly well understood by the man on the Clapham omnibus. It has been defined in the courts and it is used elsewhere in the Bill and, quite frequently, in other legislation. I wish to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether "reasonable excuse" is commonly used in legislation. I shall not accept from the Parliamentary Secretary any assertion that "reasonable excuse" is well understood by the man on the Clapham omnibus because I do not think it is. I want to know whether the phrase is commonly used in other legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can probably help

the Committee. This is one of the rare cases where I have been persuaded of the amendment as I listened to the hon. Member moving it, which is quite an achievement at 5.15 in the morning. I could attempt to give him an argument in defence of the words "without reasonable excuse", but the more I considered my argument and the more I listened to his, the more I decided that my argument was not worth presenting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, in this context in the Bill, it gives rise to a curious situation, whereby a person would be guilty of a criminal offence if his mitigation were not good enough. No guidance is given to the courts as to what a "reasonable excuse" is. One could imagine that the courts would come to varying decisions as to whether illness or various other reasons in a particular case amounted to a defence, or whether the person could still be convicted but there should be a lesser penalty. I am advised that the phrase "without reasonable excuse" is commonly used in modern statutes, but, if it is, it is probably undesirable. I can see no point in putting it in here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only doubt I have is whether the word "knowingly" adds much here. I shall not launch into arguments about the defects of the word "knowingly", because we have used it in clause 17(9)(	<i>c</i>), where, with great ingenuity, the hon. Gentleman discovered it and undermined all the advice that I had been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has some relevance to clause 17, because that involves knowingly driving a bus that is subject to a prohibition. It is my expectation that that imports into the clause the circumstance that when someone drives a bus when he has no means of knowing that it is prohibited, that is a defence. In the other case he would know that there was a prohibition order on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this instance, I am not sure that "knowingly" adds much to "failing to comply". One cannot be guilty of a criminal offence by accident, anyway. Nevertheless, it does not do any harm, although it would undermine such words as "wilfully", "intelligently", and so on, as the hon. Gentleman said. To me it certainly seems preferable to the phrase "without reasonable excuse", and I advise the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at the wording of part of the clause that may inadvertetdly fail to carry the meaning intended. Subsection (1) contains the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"whose repute and competence are relied on".</p></blockquote>
That would seem to extend only to the transport manager. It refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person proposed to be engaged as transport manager whose repute and competence are relied on in connection with the application".</p></blockquote>
Using the normal meaning of English grammar, are the "repute and com-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1353</span>
petence" referred to those of only the transport manager? I apologise for raising that without notice. Had I realised it before, I should have tabled an amendment, but that seems to be the apparent grammatical meaning. If that is correct, matters of conviction or matters that would impinge upon the repute and competence of the others referred to in subsection (1) would not have to be notified. Presumably it would not apply to agents or other employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that. I know that he is a fair-minded man from the way in which he dealt with the last amendment. He has shown that he is capable of exercising judgment fairly when arguments are put to him. I take the occasion to congratulate him on that. When I looked at it I thought that the amendment could have been argued at much greater length. It was put very effectively by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) and was responded to extremely well by the Parliamentary Secretary. It was a model of the way in which matters can be decided in Committee. I say that, conscious of the fact that I took part in that debate—which may be why it was such a model.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debates have revealed—again we have debts to acknowledge to the Parliamentary Secretary—that two of our amendments to subsection (1) raise serious points concerning subsection (2) that have not been covered by acceptance of amendments. Therefore, briefly, I should like to raise those points now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary that if the issue that we raised was fair in regard to an appeal following a conviction referred to in subsection (1)—it was acknowledged by the Minister to be a fair point that he will consider before Report—it has a relevance also to subsection (2). But in the case of subsection (2) there is a difference. In subsection (2) the notification is by somebody who already possesses an operator's licence, and the risk is whether the licence would be withdrawn if the employee concerned continued in the same job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that that could happen only if the conviction were a serious one, but if it is a serious conviction it is likely to be the subject of an appeal. Therefore, the commissioner may be faced with the decision whether, between conviction and the appeal being heard, the licence should
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1354</span>
be revoked or modified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Opposition can be criticised for not spotting that when the amendment was tabled, but I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will say whether he thinks that between now and Report, possibly with co-operation from both sides, we might come up with a solution to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acknowledge that the issue of informing trade union representatives was rejected by the Government. I make no substantial point of that, but if it has a relevance, it is also to subsection (2), because it could lead to dismissal or transfer. Therefore, I believe that between now and Report we could consider whether we can meet some of the objections raised by the Government to what we proposed on subsection (1), and meet the Government on subsection (2) while acknowledging the slightly difficult circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a matter that has had no consideration in our debates on the clause—the requirement to notify in the case of bankruptcy, liquidation or sequestration of the estate of the licence holder. There is a difference between that notification and the other notifications. The others involve immediate notification of any change in the nature of the operation, or the position of the licence holder, when the change would render him in danger of breaching the conditions of the licence. But if he does not have to notify a change of his financial position until he reaches bankruptcy, or his estate is being sequestrated, he will have moved a long way from having the appropriate financial standing to be an operator—unless I have misunderstood the definition in Schedule 3(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that that definition meant that the operator had to have enough money and assets to run and to cover his business. Surely that is a long way from being bankrupt. If he does not have to notify until he is bankrupt, he will presumably be well away from being qualified by his financial standing to be an operator. A slight contradiction has, therefore, been revealed. Was that considered by the Parliamentary Secretary and his right hon. Friend when they gave instructions on the drafting of the Bill? If so, how did they come to authorise the notification taking place at the point of bankruptcy or sequestration, rather than at the time when the operator ceased to have the financial standing necessary to hold a licence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), said after he had moved the closure of the debate on amendment No. 229, that he was being reasonable. He was certainly not reasonable to me, since I had wanted to make a brief point on that amendment and he unkindly deprived me of doing so at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you know, Mr. English, I have a tendency to be brief, to make my point and not to waste the time of the Committee. At least I try not to waste the time of the Committee and I hope that I do not. The time of this Committee is far too valuable to be wasted by and I know that no hon. Member, especially on the Opposition side, would dream of wasting time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the clause is defective. The hon. Member for Brighouse and Spenborough (Mr. Waller) took issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central, (Mr. Cowans) regarding an employer notifying an employee's trade union representative. In my opinion it is possible for an employee to have a trade union representative, even though that employee is not a member of a trade union. After all, one does not have to be a member of the legal profession to have a legal representative.

me by the right hon. Gentleman before he moved his dilatory motion. He asked me three questions which can be regarded as sensible questions capable of sensible answers.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It seems clear that it would be an appropriate moment to accept the motion, moved by the right hon. Gentleman. That the debate be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Some 19 hours have elapsed since we commenced our Thursday sitting on the Bill. For some of us who have been participating to the best of our ability,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0738">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1357</span>
trying to pay close attention to the detailed, complex and difficult issues raised in the Bill, I fear that fatigue may be setting in. [	<i>Hon. Members:</i> "No, never."] It is interesting, Mr. English, that those who shout "No, never" are those who devote less time to debating the complex and difficult issues which require our attention. I believe that that would be true of any period after 19 hours of a Committee sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a special reason, Mr. English, why we should now consider the motion. I four hours' time a debate will start on the Floor of the House not on Government business but on a Private Member's Bill which is highly contentious and on which I have been lobbied by a great many constituents, personally and by letter, calling upon me to attend and to form a judgment on most difficult issues. I want to discharge that parliamentary duty. It is bad enough spending all night on a Standing Committee when one represents an industrial constituency. That is denying me the opportunity to represent important constituency interests. I take that as part of the rough and tumble of the nature of the conflict between Government and Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am not prepared to take in the same spirit, because the Government are unreasonably trying to railroad their legislation through, the denial of my right to attend a debate on a Private Member's Bill, a matter which has nothing to do with the Government. In that legislation Government and Opposition are equal. Therefore, if we continue we are being denied the opportunity to consider in a proper and rested manner the difficult issues before the House at 9.30 this morning on which we are all equal. We are equal in votes. That is true of all measures. But we are also equal in so far as we carry a responsibility. At 9.30 in the Chamber we will not be debating a Government proposition; we will debate a Private Member's Bill on which we share equal responsibility for acceptance or rejection of the proposition, whichever side we are on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bevan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member, at 5.40 in the morning, suddenly wants to persuade all decision-making about Government business in favour of some Private Member's Bill that might be discussed when he has been up, and keeping everyone else up all night with every type of expression that has come to his command. Why should we now immediately dismiss
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1358</span>
ourselves? We on the Government Benches could keep on till Monday morning without reference to other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is either misunderstanding me or ascribing to me a responsibility which, fortunately, I do not carry. It is not my responsibility that we are operating under the present sittings motion. That is the hon. Gentleman's responsibility; he voted for it. I voted against it. So he is more responsible than I am for the fact that we are here at this time in the morning, having been involved this long in trying to deal with the Bill, conscientiously, responsibly and trying to follow the many difficult decisions which it raises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that we shall not be able to do that efficiently for very much longer. I was making a point about the special nature of the day that faces us. This may be the darkest hour before the dawn about to break. But when that dawn does break, it will break on a day of debate in our House of Commons Chamber on which the attention of millions of citizens will be focused. They will be looking to us to exercise our duties, responsibilities and accountaability to them. What will Members of the Government say? "We kept you upstairs in Committee".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put it to the Parliamentary Secretary through you, Mr. English, that it is virtually impossible for us to have regard to those factors that I have mentioned, to have regard to our duties in relation to the Bill, to examine it further as we undoubtedly have to in the light of some of the things that have happened since 10.30 on Thursday morning. We must examine whether in the light of the debate further amendments are now to be drafted which we shall have to put down today if they are to be starred on Tuesday morning for your selection, Mr. English. Those are part of our duties. Some of us cannot go to bed for that reason when the Committee adjourns, but we still want our rest before we start upon this other debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of all these circumstances—I do not want to develop the point more because others can speak with as much feeling, if not a great deal more feeling by their involvement—surely the reasonable thing to do is to recognise that enormous progress has been made this week upon the Bill. We have disposed of 12 clauses in a week, a rate of progress on a highly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1359</span>
controversial Bill such as is equalled nowhere else in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have co-operated up to now. We have facilitated a great deal of that progress. The co-operation is worth having. We have debated in good temper, under your Chairmanship, Mr. English, and that of Mr. Dean, a number of these difficult issues. Occasionally we have strayed or tempers have been raised a little. I hope that has been uncharacteristic and a minority feature of our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this cannot go on indefinitely. There will come a time—there must come a time—when natural fatigue in dealing with such complex issues as this Bill raises, will make it impossible for us to proceed properly and we shall reflect no credit on Parliament or ourselves if we run ourselves to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that simple and direct basis we should now debate under your guidance, Mr. English, this proposition that the debate be now adjourned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help hon. Members on both sides of the Committee if I outlined the procedural situation. Should this motion be carried, the Committee would, in accordance with the Committee's order, adjourn. If the motion were defeated the Committee would not adjourn. Subject to there being at some later stage no other motion that the Committee should adjourn, it would adjourn in accordance with the Standing Order at one o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested to me that there is a slight difference today and I think it is right. I know of no occasion when a Standing Committee has hitherto met at the same time as the House has met at 9.30 a.m. on a Friday. But I would point out that there is nothing unusual in Committees meeting at the same time as the House in this legislature, unlike some. Some legislatures prohibit Committees meeting while the main Chamber is sitting. In the House of Commons the Committee has sat simultaneously with the House ever since we passed the motion for afternoon sittings. There is nothing unusual in the Committee sitting while the House is sitting and it would be possible procedurally—subject, of course, always to what the Committee itself, by a majority, decides—for the Committee to continue after the House begins to sit at 9.30 a.m. until one o'clock. At one o'clock it would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1360</span>
adjourn under the standing order unless a sittings motion had been previously been moved and carried, and the sittings motion could continue the meeting into Saturday, but not beyond, because, according to the standing order, it would not be permissible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the procedural position. The decision, naturally, is in the hands of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Many of us feel that the progress made so far has been dismally slow and the Committee might wish to continue sitting for a considerable time. You said that we could go until Saturday but not beyond. Will you tell us precisely what you mean by that? Are we to understand that the sittings motion, if moved now and carried, would enable us to go through t one o'clock today, not in a parliamentary sense but in actual time, and that we coud then go on until midnight on Saturday? Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason one cannot go on to a day beyond Saturday is that the relevant standing order—Standing Order No. 64—states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the committee shall meet further to consider the business on such days of the week (being days upon which the House sits)".</p></blockquote>
In other words, one could commence the sitting on a day upon which the House sits, namely. Friday, and that would end, in accordance with the standing order, and if it did not adjourn by its own decision at some earlier hour at 1 p.m. on Saturday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. English. As I understand it, we would normally be bound to end by 1 p.m. on Friday. If a sittings motion is carried, we would end by 1 p.m. on Saturday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now arguing a hypothesis. It would depend entirely on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All of this is hypothetical in the sense that you were illustrating what the actual procedural position was, Mr. English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood it, you said that no sittings motion could be moved which

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1361</span>
would carry us beyond 1 p.m. Saturday as against midnight on Saturday. I was puzzled by that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The normal 1 p.m. adjournment is the terminal adjournment, by standing order, of every sitting. The present sitting will terminate at 1 p.m. this day, Friday, having begun at 4.30 p.m. yesterday, Thursday. If before that time the Committee carries a sittings motion—which is rather hypothetical, I suspect—that begins a new sitting after 1 p.m. on Friday, at some hour—say, at 3.30; it must be after 3.30 and it might, for example, be 4.30—that would end automatically, by standing order, if the sittings motion did not say otherwise, at 1 p.m. on Saturday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

By some strange quirk of parliamentary procedure, although it is now nearly 6 o'clock on Friday morning, we are still actually in Thursday afternoon's sitting. Presumably if we carry on well into Friday, it will still be Thursday afternoon, in parliamentary terms. You say that we cannot sit beyond Saturday at 1 p.m. Is that a real Saturday 1 p.m. or could we not in fact carry on until Sunday on the pretext that we are still on a Parliamentary Thursday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows me well enough to understand that I always deal in realities. When I said Saturday 1 p.m., I meant Saturday 1 p.m.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On another point of order, Mr. English. You said that we could go on until 1 o'clock Friday. Does that require any further action by the Committee, assuming that this motion is lost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Incidentally, I should like to say that it would be appropriate to suspend the proceedings of the Committee for a break after we have dealt with this motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None of us would deny that at this hour of the morning a motion for the Adjournment is not a little tempting. Looking out of the windows it is the strangest Thursday afternoon that I have looked on on a Friday for some considerable time. But I was not persuaded by the right hon. Gentleman's thundering. We can continue to do some useful work
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1362</span>
on the Bill. I might have doubted that, had it not been for the recent debate with the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) when we amended the Bill. Probably because of the time of morning, the hon. Member is persuading me to make a complete dog's breakfast of the legislation when moving these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, we did return to the serious business of scrutiny of the legislation. At times our proceedings have been reduced to childish nonsense. That is not the fault of my hon. Friends but of the rather extraordinary way in which this place often chooses to legislate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be pompous and heavy about the nature of the filibuster we are facing, because we all know that filibusters occur. But I have never been involved in a filibuster of this kind on a Bill which, although controversial, is not in the forefront of the political battle this winter, and is of only technical interest to a specialist audience outside. We are now engaged in a prolonged filibuster over a part of the Bill which is entirely non-controversial, welcome to the industry, welcome to the trade unions, and not a cause of any serious debate among anyone apart from we few fanatics in this room. It is quite the oddest filibuster I have ever seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am normally a great reactionary about House of Commons procedure, but I am not so reactionary about changes to Standing Committees. We reduce proceedings in Standing Committees to the level of an abysmal farce when we go in for the sort of activity in which we are engaged at present. The Opposition are entitled to raise whatever points they wish and to debate in whatever manner they wish. If they want to go on like this, we shall do so, and we shall answer such sensible points as we can and tolerate the rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make more progress. It is no good exchanging the necessary target dates for legislation outside the usual channels across the Floor. So far we have spent over 70 hours, and we could hardly be accused of depriving the Opposition of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we began at 10.30 this morning, the right hon. Gentleman tried to discover how far we could get. For the avoidance of doubt, it seems to me obvious that we should have achieved today the completion of Part I of the Bill. It is no good going into a purely arithmetical measure of clauses.

With respect to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), we are not measuring the length of a sausage; we are supposed to be devating the controversial parts of a Bill. Some time ago we debated the meat of this part of the Bill. We have already covered the changed powers of the traffic commissioners and the alteration in bus licensing. What is left is a number of clauses which may give rise to a series of idiotic amendments which can be debated in speeches that sometimes lose all meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We still have a lot of clauses to get through which have very little content of serious political interest or of any other interest to the outside world. Nothing would be lost by making reasonably brisk progress to the end of clause 35. Clearly the new clauses and new schedules that follow could then be considered. If we carry on as we are we are wasting our time, but we might as well make such progress as we can. Because of the non-controversial nature of the clauses we are immediately faced with I do not think we shall lose too much if we are all a bit sleepy and carry on debating until one o'clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan) made the proposition that we might consider a sittings motion and go on until one o'clock on Saturday. The appropriate time to consider that is when we get nearer to the present terminal time of one o'clock when we will review the situation. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] There is no point in exchanging bravado across the Committee. We prove nothing to each other. The Government must have their legislation. All Governments must have their legislation. We all know that all Governments get their legislation unless there is a policy change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may come a stage when we have to start moving sittings motions to sit continuously until we have got the Opposition to concentrate on their sensible job of debating the Bill in the interests of those outside who are concerned about it and to prevent them from going in for schoolboy humour in the rather squalid conditions of this time of the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sydney Chapman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. You gave the clearest exposition I have heard on when we may sit and what the procedure is. If the resolution put forward by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) is now
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1364</span>
rejected and the sitting continues, I understand that we would automatically finish at One o'clock today unless a new sittings motion were proposed. Would you give the Committee some guidance as to what procedure should be adopted for those of us who might wish to go beyond One o'clock? For example, if I or any other hon. Member were to propose a sittings motion at five minutes to One clearly that would have to be discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has long been the custom in the House—whether it is a Government Bill or a Private Member's Bill is quite irrelevant—that such motions are accepted only from the person in charge of the Bill—at present that is the Parliamentary Secretary—and from no other person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to support the submission made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth). But I do not want to use the same arguments. I do not think there is any future in recrimination or in trying to attach blame to anyone. I will take my share of it with everyone else. We all know that Committees in the House are part of adversary politics. I have sat on the Government Benches and I have seen filibusters. We all know what this game is. We all know what the rules are, or at least we should.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing about the lateness or the early nature of the hour. I am not arguing about fatigue. I am not arguing about anything. But if there is any hope in democracy I am appealing to the Government as reasonable men on one point. Today we have the Abortion (Amendment) Bill in the House. I am sure that it is a matter of great moral concern to a lot of people on the Committee. It is an exceptional day in that respect. I have had enormous pressure from both sides of the abortion debate which is a profound moral and religious question. I put this point to the Committee in all seriousness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without any humbug about it I have my name on an amendment to speak in the proceedings on the Floor of the House today. I shall not be able to do so because although my spirit is willing my flesh is simply too weak.

However, in all moral obligation, I should be there to listen to the debate. I know that I could be paired. But the civilised way to do it is to adjourn the

I take the Parliamentary Secretary's point. We all know what this has been about. We all know what the tone and temper of this Committee are. But this is a special occasion. It may not occur again for a long time, and I appeal to Conserv-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked one or two questions about the meaning of the wording of the clause.

	<br><blockquote><p>"whose repute and competence are relied on in connection with the application"</p></blockquote>
relate to all of the people listed before that, or just to the person to be engaged as a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1366</span>

	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 10, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>transport manager. The answer is that it relates only to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any person proposed to be engaged as transport manager".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The reason for the distinction is that, whereas it is quite right that there should be a duty to notify any relevant conviction in the case of existing employees and agents it would be extremely onerous if that were extended to any one who might be going to become an employee. Therefore, in the ordinary course of events, that obligation does not extend to them.</p>
	<p>The obligation is extended only in the case of a person proposed to be engaged as a transport manager, because, as we agreed in earlier debates, the transport manager is a key figure, often requiring the operator's licence. Certainly, with regard to competence, he must have a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0743">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1367</span>
certificate of competence for the applicant to obtain the operator's licence at all. The last part of subsection (1) therefore refers only to the one prospective employee who matters. I am not sure whether the point has been made so far in our debates, but it is worth pointing out that wherever the words "relevant conviction" are used in the Bill, the convictions that will be specified are traffic-type convictions for the most part. Clearly, there will be some criminal convictions. But whatever else they involve should not have the slightest bearing upon whether a person has a bus licence.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have followed the Parliamentary Secretary correctly, he has confirmed that the latter part of the subsection bears the normal grammatical meaning. Therefore, I think it follows from what he said—perhaps he will confirm this—that under the wording of the clause a PSV operator's licence could be applied for by an operator proposing to engage people with relevant convictions in any other post but that of transport manager. The operator would have to notify only if the transport manager proposed to be engaged had a relevant conviction. In other respects, notification is required only in respect of existing employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be logically sound as a proposition, but I fail to see how one justifies saying that any prospective employees other than the transport manager who had convictions would not have to be notified. Nevertheless, that seems to me to be the plain English meaning of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that that is the plain English meaning of what I am saying. However, the obligation on the applicant for the operator's licence—who is liable to criminal penalties if he now knowingly fails to comply with it—would be greatly extended if during the period between the application and the licence being granted he had to notify any relevant convictions in the case of every prospective employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The occasions on which the question will arise will be few and far between. The Bill rightly discriminates. It selects only one case, that of the prospective transport manager, because of his particular significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1368</span>
The next point raised by the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness has already been dealt with in earlier debates by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport. The question related to cases when someone with a relevant conviction appeals through the ordinary processes of the criminal courts. There has already been an undertaking that that will be examined. I entirely accept the right hon. Gentleman's contention that that it does have a bearing on the clause. Exactly the same points arise in subsections (1) and (2). I know that my right hon. Friend would gladly extend the undertakings that he gave on such comparable cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman made the point that subsection (3) does not represent a wholly adequate test of someone's continuing financial position. There is no obligation to notify the traffic commissioners of any financial problem until bankruptcy or liquidation is reached. However, it is difficult to think of any other objective criteria that can be applied. It is difficult to try to devise a form of words that leaves it to the operator himself to judge his own financial position—when, for example, the tone of his letters from the bank manager become angry enough for him to consider himself under a legal liability. I see that that idea strikes home immediately to a large number of members of the Committee. No doubt many of us are utterly unfitted to become holders of PSV operator's licences because of our financial standing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I underline again that criminal penalties—certainly a fine—are attached to failure to notify. It is extremely difficult to impose such penalties if the definitions of financial standing are vague. The criteria for the traffic commissioners when considering a new application are not, of course, vague. They are set out in schedule 3 and the commissioners can judge according to them at that time. But it seems somewhat unreal to expect the holder of a licence to judge how rocky his financial position has become and when he should have a duty to notify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notification really matters when calamity strikes and the operator is incapable of or has real difficulty in carrying out his functions. If a receiver is appointed and continues trading, the operator may be able to carry on. Nevertheless, when bankruptcy of the holder or the liquidation of his business has taken place, the traffic commissioners should be made fully aware
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0744">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1369</span>
of the position. The appointment of a receiver is also mentioned in the relevant part of subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are my answers to particular questions. Otherwise, I think that in the course of our debates we have more or less covered the purpose of clause 24. It is clearly right that the traffic commissioners in carrying out their duties and considering whether to revoke, vary or otherwise an operator's licence, should have up to date information about the status of licence holdings and their employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of key information only the clause provides penalties if the holder of the licence fails to carry out the duty imposed in the clause to notify the traffic commissioners of important matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a curious omission. In a good many clauses certain duties are laid down and penalties are attached if they are not performed. This clause is no exception. In subsections (1), (2) and (3) duties are imposed. In subsection (4) there is a penalty attached—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a fine not exceeding £200".</p></blockquote>
The curious omission is that there is no diligence defence attached to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have read the clause carefully and compared it with others in which there are penalties. I think that the Ministry of Transport is legally at fault in not suggesting the line of defence for a defendant. I see that I have got a smile from the Parliamentary Secretary, who is usually inscrutable in these matters. I do not know what sort of feeling it is that I have evoked —it looks like amusement at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If in other parts of the Bill it is a legal defence that one did one's best to perform one's duties diligently, presumably if there were any doubt on the part of the prosecution that it had failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that its case would hold in certain circumstances a diligence defence could be invoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have made this point, in principle I am not particularly enamoured of diligence defences anyway. In any line of legislation one should not suggest a lifeline for any malefactor, because if someone has been diligent in trying to perform the duties that are laid out—such as those in clause 24—presumably before any charge is made against him there will be a thorough investigation of the matter. If the defendant has been diligent and the offence has come about by accident, he should not be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1370</span>
charged. The hon. Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Porter) is a lawyer and I see him nodding his head. Perhaps he agrees with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone comes before a magistrates' court and can put forward a diligence argument, the onus of proof is still on the prosecution. But if the prosecution proves its case and the defendant has been diligent, that is a matter for mitigating circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about such matters as a non-lawyer, and as the man in the street would see the issue—as a fair and reasonable comparison between this clause and another. I should like a detailed answer to this point. Why, unlike other clauses, is there no diligence defence in this one. It is not fair to attack a diligence defence to one set of duties and not to another. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at that because it is unfair as matters stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that the use of the word "knowingly" betokens something whereby one could not run a due diligence defence if one had knowingly done something? I am somewhat at a loss on the matter because if we compare with clause 17 the word "knowingly" in clause 17(9) relates to driving. It does not say "knowingly causes or permits" in clause 17(9), and it is the offence where somebody could prove that due diligence had been exercised. Therefore, it seems that it would be very difficult to plead due diligence against an offence committed "knowingly".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I appreciate that intervention. I thank my hon. Friend for it but he should not do the word of the Ministry of Transport. If I understand my hon. Friend correctly— and I speak as a non-lawyer—he is saying that if one does something knowingly in terms of the offence one cannot argue a diligence defence, because in a diligence defence one says one took every precaution to stop something happening but through accident or circumstances of some sort or another that something occurred. I do not know whether one can make a legal distinction between knowingly doing something and invoking a diligence defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am putting a serious point to the Parliamentary Secretary and I believe that I have hit home, but I do not want to labour the matter. I also put to the Parliamentary Secretary that this is not a party point and he will be giving nothing away politically. I ask him to tell the Committee why an exception is made in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) intervened because he and I are jointly reponsible for the present state of the clause. The reason there is no due diligence defence in clause 24 is because as drafted it contains the words "without reasonable excuse", which is the alternative used throughout most of the Bill. If one goes through the Bill, one sees that the combinations of words are used slightly differently throughout. The words "knowingly", "without reasonable excuse" and "due diligence" defence are used in varying combinations from end to end of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have found an exception in clause 7(7), which gives an example of an offence that contains the word "knows" but appears to be absolute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drafting such legislation one should avoid wherever possible offences of strict liability. They are offences for which a conviction can follow and carry a liability of penalty when there is no fault in the eyes of the man in the street. So long as the constituent ingredients of the offence are there, there is no defence available to the accused, even though he may be blameless in any ordinary sense of the word of the technical breach of the law that has occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the various clauses has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1372</span>
been chosen in an attempt to avoid offences of absolute liability. But in each case it depends upon the circumstances of the individual offence. The other danger to be avoided is an offence of strict liability that is vague and liable to be indeterminate in each case. The difficult pointed out by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South is that in certain circumstances the words "without reasonable excuse" can be remarkably vague. They will give rise to great uncertainty about an offence that will result in a penalty, if one has to listen to the mitigation before deciding whether the accused person is guilty. Hence the word "knowingly", which imports one safeguard into subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reflect on the point as it was made in the debate on the amendment, but it means that a person will be liable to the penalty if he fails to comply with his duties. But at least he will have to know that he has failed to comply. The word "knowingly" covers the blameless position when a licence holder fails to notify the commissioners of an offence committed by an employee having a conviction because he did not know of that employee's conviction. Without that word, we should have the absurd position in which the licence holder was guilty if an employee had a conviction and had failed to notify the licence holder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reflect upon the matter now that we have amended clause 24. But it seems arguable that it is open to an analogy with clause 7(7). We are talking about a person who fails to notify the traffic commissioners of a conviction within his own knowledge. The requirements of the clause relate to basic conditions of an operator's licence that would be well known to any holder of such a licence. I am not sure that I can find any blameless situations that might arise in which someone who knew that he or his employee had a conviction, or knew that he was bankrupt or that something had occurred of which the traffic commissioners had expressly told him that they wished to be notified, and knowing all that, could fail to comply. Anyone with an elementary knowledge of the law would know that he was under a duty to give that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our discussion earlier drew our attention to the fact that there is a curious combination throughout the Bill of due diligence offences, "knowingly", and so on, and if we are agreed on the principles, we do not want offences of strict liability where we can avoid them. On the other hand, we

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1373</span>
want clear definitions of offences that are not open to argument. I shall review the clause with that in mind and consider whether it is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 24 is primarily concerned with the duty placed upon operators to inform traffic commissioners. Much has been said about whether these debates are worthless or contribute anything. If the purpose of the Opposition is, with whatever procedures they adopt, to address themselves to the clauses and hope that the Government may change the clauses in that process, I am bound to say that, for whatever reason, there have been changes and we welcome the good will in the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary in accepting them. Indeed, we found at one stage a whole clause was being taken out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Words fail me at the moment, but it is clear that there have been substantial changes. I do not criticise the Minister for accepting the amendments, on some of which he was convinced well before he came to the Committee. Nevertheless, time has been a contributor to the changes in the clause 24, as it has for others, those changes and reflections, which we have been promised yet again, have allowed Ministers to make the changes during the Committee stage rather than waiting for the Bill to go to another place. That again has been readily accepted by the Minister. Clause 24 leaves the Committee stage improved. It has been substantially changed as regards appeals, where offences have been committed arising from relevant convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been improved by the formidable debate on the interpretation of the word "knowingly". I have no intention of asking the Minister to give us any further comments on that debate. It could continue and I do not know whether my comprehension would be any the better for it. Nevertheless, the debate persuaded the Minister that my hon Friend's argument was convincing enough for him to agree to look at this point. The Minister was not entirely satisfied with clause 24 or the consequential effect on other clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will be clearer in its intent if the reflections that the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary agreed to conduct are incorporated. Including "knowingly" in the subsection where sanctions are applied should make it clearer to the person who commits a breach of these obligations.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1374</span>
It is also clear that this clause extends the possibility and its comprehension and effects to all those in the public road transport industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary, and other speakers, said that they do not think our deliberations will lead to any improvement. But the case for improvement was accepted by the Minister in his shift, when the Parliamentary Secretary was absent, so that the latter has the difficulty of knowing what his colleague agreed and accepted. No doubt, however, he has been informed by the advisers, who sit as long as any member of the Committee but show no response when the Government suggest extending the hours of sitting. No doubt we will make these points in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the possibility has been accepted by the Minister that there may be an injunction, or that the traffic commissioner, in the way in which the Bill is drafted, may have suspended, revoked or varied a licence when a conviction had been imposed by the court, but it was agreed that the conviction could be overruled on appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has considered how to meet the difficulty. He recognised that it was a difficulty and said that the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central was important. If he accepts that, and adjusts the Bill, we can readily claim that that reflection will mean that a person finding himself in this difficulty will not necessarily feel that an injustice has been done if the conviction is not upheld on appeal. Therefore the clause is that much better and there is less chance of an injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made such a change to the clause, the Opposition can rightfully claim that we have given due consideration to the clause and that it will leave the Committee in a somewhat better state—thanks, I am bound to say, to a jot of help from Government Members. That has been our consistent approach in Committee from clause 1 right through and it will go on through to the other clauses, no matter how long it takes the Committee to deliberate on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one point on which I should like an answer from the Parliamentary Secretary. His hon. Friend, when dealing with the part about relevant convictions, to which the Parliamentary Secretary himself referred, gave us some indication of what would be regarded as a relevant conviction that would lead to action being considered by the traffic commissioner and which may
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0747">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1375</span>
affect competency, good repute or financial standing. I mentioned earlier traffic offences to which the Parliamentary Secretary had alluded—for instance, speeding and drinking offences, but in the context of a person who had committed them as a private citizen on his way to work. Having one's licence endorsed in such circumstances would not be directly connected with the business or affect it. The Minister gave a reasonable answer on that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Gentleman told us that he had in his hand a list of possible offences that will be considered for relevant conviction or offences to be specified by regulation. He referred to one which puzzled me and there was no way that I could debate it except on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have misheard the Minister, so I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will bear with me, but I thought that when the Minister referred to one offence he said that there had since been some reflection on it. He read it out as being included in those regulations, but apparently somebody had already considered that it should no longer be in the regulations. I thought that he was talking about forged certificates of some sort—it looks as if I am wrong, so I shall not pursue the point. I understood the Minister's difficulty in not wanting to read out those possible offences to be considered for relevant convictions, but perhaps he will refresh our memories on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point was the dispute on one of the conditions required for a person to be offered a PSV operator's licence, namely, that he should have professional competency, financial standing and be of good repute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary was asked what could be done with a company facing bankruptcy. By holding an operator's licence, the owner of that company could be in default of those obligations. These are distinctly different difficulties from those of personal offences committed by the transport manager or the operator himself, which can affect the licence. Here we are talking about events—about bankruptcy or liquidation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debates on the clause have been about the appropriate amount of time— whether it should be 28 days, 14 days, or 7 days—during which notification should be given of a bankruptcy. I do not intend
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1376</span>
to repeat those arguments, but I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary would consider the possibility of a further answer on the question of bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any Member of Parliament well understands the difficulties facing companies. Many companies in my own area are facing bankruptcy. It is difficult for an operator to go to a traffic commissioner at such a time and say "I am about to become bankrupt, so perhaps I shall not be able to meet the obligation as required of me in the operator's licence." However, in schedule 3 there is some attempt to indicate what may be considered as appropriate financial standing; paragraph 2 states that a holder of a PSV operator's licence should have "sufficient financial resources." Furthermore, the operator is also required by company law to produce an annual report of his finances. If that report is produced in February, it might not necessarily forecast what will happen in April. Bankruptcy can happen very rapidly, as we are beginning to find. Financial statistics are required when an operator applies for a licence. Such information might not be required again until five years later when the operator wishes to renew the licence. Has the Minister considered advising traffic commissioners about a company's financial standing? Traffic commissioners are not raw in this sphere. They have met this requirement on lorries and in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that we have done what we were required to do—we have improved the clause and we leave it in a far better state than it was when we started to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no doubt that the clause is much better now. We have been accused by the Government of wasting time, but if we had not gone into the clause in detail, it would not have been improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has promised to examine amendment No. 223. Having listened to the strong arguments from my hon. Friends, I am sure that the Minister will come back on the lines that we are suggesting. When the Parliamentary Secretary conceded the amendment on "knowingly", I wondered whether we should address him as Santa Claus rather than the Parliamentary Secretary. We are very grateful for the fact that at last common sense is beginning to come
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0748">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1377</span>
through. We have valid points, as we have proved time and time again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our big problem has been—and this clause highlights it—that the Government have not been prepared to listen. During the night—perhaps in the cool of the early hours of the morning—sanity prevailed and we got in two really relevant amendments. People outside this place will thank us, regardless of what the Government say, for the long time we have spent in deliberating and getting the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to face facts and see common sense. Having said that, while we rightly claim to have improved the clause, there are still areas where we express grave concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that two of the main points where the clause is still deficient are in the rather extended one-month periods during which people are allowed not to do anything, even when they have heard of matters which, once brought to the traffic commissioners' attention, may have remarkable effects?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. I was coming to it, but as he has intervened I shall deal with it earlier rather than later.That is another place in which the clause could have been further improved and strengthened beyond the improvements that the Opposition have made. It seems unreasonable, if one is interested in dealing with a conviction, that we should have to wait 28 days, or roughly a month, when a much shorter period would have improved the Bill without a shadow of doubt. It was a poor argument—if it could be called an argument at all—that the Minister advanced against that proposition. Again we are trying to be constructive and helpful in improving the clause, and I do not think that we have heard a conclusive argument in reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister's response on this matter was a non-reply? It was clear that he had given no thought to the possibility of different time periods for different problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful indeed for my hon. Friend's intervention. He is absolutely correct. I am speaking now on the clause because I realise that, during
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1378</span>
the early hours of the morning, the Minister perhaps did not see the common sense of our argument, and perhaps now that daylight is breaking—if he will look, it is just breaking—he can see the sense of what we have been trying to tell him all through the night. We have had some doubt, but we have had some successes. Let us be honest and admit the successes that the Opposition have had in improving the Bill. We are grateful that the Minister, seeing the common sense and wisdom displayed on this side, is now putting those changes into the Bill. Indeed, if the Committee could have met when the Government were drafting the Bill, it might have been a different and a better Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend appears to be pursuing a new line, and to have left his argument about the effect on convictions. Does he recall that, when I was dealing with one aspect of convictions on the amendment, I was remonstrated with by an hon. Member opposite on the grounds that I had not protected the position of the trade union member who was caught up in the conviction process by ensuring that he would be informed? Would my hon. Friend consider the position that the Government have failed to make any provision to ensure that the person who has been convicted, and subject to that information being passed on to a traffic commissioner, has no statutory right under the clause to be informed by his employer about what the employer is doing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was leaving that to the end of my remarks dealing with the trade union aspect and tying the two things together with the conviction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the arguments advanced by the Government on the aspect of a convicted man and having information passed on was based purely on the fact that the amendment said "trade union representatives". It would not have been unreasonable, if the Government feel we have a case—we know we have a case—and they are put out by those terrible words "trade union representatives", for them to have accepted the principle and given the individual the right to be informed at the same time as his employer or the holder of the licence informs the traffic commissioner. The very wording "trade union representative" seems to cast horrors in front of the Government's eyes. If we had called them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0749">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1379</span>
something else the Government may have accepted the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, however, an individual's right is threatened because in the clause a commissioner receives from the holder of a licence a notice of conviction, yet, at the same time, the person so convicted is not informed by his employer that that information has been passed forward. There is a fundamental right. In this day and age there is far too much of this going on, and it is relative to the clause in the wider aspect. Far too much is passed on without the individual's rights being considered— blacklists, everything springs to mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental issue during the debate, the Government having been so liberal on the other two amendments by conceding them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Careful!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shall I say good-hearted, tired or at least seeing common sense and agreeing these two amendments?

	<section>
	<div class='title'>DUTY TO GIVE TRAFFIC COMMISSIONERS INFORMATION ABOUT VEHICLES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bet to move amendment No. 230, in page 23, line 38, leave out "passengers" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"occupants of the public service vehicle".</p></blockquote>
The amendment relates to clause 25(1), which is concerned with the duty to give traffic commissioners information about vehicles. Here we are imposing extra duties upon operators who hold PSV licences to give further information to traffic commissioners. The more we progress through the Bill, the more we realise that the bureaucracy which was supposed to be hacked away is still there. I do not necessarily attack that. It is part of the enforcement procedures which we have to accept and is necessary if we wish to maintain certain standards which the public do not always wish to adhere to for various reasons, particularly in matters of hire or reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 25, the information required is not of a personal nature, such as the relevant conviction in earlier clauses. It has more to do with the circumstances of incidents and basic information, rather than of a company going bankrupt, as in the previous clause. It is basic as to how many and which types of vehicles are to be made available to the traffic commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to change a word in the clause, and we feel that this makes a difference. It may be that the change could guarantee safety for the driver in other areas, but I will develop only the narrow points that can be made on a narrow amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the holder of a PSV operator's licence, on the happening to any public service vehicle owned by him of any failure or damage of a nature calculated to affect the safety of passengers or of persons using the road, to report the matter as soon as is practicable to the traffic commissioners who granted the licence."</p></blockquote>
That subsection concerns a vehicle which may have suffered damage of some kind, and all kinds of damage come readily to mind in regard to what would make a vehicle unfit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to leave that aspect alone at this stage, because our amendment does not address itself to the type of damage; it assumes that the damage has been considered sufficient to be calculated to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1382</span>
affect the safety of the passengers. The amendment
	<br><blockquote><p>"any failure or damage of a nature calculated to affect the safety of passengers"—</p></blockquote>
—one category we are concerned with—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or of persons using the road, to report the matter as soon as is practicable to the traffic commissioners who granted the licence".</p></blockquote>
Here we are concerned with a vehicle that may have suffered damage, in one form or another, the nature of which makes it an unfit vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not concerned with the type of damage; it is assumed that the damage has been considered sufficient to affect the safety of the passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to leave out "passengers" and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"occupants of the public service vehicle".</p></blockquote>
The only people who may qualify as occupants and are not covered by "passengers" are the operators of the bus; it may be a bus conductor, a driver or an inspector. If the passengers are on the bus and the bus is considered unfit to carry them because it is unsafe, the driver will enjoy the same benefit, because he will be driving a vehicle containing passengers and he will be protected by the element of safety control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be acceptable provided that passengers were travelling in the bus all the time. But there will be many occasions when the vehicle travels without passengers. Therefore the only people involved in the transport of that vehicle will be the driver and those being carried in it who cannot be considered to be passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I realise that any unfit vehicle is covered by other parts of the Bill, in relation to passengers or crew, it is an offence to put an unfit vehicle on the road, and to transgress the obligations of the certificate of fitness or other requirement, regarding the licence provisions. An offender may face a variation or suspension of his licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Parliamentary Secretary assure us that the effect of the clause is to give information to the commissioners about a public service vehicle that has been damaged? Perhaps he could tell us why, in the situation that is envisaged, it should not necessarily also cover the driver who may, for a number of reasons, have to drive the bus. In earlier clauses we discussed the possible consequences if the inspector found that although a bus was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1383</span>
fit enough to stagger to an operating centre, or to obtain a test certificate, it was not fit to carry passengers. Does the Parliamentary Secretary feel that the distinction between passengers and the crew members of a bus is sufficient? If he wants to treat them equally it would be easier to accept our amendment and to call them "occupants" of the bus. That would seem to fit the requirement of providing the sort of safety that we are concerned with in notifying the commissioner of the information required under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East with his characteristic reasonableness has pursued what seemed to be the straightforward implications of the words in subsection (1) as they relate to the amendment. To the layman—1 include myself in that term when we get down to the finer points of legal interpretation—it is strange that in a subsection which starts off by dealing with the question of the information that will have to be supplied to traffic commissioners about damage, defects or changes to the mechanical parts and structure of vehicles so that they can make judgments about the fitness of vehicles to run, and presumably draw some conclusions about those who are running them, the first reference to the nature of the damage to the vehicle reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"damage of a nature calculated to affect the safety of passengers or of persons using the road".</p></blockquote>
There is no reference to the driver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes that for "passengers" we substitute:
	<br><blockquote><p>"occupants of the public service vehicle".</p></blockquote>
Clearly, the intention is that we should group the passengers and the driver together as they are all occupants of the vehicle. If the amendment does not have that legal effect no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will advise us on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To a layman it would seem self-evident that if the vehicle were damaged in such a way that it put the driver at risk, it must, almost certainly, be a risk to passengers and to other road users. I find it hard to envisage circumstances in which a vehicle is damaged in a way that will have a direct effect upon the driver or, to use the words of the clause, is "calculated" to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a tradition of doing it this way in legislation. I have not checked the point sufficiently carefully, but I am
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1384</span>
optimistic that the Parliamentary Secretary, who is prepared to look at the sensible meaning of words, can respond to us on this issue. If he advises us that we need to cover separately the position of the driver, we will cetainly look at that too, but we were serious in tabling the amendment because we believe that there is a specific point, particularly for a public service vehicle. A man with the responsibility for 40, 50 or 70 passengers behind him, who is put at risk or suffers injury as a result of something that happens to his vehicle will be hard pressed to ensure the safety of his passengers or other road users. Unfortunately, given modern traffic conditions, the nature of road traffic, the speed at which it operates, the road conditions, and the fact that the Government do not seem prepared to make the money available to make road surfaces safe—even in London, the capital city of our nation, people are in danger of running into potholes—we have some right to be concerned about any damage which can affect safety of passengers. We accept that part of the clause without question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we fail to see how there can be any justification for excluding the driver. That is the point of the amendment and we shall listen with interest to what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all agree about the importance of safety requirements, and the clause seeks to strengthen those requirements. But it is perhaps not as important as is suggested by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause imposes a duty on the holder of a licence to notify the traffic commissioners of specified damage to vehicles, with the intention that the traffic commissioners should decide whether the vehicle should be called in for a special examination to make sure that it is safe. The question whether a vehicle is unfit to be on the road is dealt with much more rigorously, as the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East said, in earlier clauses. But this is an extra piece of information for the traffic commissioners so that they can consider a special examination at a centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The damage necessary to justify notification is defined in the Bill as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"failure or damage of a nature calculated to affect the safety of passengers or of persons using the road".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0752">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1385</span>
There is no deliberate intention to exclude the driver, but in practice there is little to argue about. As the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness has said, it is inconceivable that there could be failure or damage to a bus that affected the safety of the driver without affecting the safety of passengers or of persons using the roads. If the driver is at risk, there must be a risk to the passengers and to people on the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, any conceivable instance of damage would come within the definition. The only case to which the amendment would refer is a category of damage which caused danger to the driver and the driver only, and which would not be notified to the traffic commissioners, because it did not threaten either the passengers or persons using the road. That is not a realistic fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, on a narrow point, I do not like the rather ugly phrase:
	<br><blockquote><p>"occupants of the public service vehicle".</p></blockquote>
It is more consistent to use the word "passengers" and "persons using the road", but I do not believe that there is any gap that needs to be filled anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment. In my view, this category of damage is covered, and the safety of drivers and of everyone else is guaranteed by the provisions of the Bill and the notification procedure in clause 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot follow all the Minister's argument. It is possible for a cab to be damaged but for the vehicle still to be roadworthy and drivable, even though it is grossly unsafer for the driver physically to do all the duties he should be doing. All that we are doing to cover that situation is to provide that it is reportable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to have a bump on the side of a bus cab which does not prevent the vehicle from being roadworthy. But it may restrict the driver or something may be projecting on which the driver might cut himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were unsafe for the driver, it would clearly be unsafe for the passengers to travel in a bus in which the cab was so damaged that the driver was exposed to the risk of injury. The damage would be of such a nature that it was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"calculated to affect the safety of passengers or of persons using the road".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1386</span>
Clause 25(1) would happily catch it and the operator would be under a duty to notify the traffic commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still do not follow the Parliamentary Secretary's argument. Does that necessarily mean the passengers? If one examines the cab of a bus, whether of the old-fashioned type or the new, one can see that it is simple to restrict it so as to allow the man to drive the vehicle, but a projection in front of him could cause him to have an accident when he was driving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I am trying to be helpful and I do not believe that there is a great deal between the two sides of the Committee. We both seek the same thing so it seems not unreasonable for the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the principle that we seek to achieve, even if he does not like the words. We are simply trying to cover all eventualities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the traffic commissioner receives a report and may have the vehicle examined in order to satisfy himself. Surely that is what the clause is all about. If the Parliamentary Secretary accepts the amendment, even with the present wording changed, he can accept the principle, as he has done previously, and say, "These may not be the words to cover the matter, but I accept that there is a possibility of that happening", and insert appropriate words to cover the points that we are making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still believe that as we are seeking the same end, surely the Parliamentary Secretary can accept the principle that we are driving at, so that that eventuality—be it slight—is covered within the Bill so that the traffic commissioner receives the report and can send along a qualified vehicle examiner to check up. But as the clause stands it is possible that there would be no need to report the incidents that I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We simply ask the Parliamentary Secretary to cover the loophole, even though he may believe it to be small. We are asking for that to be covered so that if that eventuality occurs there will be something in the clause to allow the traffic commissioner to examine that aspect of the damage which may not affect the passengers or the road users but does affect the driver. If the Parliamentary Secretary does that, we shall be on the same wavelength.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central was

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1387</span>
generous in the extreme in what he said about the Parliamentary Secretary's response, because I listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman said and I thought that he was going to accept our amendment. He said that he agreed entirely that the driver ought to be covered, he did not deny that the word "occupant" in the amendment would cover drivers, and he said that it was certainly the Government's intention to see that anything that caused damage to the driver, put him at risk or threatened his safety should be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having conceded all the basic premises on which the amendment was founded, the Parliamentary Secretary went on to say that, nevertheless, the amendment should not be accepted. In justification of that, he employed the argument I had used in support of the amendment, namely that it is inconceivable that something that hazards the safety of drivers does not simultaneously hazard the safety of passengers. There seems to be a fundamental difference of view on whether that is an argument for the amendment or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other trifling, almost piffling, justification advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary was that he thought that the word "occupant" was inelegant. We shall not try to split hairs or stumble over a bristle at this hour of the morning over that issue. If the Parliamentary Secretary's only real objection is that he regards the word "occupant" as inelegant, will he give the Committee a clear undertaking that he will come back to the matter on Report with an amendment that uses the words "driver and passengers"? That would be one way of doing it. He could use words such as "hazards to driver and passengers" or "driver or passengers". It is the clear meaning that we want to see in the subsection. If the Parliamentary Secretary will give us that undertaking, perhaps we can proceed to the next amendment. If not, we are entitled to press the issue. No argument has been adduced up to now that suggests that our argument is anything but valid in the context of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said before, Opposition Members have failed to satisfy me that any damage that could conceivably affect a vehicle and which is extensive enough to threaten the safety of the passengers or of persons using the road would not also affect the driver. Conversely they have failed to satisfy me—which is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1388</span>
more important—that any damage which could threaten the safety of the driver would not also threaten the safety of the passengers or of persons using the road. In other words, Opposition Members are aiming at an illusion: There are no such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fortified in that belief by the reflection that the definition that we have has been the definition for this purpose since 1930 and so far has given rise to no difficulty. Times are always changing, but I do not think that the nature of damage to buses has changed substantially in that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drafting could be defective— perhaps no drafting is perfect—but in 49 years it has not given rise to any specific problems and I am not convinced that it will give rise to any in the immediate future. Therefore I suggest that we reject the amendment and keep the satisfactory wording of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made some reasonable arguments about the safety of the vehicle. Although he has given an answer, I do not think that he has entirely answered the point. It is a matter of judgment. If the amendment were accepted, "occupants" would cover the eventualities that we are talking about.
I am not convinced, and the Minister should not be either, by the fact that something has been here since 1930, when the whole damn purpose of the Bill is to change fundamentally the whole approach of 1930. It is perhaps just a debating point, but it is an ironic one at this time in the morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend passes lightly from the point that the Parliamentary Secretary is taking refuge behind the fact that this phraseology has been used since 1930. Will my hon. Friend consider that the Parliamentary Secretary's statement might be revealing? It shows, at root, that when a Conservative Parliamentary Secretary starts to get tired after a long sitting he reverts to the natural Conservatism of saying that he must defend what has stood since 1930 and he flees from the basic proposition of the Bill that we must have a radical new approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the Parliamentary Secretary has made that remark, one other point rapidly comes into my mind about 1930. It was Socialist legislation, as I

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1389</span>
understand it. If the Parliamentary Secretary finds comfort in the fact that the drafting of 1930 was the correct drafting— he has retained so many ideas from the 1930s—Opposition Members can take comfort in that fact, but as Socialists we wish to see an advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a complication relating to the amendments which I hope to be able to clear with the Parliamentary Secretary before we give our final views upon them. I appreciate that he has made clear to us that the purpose of requiring the operator to give the commissioners information about damage to vehicles or changes made in the vehicle structure is to enable him to decide whether the vehicle should be subject to an examination or test, other than the normal annual test. That gives us an idea of the relevance of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1390</span>
but not the driver.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for giving that answer.

	<p>7.45 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>timing and the effect of a change in timing of the notification procedure. Clearly there are horses for courses in this clause, if that is not the wrong expression to use about public service vehicles in the early 1980s.</p>
	<p>The period, and the precision with which it needs to be denned, for notifying damage, would not necessarily be the same as that for notification of certain changes. I am in difficulty as a trained engineer because the phraseology of the clause does not make clear to me in any way what part of the vehicle and systems we are talking about. But I shall try to concentrate first on the narrower point of the way in which the amendment seeks to control the considerations, before going on to deal with the ramifications of the change or its application to the whole business for which the information is intended.</p>
	<p>It may be easiest if I take a point that arises in amendments Nos. 234 and 240. In both cases we propose to take out the word "forthwith" and replace it, in the case of amendment No. 234, with "in one week," and in the case of amendment No. 240, with
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 234 deals with the power of the commissioners to command
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1391</span>
information. I know that I have to say those words with some care because some hon. Members opposite hate having to deal with a Bill which gives more and more power to commissioners, for writ large in the clause is a power for the commissioners to demand poor, long-suffering operators, with so many other things to do, to cough up information. We are seeking to delete the "forthwith".</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 240 relates to the circumstances in which the certifying officer or examiner imposes a prohibition and, having done so, has to notify the commissioners. Both amendments turn in part on whether "forthwith" is an appropriate word for the purpose or whether the alternative phrases are better.</p>
	<p>I have done some research into whether the word "forthwith" is satisfactory for legal processes—whether its meaning has been sustained when it was challenged in the courts. I do not claim for a moment that the research is exhaustive, but I hope the Committee will agree, when I report part of my findings, that it covers a wide enough range of conditions, and a wide enough time scale, to show that "forthwith" would not necessarily carry with it any certainty of the meaning that I believe is needed in the two sets of circumstances to which the amendments apply.</p>
	<p>The first definition that I can find is in a judgment given by Jessel, MR, in 1881. The words he used were these:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the word 'forthwith' must be construed according to the circumstances in which it is used".</p></blockquote>
But this reference goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the test applied nowadays is a stringent one, as is best illustrated by the case just cited".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>That was a case where the Bankruptcy Rules of 1870 were under consideration. Under those rules, a copy of the appeal notice was required to be sent "forthwith". What had actually happened was that the organisation that was required to send it forthwith had not sent it until the last possible day, and on that case the judge who heard the case said that "forthwith"
	<br><blockquote><p>"admits of no interval of time … save such as may be imposed by circumstances which cannot be avoided".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>If that view had held consistently down the years it might have been more helpful for our purpose. At least we would have known with a greater degree of precision what was meant in a Bill by "forthwith".</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1392</span>
	<p>But that view was not consistently followed. It was held that a delay of two days was unjustified in 	<i>Parous v. Birmingham Dairy Co.</i> in 1882, which was a prosecution under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875. Section 14 of that Act said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the person purchasing any article in order to submit it to analysis was after the purchase required 'forthwith' to notify the seller of his intention".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>It was on that case that the delay of two days was held to be unjustified, again pointing to the fact that, until then, "forthwith" may still have had the narrower definition previously attributed to it.</p>
	<p>But then matters started to go a little wrong, as it seems to me as a layman looking at the subsequent legal cases that have turned on the matter. In 	<i>Roberts v. Brett,</i> "forthwith" was used in a statute relating to a contract, and was held then to mean "within a reasonable time". The matter had opened right up again. One can go on citing cases. A Licensing Act case was taken some time later, in which "forthwith" was held to be equivalent to "immediately". The pendulum had swung the other way.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was Lord Denning involved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not as far as I know; otherwise I should have been looking for an appeal on the case. I have not done the research that thoroughly, I am sorry to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apparently, Judge Cockburn, while dealing with a case, said this of "forthwith" and "immediately":
	<br><blockquote><p>"they are stronger than the expression 'within a reasonable time', and imply prompt, vigorous action, without any delay, and whether there has been such action is a question of fact, having regard"—</p></blockquote>
Unfortunately this is where he spoils it. Had he left it like that it would have been nice and neat, but he continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to the circumstances of the particular case"—</p></blockquote>
which takes us almost round in a circle back to where the thing started in 1881.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary may consider the evidence sufficient to show that the word "forthwith" does not necessarily carry that precision which those of us who tabled the amendment think
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1393</span>
should characterise the Bill. We could be forgiven for taking a little pride in the alternatives that we have put down on the grounds that they are at least clear. One of our amendments contains the term "within one week". That relates to a case where the commissioner has power to command information. I speak only of amendment No. 234, not of any of the other amendments. In that case we are suggesting—of course it is for the Committee to judge—that it is not reasonable for the commissioner to be able to choose his own time limits. That is what the clause allows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of the present wording.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The traffic commissioners by whom a PSV operator's licence was granted may—
<br><br><!-- lb -->
(	<i>a</i>) require the holder to supply them forthwith or within a specified time with such information as they may reasonably require about the public service vehicles"—</p></blockquote>
and so on. That is no time limit at all. It is a clear power for the commissioner. He can command. He can say "Never mind what you're doing. Never mind how difficult it is for you to stop dealing with the immediate problems that confront you in seeing that your fleet operate efficiently and safely. I want the information immediately." That is one construction that could be put on "forthwith". Or he could say that he wanted the information in two days' time, two weeks' time, two months' time, or even two years' time for all I know. I am demonstrating that our amendment is at least precise, and attempts to give operators some assurance that traffic commissioners cannot suddenly drop on them and demand information immediately. That is the straightforward issue involved in amendment No. 234.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a further complication when we come to amendment No. 240. In that amendment we do not say one week, one month or one day, but "as soon as practicable". For all I know that may be open to objection, too. Amendment No. 240 does not deal with the powers of commissioners, but with the time that a certifying officer or examiner imposing or removing a prohibition may take to give the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case it is reasonable to leave it to the certifying officer or examiner to do that as soon as practicable. He will have a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1394</span>
working relationship with the commissioner and, I believe, an understanding of the kind of case in which the commissioner will want the information very quickly. In any case, there is protection for the public in that it was a certifying officer or an examiner who took the decision on the vehicle. If he prohibits the vehicle from running, the public are safe because the vehicle cannot be used if he has prohibited it on the grounds that it is unsafe. If he has removed the prohibition, which is the other case covered by amendment No. 240, whilst I am open to listen to arguments to the contrary, I submit that, as a responsible official, he would not do so unless he was reasonably satisfied that the vehicle was safe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my view on the narrow issue there. I believe that that amendment is eminently reasonable. I hope that we shall shortly hear that the Parliamentary Secretary intends to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the narrow aspect of amendment No. 233, which again involves a change in time limit. I presume that that is the factor which links the amendments. In this case, instead of "as soon as practicable", the amendment would insert the words "within one week". But here we are dealing with a very different type of information, namely that referred to in subsection (1) as to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"damage of a nature calculated to affect the safety of passengers".</p></blockquote>
Here I take it that where the operator is notifying he will, in communicating this to the commissioner, be conscious of the commissioner's ability to require him to submit the vehicle to very thorough testing. He has a straight practical obligation to co-operate with the commissioner on that, and I am sure that if a commissioner found that an operator did not so cooperate he would ensure that the examiners looked very carefully at his vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a matter of judgment, of course. As my hon. Friend said, one may agree that something is a matter of judgment without agreeing with the judgment of the person dealing with it. It is a matter of judgment, but one which is based on an understanding or, at worst, an estimate of how people in certain positions will behave—how a commissioner will behave, how an examiner or certifying officer will behave, and indeed how an operator will behave, knowing the powers granted to the commissioner under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0757">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1395</span>
We are not talking about existing powers in every case, of course. In some cases, they are new powers. I should be interested to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary whether there were any equivalent powers in earlier legislation, particularly in the 1960 Act, which corresponded. In my quick reading of that Act, I cannot see a corresponding duty coupled with the power which is equivalent to the duty laid down in clause 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the narrow point before discussing the wider implications which flow from this group of amendments. Amendment No. 231 proposes to delete the words "as soon as practical" and insert "within three days". We are dealing here with a certifying officer or the public service vehicle examiner removing a prohibition, and I suggest that we need a bit of precision. That precision would be afforded by a set number of days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made clear why the Opposition think there is a need for precision in some cases, why we think that the time limits can be different and why, in some cases, we shall be obliged to rely to some extent on the judgments of the officers involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the mechanics of the issue, but underlying or overlaying it all—depending on how one looks at it—there is the very serious issue of changes in the vehicle. There is the change that takes place when one vehicle runs into another—it changes the shape—or the changes that are made when someone decides to modify the structure of his vehicle, or when he decides to replace one part with another part. All of these are changes which, on the basis of the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Committee, may justify the commissioner in having powers to put the vehicle through a special examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can see the point of that, given the complex nature of some public service vehicles. I do not need to rely on the bendy bus for this, but, given the complicated nature of the combined hydraulic systems, the electrical systems and all the other features about which we shall want to talk later because of their relevance to the clause, it must be significant that the commissioner has this important duty placed upon him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various manufacturers of vehicles specify different conditions on replacement of parts. Various operators have their own policies of maintenance of vehicles. In
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1396</span>
some cases, a manufacturer may specify that if one set of brake pads is taken out it should be replaced with another set within a certain specification or even of the same make as was taken out. He may contend that unless that is done, the vehicle is put at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore a complex matter to judge whether the clause makes clear that this matter will be covered in the requirement to provide the information. I do not want to complicate the debate unduly, partly because I want to keep a clear understanding of what is covered in the amendments. I hope that other hon. Members will wish to deal with the points about time limits within which these operators will have the opportunity to deploy their views on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give us his views before we go into the more substantial issue of whether the information can be intelligently used, if collated and specified within these loose terms in the clause in the interest of public safety, after which we are all striving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 231 and I wish to speak to the other amendments taken with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 25, and in particular subsection (1), rightly puts stress on safety factors. I have previously emphasised that it is my personal belief that no sanctions in the Bill are more important than those that apply to public safety. While I have in some circumstances considerable sympathy with giving discretion, where safety matters are concerned the wording should be tied down very tightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will always be a difference of opinion between those who argue for discretion and those who argue for tight wording. If it is not practicable to make the changes within the definition of the particular period laid down—whether one week for the change in fixed equipment or three days to report damage—one would be in difficulties if unable to meet an arbitrary margin of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to underline what my right hon. Friend said. The balance of his argument was right. Amendment No. 231 seeks to—[	<i>Interruption.</i> I welcome back the Minister to his place and his duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are very glad to see him. I am sorry that the Minister missed the first part of my speech, and when he reads it in 	<i>Hansard</i> he will be sorry that he missed it, too. However, I do not want to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0758">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1397</span>
delay the Committee and I cannot go over that part of the argument again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes to leave out "as soon as practical" and insert "within 3 days." The advantage is that it gives a fixed period of time in which these serious matters must be reported. Right throughout my short life I have always been suspicious of the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable".</p></blockquote>
That phrase means all things to all men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Higgins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member probably means by about midday on Saturday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I do not respond to interventions in the polite way that I should, I beg the indulgence of hon. Members. I am not as sharp as I was several hours ago. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] There are encouraging sounds from the hon. Gentleman, but we must beware of Greeks when they bring gifts. Although I take it in the spirit it deserves, I must be careful not to lose the thread of my argument altogether, if indeed, you agree, Mr. Dean, that I had a thread to start with, but I think I did. I was discussing the word "practicable" in the phrase "as soon as practicable". That is a loophole for all kinds of people to fly through. If we include "within three days" it is definitely tightened and given the definitive purpose that it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Line 3 of clause 25 mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"any failure or damage".</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether later in the clause, or in the definition clause, No. 35, "failure or damage" is defined. Perhaps either the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary could advise me on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take "failure" to mean a mechanical failure of the vehicle. If the Parliamentary Secretary does not wish to intervene I will continue. I do not wish to catch him on the hop. By mechanical failure, I mean if the clutch or brakes fail. That is the kind of serious failure that has to be reported to the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If "damage" is of such a nature as to interfere with the operation of the service, presumably it means rather more than a dented wing or something like that. It means that it is damaged in such a way that it affects the steering. If it is damaged in such a way that the tracking of the vehicle is affected, this has to be reported to the traffic commissioners. Therefore,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1398</span>
we are talking of serious damage. As regards "failure or damage" as in the Bill, we do not quite know, in terms of subsection (1), quite the extent of the damage we are considering, so we would need the Parliamentary Secretary's advice here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on to a serious point which no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to satisfy. The phraseology does seem extraordinarily wide. I am intrigued by the wording
	<br><blockquote><p>"damage of a nature calculated to affect‖"</p></blockquote>
persons using the road, presumably. That need not be particularly serious damage because even minor damage could cause a public service vehicle to fail, say, the equivalent of an MOT test on quite minor matters. I wonder whether it could be interpreted that there is an obligation for an operator to report even minor occurrences that put a vehicle off the road for a short time because, if used, it would be unsafe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) for that intervention. When I thought about the amendment and put together the bits and pieces of the argument, I found that trying to amend subsection (1) was very difficult. The wording is so wide that parts of it almost mean all things to all men and that ought not to be the case with a matter such as safety. If in the end these things come before the court—and the language of the court is presumably the language of precise definition—we ought to do better than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Parliamentary Secretary is a lawyer and no doubt he can put that right. When we are considering the amendment and trying to tighten the wording, we shall be in difficulty unless some of the other clauses are drawn more tightly as well. I am not arguing so much the precise wording of the amendment, although it is narrow, I am arguing more the spirit of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a phrase which occurs in the few words around the amendment
	<br><blockquote><p>"the safety of passengers or of persons using the road".</p></blockquote>
Precisely what in all circumstances constitutes danger to persons using the road? For example, when the tracking of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0759">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1399</span>
vehicle is damaged, the vehicle might mount the kerb and kill someone. If there is a brake failure it is easy enough to see the damage that can be done, but people's lives are at stake. But a knock in the side of the bus may leave jagged edges and in certain circumstances that is a danger to people using the road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Member's arguments with great care, but I am trying to relate his remarks to the length of time within which the damage has to be notified. Will he explain to me what points he is seeking to make in relation to the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am saying that when damage occurs to the vehicle, the reporting of these matters as soon as is practicable is not tight enough commensurate with the serious nature of what could happen with failure or damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the change from the 1960 legislation to the duty that is now placed on an operator is that he rather than the licence holder has to report the damage. I have told the Committee before that I have taken opinion from private transport operators in Suffolk and they have doubts about operator licensing. I think those doubts will come to the surface when this change from licensing the vehicle to operator licensing occurs. Under the new system there may be weaknesses with which we have not yet got to grips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments are to do with less serious matters. Amendment No. 233 is concerned with items such as fixed equipment which I do not think is quite so serious. Damage to the vehicle and failure is serious. However, we still go for the principle that we tie it down within a period of time and knock out this phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable",</p></blockquote>
for that presumably has to be defined by a court of law bearing in mind what is reasonable in terms of what is practicable and what is not. I think it would take lawyers a long time to establish a body of precedent concerning what is practicable and what is not, unless, within the definitions clause, there is guidance about what is practicable, or is it left entirely open-ended? Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us when he winds up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amendment No. 234—on which I shall not waste many words—we insert
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1400</span>
"one week". I do not like the word "forthwith". I do not know whether I have an antipathy towards this word. But it connotes something I do not like. "You will do something forthwith". "You will give this information forthwith". There is a peremptory tone about it which ought not to be in a Bill of this kind. It occurs a number of times. I do not know whether I have the Parliamentary Secretary's agreement on that but I do not think that it is a suitable word to use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Parliamentary Secretary could look at these amendments in the spirit in which we drafted them. I am not being legalistic about them, But the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) made a most constructive intervention. He gave mesome sympathy about the loose wording. Loose wording is not to be desired in any legislation, but when it affects public safety it is less desirable than ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by giving my support to my right hon. Friend and to the amendments on the order paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This selection of amendments is concerned with the varying time limits that are imposed on those whose are required to give information to traffic commissioners and to the certifying officers of the public service vehicle examiners who are also required to give notice of some of their decisions to the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal first with the duty imposed on the holder of an operator's licence to notify various forms of failure or damage to the traffic commissioners. Failure or damage is a very wide term, but as I indicated in an earlier debate, and I think this is the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), this has to be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"failure or damage of a nature calculated to affect the safety of passengers or of persons using the road".</p></blockquote>
We are concerned only with whether safety is affected. That wording is taken straight from the 1930 Act. It is repeated in the 1960 Act. Even then it encompasses a rather wide range of failure or damage because safety can involve a risk that the entire coach will crash at the first bend it reaches or someone may fall over when he gets inside the coach because something is wrong with the platform. There is a wide range of injuries involved. For that reason there is no need for anything severe by way of timing. The words:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0760">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1401</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
seem to meet the merits of the case rather better than the exact time of "one week" which the Opposition hope to impose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practice since 1930—repeated in 1960—has been to use the rather unusual phrase "as soon as may be" which tells one absolutely nothing. It seems to have worked for 49 years but in this case I should have thought that
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
was slightly more sensible and should give rise to no difficulties. The trouble with moving from
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
to "within one week" would be that possibly it would not meet all circumstances. For example, at holiday times an exact requirement of one week might be unreasonable for reporting a defect of a comparatively minor nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other side of the coin are the amendments by which the Opposition wish to remove the word "forthwith". The "forthwith" requirements are more serious. I see no reason why the traffic commissioners—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Parliamentary Secretary is moving from
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
to "forthwith" may I remind him that he said that we were only dealing with the reporting of damage. That is not so. In amendment No. 233 we are dealing with the reporting of changes made in the structure and the equipment of vehicles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite right. I accept the correction. I thought that the right hon. Gentleman was showing no signs of tiredness. He is as alert as ever. I am glad to see that, and I am relieved in view of the hours that lie ahead of us. The right hon. Gentleman is quite right. We are dealing with both but the same arguments apply concerning the time at which they should be reported. If one tries to impose strict times, that will give rise to difficulty at holiday times and other times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on the earlier amendment, what we are dealing with here, although related to safety, is not the key safety clause in the Bill. We are dealing only with the flow of information to the traffic commissioners, which they will look at to see whether it might justify a vehicle being
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1402</span>
called in specially, and "as soon as is practicable" seems to me to be appropriate to both.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to subsection (3), there must be some circumstances where the traffic commissioners should be left the power that they have, if they feel it necessary, to demand that certain information should be supplied forthwith. In act, a discretion is given—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. It looks as though the Parliamentary Secretary is a little baffled at the sound of the Division bells. He clearly is not used to being here at this time of the morning. I can assure him, from personal knowledge, that at 8.30 every morning the bells are tested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not make a practice of getting up at 8.30 in the morning very often. The sooner I cease the practice the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3) contains a power which the traffic commissioners can use to have some information given to them forthwith. But it is a flexible power. It provides that the traffic commissioners may
	<br><blockquote><p>"require the holder of the licence to supply them forthwith or within a specified time with such information as they may reasonably require".</p></blockquote>
That means that it is left to the traffic commissioners to judge what is an appropriate time for the information that they want. Clearly, they would use "forthwith" only if it concerned a matter of considerable urgency, importance and significance for public safety. Because of the traffic commissioners' special responsibility for public safety, they should be allowed the opportunity of demanding some information forthwith if they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (6), I cannot see what is wrong in requiring that certifying officers or public service vehicle examiners should forthwith give notice to the traffic commissioners of prohibitions being imposed or removed. Indeed, the Opposition's amendments on that subsection seem to me entirely contradictory to amendments that they moved at an earlier stage on prohibitions. Earlier on, they were understandably and, indeed, rightly, anxious that, when a vehicle was made subject to a prohibition—that is, an operator was found to have a vehicle unfit for service—the traffic commissioners respon-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1403</span>
sible for issuing the operator's licence should be informed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am telieved to hear the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) say that it is a probing amendment. I trust the Opposition have not changed their minds on the importance of the traffic commissioners being kept informed about the track record of operators on safety. I hope that, on reflection, now that they appreciate its significance, they will accept that "forthwith" is a justifiable requirement in that subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore think that we have had an interesting debate to explore the various time limits in the Bill, but I believe that they are all defensible. Those imposed on the operators allow a reasonable time—"as soon as is practicable". The traffic commissioners themselves are given some flexibility in the timings that they choose to impose. The final limit—that imposed on the certifying officer—is very serious and it is right that that should be "forthwith".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make several points about the clause, in which I am especially interested for three reasons. I shall not discuss the first reason now, because it would be out of order and I shall save it for the debate on clause stand part. The second reason for my interest in the clause is one of the two areas of looseness—that which was touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) and also by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate). It is a serious point. There is a degree of looseness in that part of the clause, and I wish to discuss it in the clause stand part debate. I do not wish to be enticed into discussing it now because I should only be wasting time, which I do not want to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well satisfied with the answer that my hon. Friend gave me—that "forthwith" seems to have worked effectively for 50 years. If it has worked in that way, there cannot be too much wrong with the phrase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Faversham says that he is satisfied. I am not satisfied, but, I do not want to have to explain why and to discuss the Parlia-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1404</span>
mentary Secretary's comments, because I think that he is out of order. We are discussing specific amendments dealing with time. That is a further reason why I am interested in the clause. I believe that this is also an area of looseness. The Parliamentary Secretary grimaces. He often does that when he knows that he is on weak ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not spoken often in the Committee, but when I have it has been to make what I have regarded as a serious point, and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will listen to what I have to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 231 seeks to change the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
in subsection (1). That is very loose wording and it is desirable in the interests of everyone involved that the clause should be a little more precise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that you were in the Chair, Mr. Dean, when we were discussing clause 24 and the time periods there. I drew the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister—I forget which was representing the Government at the time—to the fact that the Government had a standard period of 28 days which they applied in several subsections without giving, I believe, enough thought to the circumstances of each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 25 the Government then go into tremendous looseness, which I think is even worse than having a standard period. The looseness is in the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable".</p></blockquote>
The Opposition suggestion is that the time limit should be three days. It is not unreasonable to require the holder of a PSV operator's licence to report to the traffic commissioners who granted his licence a failure or damage—that is a subject that I want to discuss later—which is calculated to affect safety. It is not unreasonable to argue that that can be reported in three days if it affects the safety of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to amendment No. 233, which seeks to amend subsection (2), where again we have this very loose phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable".</p></blockquote>
The Opposition suggest that a more appropriate period of time would be one week. Again on clause stand part I shall have some comments on the rest of that subsection. But if we are talking about a vehicle which is being altered, it should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0762">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1405</span>
quite possible for an operator to report it within one week. Again, I do not think that it is unreasonable to expect it to be done in that time scale. It is a longer period than the three days which seems appropriate where it is a matter of safety. It is within the knowledge of the operator and there is no reason why he should not report it promptly. To allow a week seems to be the correct period of time to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>). Our amendment No. 234 seeks to replace the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"forthwith or within a specified time".</p></blockquote>
I shall not comment further on the word "forthwith," because I agree entirely with what my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) said. At first I wondered what its meaning was. I decided that it must mean "immediately" and I agree with my hon. Friend that there is a peremptory tone to that word. I am surprised that the Government have chosen that word for what is not, in my mind, a major point of information which needs to be conveyed to the traffic commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb --> The addition of the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or within a specified time"</p></blockquote>
confuses the issue. The Parliamentary Secretary had said that it allows flexibility and a discretion to the traffic commissioners. But I point out that that discretion is not given anywhere else in this clause or the previous clause. I find it difficult to understand why we should put in that sort of discretion, which I think could be operated against the interests of an operator seeking to run buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary talks as if the traffic commissioners would require specific information within a specified time. But the subsection does not seem to be saying that sort of thing. As I read it, before listening to the Parliamentary Secretary, and reading it again during his speech, it seemed to provide that the operator should inform the traffic commissioners who have granted his licence of the things which he is required to inform them. I should have thought that those things should be specified in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to be referring to a situation in which the traffic commissioners would say to the operator "We want this information from you within a certain period of time," which they will specify. That was not what I understood. I thought that the traffic commissioners would tell all those to whom
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1406</span>
they had given licences "If such and such a thing happens, we want you to inform us within a certain period of time". I think that it is far better for that to be specified and for clarity, certainty and precision to be written into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend's argument carefully, and he makes a powerful point. But does he agree that there is one exception to his general point about the imprecise nature of the information being demanded? That is the case in subsection (6) which clearly refers to a specific piece of information that a certifying officer can give. He imposes a prohibition notice and that is specific. In all other cases, I agree that it is imprecise and that is something to which we can turn our attention only on clause stand part. We are not now dealing with questions of precision but of time scales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I should not like my hon. Friend to spoil a very good point by not acknowledging at least to the Parliamentary Secretary, that there is one area in the clause in which the information required is precisely stated, although his broad criticism applies to the other three instances in which time limits are set.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point of my right hon. Friend's point but he has not really followed my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The precision is in the time period. When I referred to precision of information, I was making the point that the Parliamentary Secretary was implying that traffic commissioners might say to an individual operator, "We want you to tell us about this thing within a certain time period," implying that they know that something has happened. If they know that it has happened, why do they want him to tell them about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is really driving at the fact that the traffic commissioners should say to all operators for whom they are responsible "If this type of event takes place,"—I do not want to go into the types of event, because I assume that the Parliamentary Secretary has examples—"we want all operators in our area to inform us, if it happens, within a period that we shall specify." I am arguing that that is an unnecessary discretion which adds to the confusion and uncertainty. It would be much better to have a fixed period, and I think that one week would be reasonable. The traffic commissioners could then say,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1407</span>
when a cettain thing happens, that they want their operators to tell them, not forthwith or within a specified time, depanding on the type of event, but within a set period of a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come to a subsection (6) in a moment, because I take my right hon. Friend's point. I want first to deal with the Parliamentary Secretary's reply which was that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable"</p></blockquote>
was a good phrase and was similar to one that dated from the 1930s which I think he said was "as soon as may be." I was very impressed with the Parliamentary Secretary's response earlier when we were discussing a different clause and a word or phrase that was to be replaced. I think that the word may have been "wilfully," but I am open to correction. His argument was that the word was now out of date, that times had changed, we were 50 years on, that the word may have been current usage 50 years ago, but that it was not so today. He said that it was not suitable for the Bill because it was old fashioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
1 was very impressed with that argument when I heard it. I think that it is valid and ought to be applied by the Government to all their legislation. To argue that words which were current and in vogue in the 1930s should be included in legislation in the 1980s is not only reactionary, as I think the Parliamentary Secretary said on a different occasion, but is positively regressive. We ought to be progressive. We ought to be trying to modernise our language and legislation and make it more precise. That is exactly the point that I am trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the last 50 years there has been a trend in this country—a welcome one in my opinion—to do away with unnecessary jargon and words that merely surround other words and to concentrate on the precise terms that are required. I am not trying to make a party political point. Progress has been made in this field, under Governments of both parties. I believe that the present Administration are dedicated to furthering that end by simplifying the forms that people have to fill in—income tax and social security forms and the like are studded with old-fashioned language. We should be adopting the same policy in legislation. I was disappointed with the Parliamentary Secretary's reply on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1408</span>
8.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to subsection (6). To suggest that the word "forthwith", which is fairly precise although it has peremptory overtones, should be replaced by the phrase "as soon as practicable" may appear at first sight inconsistent. But my hon. Friends and I had a genuine reason for putting down the amendment. We were not simply looking for things to change. Neither were we being inconsistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a certifying officer or public service vehicle examiner imposes or removes a prohibition on the driving of a public service vehicle, he shall forthwith give notice of that fact to the traffic commissioners who granted the PSV operator's licence under which the vehicle was last used before the prohibition was imposed."</p></blockquote>
When drafting the amendment we were thinking of the case where a prohibition has been imposed some time before. It may not be immediately obvious which traffic commissioners granted the PSV operator's licence under which the vehicle was last used before the prohibition was imposed. We have discussed earlier what information would be on discs and vehicles. The required information will not be available immediately to an examiner or a certifying officer. He would have to make enquiries to discover where he should send the notification. Enquiries take some time. It is as simple as that. It is not reasonable to say that it must be done forthwith because that may not be possible. If legislation specifies "forthwith" it should always be possible to obey it, to act in accordance with the instruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore a degree of flexibility seemed desirable in the interests of good legislation. I certainly agree with my hon. Friend's suggestion that we should delete the word "forthwith" and replace it with
	<br><blockquote><p>"as soon as is practicable".</p></blockquote>
I have deliberately tried not to speak at length, and have spoken fairly quickly. I regard this as a genuine serious attempt to improve the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Dean. The difficulty we have found on at least two of the series of amendments is that when presenting our case—and no one could accuse my hon Friend of taking his time—a Minister has been twice chosen to follow the first speaker to prevent us making points. But if that process is adopted the Opposition will never have an opportunity to hear the reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Dean. I have been trying to answer debates throughout the proceedings and will continue to do so. Quite often, when discussing amendments, I have not risen second in order to allow two or three hon.

I listened with care to what was said by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis). Although he went into some detail he did not raise any new points on the amendments. However, in future debates my right hon. Friend and I will try to ensure that we respond to points raised by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
