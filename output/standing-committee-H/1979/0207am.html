<div class='page-header'><h1>TRANSPORT BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I make the usual statement that amendments which are currently starred will be notionally unstarred in this afternoon's sitting. Accordingly, we will prepare another selection list for this afternoon's sitting in place of the provisional list now before the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Is there any way in which we could convey our thanks to the staffs of the printers and Public Bill Office for the most exceptional task that they have carried out overnight in the very special circumstances that arose from Tuesday's sitting. They faced considerable additional duties with a long list of amendments which would normally be submitted to them on an entirely different time scale. They served us exceedingly well and enabled us to have an assembled list which unfortunately throws on you, Mr. English, an additional duty this afternoon. But the whole of the Committee will wish those involved to know of our appreciation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's words will be recorded in <i>Hansard</i> and I shall see that they are conveyed to the appropriate quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I seek your guidance on a number of matters. Can you tell me, as somebody who is not yet excessively experienced in Committee work, whether this afternoon is likely to be a long sitting?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot tell the hon. Member that. It is entirely in the hands of the Committee. We all have our beliefs and our forecasts, but that is not a point of order for the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, Mr. English, may I put to you that it would be for the convenience of the staff and the Committee if the Minister could give us some indi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1142</span>
cation of his intentions in that respect. You will recall, Mr. English, that by arrangement last Thursday evening we rose at five o'clock. There was exceptional cooperation and enormous progress was made on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but we are not making progress now. The hon. Gentleman is an ex-Cabinet Minister and he is well aware that such matters are normally conducted through the usual channels and not across the Floor of the Committee.</span></p>

Clause 22</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
REVOCATION, SUSPENSION, ETC. OF LICENCES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 180, in page 20, line 41, leave out subsections (1) and (2) and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1) The traffic commissioners by whom a licence was granted shall revoke the licence if it appears to them at any time that the holder no longer satisfies the requirements specified in section (20)(1), provided that, in the case of a standard licence, where failure to satisfy the requirement as to professional competence arises out of the fact that the transport manager of the business in question has ceased to work for it or is no longer of good repute, the traffic commissioners may, subject to article 3.1 of Council Directive (EEC) 74/562, suspend the revocation of the licence for such period as seems to them reasonably required for enabling a new transport manager to be appointed.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments: No. 179, in page 20, line 41, leave out "standard".<br><br>
No. 188 in page 21, line 7, after "period", insert "not in excess of six months".<br><br>
No. 181, in page 21, line 35, leave out paragraph (<i>d</i>).<br><br>
No. 182, in page 22, line 4, leave out "subsections (1) and (4)(<i>d</i>)" and insert "subsection (1)".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The principal amendment is concerned with the revocation and suspension of licences. This is an extremely important clause, and it will be necessary to give a great deal more attention to it than we were able to give to clause 21.<br><br>
The amendments concern the restrictions and sanctions that will be placed on an operator's licence. The sanctions in clause 22, to which the amendment is addressed, are very powerful, in that they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0625">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1143</span>
will put an operator out of business under certain conditions laid down in the clause.<br><br>
The essence of the amendment and its implications, since it deals with not only our legislation but Community Directive 74/562, is that they are largely concerned with how one maintains quality control in the industry. Previously we were concerned to do that by a road licensing system. Now we are, quite radically, changing over to an operator's licensing system.<br><br>
While that is done in the name of freedom—and most of us have made our points about that philosophy—what we are concerned with in clause 22 is the conditions that will control freedom—a sort of organised freedom—to maintain the public safety that is necessary. That is certainly relevant in clause 22(1) and (2), to which the amendment addresses itself.<br><br>
It can be seen that most of the contents of subsections (1) and (2) have been rolled together into our amendment in a new subsection (1). The amendment makes clear that we are concerned that the traffic commissioners who give the licence shall have the power to revoke it if it appears to them at any time that the holder no longer satisfies the requirements laid down in Clause 20(1). This is the first indication of the difference of standards that are being imposed. It is clear in clause 20(1) that we are dealing with the qualities of the applicant for the licence. He is required to be of good repute, of appropriate financial standing and of professional competence.<br><br>
Admittedly those qualifications are largely concerned with the standard licence. There are further limitations on those qualifications applying to restricted licences. Our first point of disagreement concerns the distinction between the qualifications applying to the two sorts of licence. The amendment concerns the Community directive. Specific reference is made in this case. The Minister has referred us to that directive on various aspects of the Bill, and it is certainly relevant to clause 22. I shall therefore attempt to highlight the differences as they are presented.<br><br>
We are concerned at the possibility of an operator continuing in business when he does not fulfil the necessary requirements, particularly with regard to professional competence. The Bill states that a person may have an operator's licence
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1144</span>
if he fulfils the qualifications, or he may employ, another person who fulfils the qualifications on professional competence to act on his behalf. The requirement of the standard licence in this respect is not merely that the financial conditions, which are relevant to two of the licences, should be observed. The holder must also be of good repute, as determined by the circumstances laid down in the Bill, and the standards of professional competence must also be observed—in this case, limited particularly to the standard operator.<br><br>
Professional competence is an important matter, as indeed are the other two qualifications. Again, these are spelt out not only in the schedules to the Bill—for example, in schedule 3, with which we dealt somewhat briefly last time due to the lateness of the hour and the speed with which we were rushing through the business—but in the EEC document. It is therefore interesting to see what differences exist between our legislation and the requirements of the EEC directive.<br><br>
The essential principles embodied in the Bill in this respect are indeed to be observed, but the latitude allowed seems to be greater under the Bill than under the regulation. If that is not the case, perhaps the Minister will say so.<br><br>
The EEC directive referred to in the amendment was passed on 12 November 1974 and refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the occupation of road passenger transport operators in national and/or international transport operations".</p></blockquote>
That is clearly in line with the provisions of the Bill. Our amendment deals with the matter of a suspension
<br><blockquote><p>"where failure to satisfy the requirement as to professional competence arises out of the fact that the transport manager of the business in question has ceased to work for it or is no longer of good repute".</p></blockquote>
The question of "good repute" will be determined, as laid down in the Bill, at the discretion of the commissioner. For example, the commission of criminal offences or safety offences may affect the attitude of the commissioner in deciding on whether someone is of "good repute". Schedule 3 makes clear what is meant by " good repute". It has the same meaning in the amendment. It is concerned with the previous conduct of the person concerned in the business or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0626">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1145</span>
in the operations of the vehicle, relevant convictions being those which may have occurred during the preceding five years.<br><br>
"Good repute" is therefore defined, albeit perhaps in a lax way, so there is some indication to the commissioners as to what should be taken into account in considering the operation of a particular licence, whether any offence has occurred to which the sanctions in the clause will apply being given some reasonable indication in schedule 3.<br><br>
I turn to the equally important matter of professional competence. Our amendment says that where
<br><blockquote><p>"the transport manager of the business in question has ceased to work for it or is no longer of good repute, the traffic commissioners may, subject to article 3.1 of Council Directive (EEC) 74/562, suspend the revocation of the licence for such period as seems to them reasonably required for enabling a new transport manager to be appointed."</p></blockquote>
10.45 am<br><br>
The Council directive referred to is concerned with the same point. A bus service may be being operated by an individual who may not himself have the necessary qualifications. The Council directive recommends to member States that operators should have to have all those qualifications. The only requirement is that the licence holder at least employs someone with the qualification of professional competence. The criteria of appropriate financial standing and good repute, I understand, apply to the licence holder.<br><br>
The Opposition are concerned about companies that do not have a professional competence laid down both in the Bill and in the Community directive. The definition of professional competence relating to the clause, and to the previous clause, can be found in schedule 3. To a large extent that definition reflects that contained in EEC Directive 74/562 which specifies all the qualifications that it is felt should be held by a person professionally competent to run a passenger transport bus service. I do not intend to delay the Committee by going through the various categories laid down in the EEC directive. However, it is important for the Committee to bear in mind when considering the amendment what should happen if the conditions laid down in schedule 3 for the guidance of traffic commissioners are in their judgment breached. What happens
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1146</span>
when a traffic commissioner feels that an operator no longer fulfils the criterion of professional competence? The amendment provides—as do subsections (1) and (2)—that in that event there shall be a suspension of the requirement for professional competence. We understand the problems of" an operator whose business depends on the qualifications of a manager who through illness, death or some other reason ceases to be in his employment. The licence holder should not automatically be put out of business because of an unforeseen event.<br><br>
Of course, it could be that he has committed serious traffic offences and all manner of other things reflecting on his professional competence. Nevertheless an operator should not suddenly be put out of business simply because one day the qualification of professional competence, as embodied not in the company but in an individual, ceases to be held. The ability of a company to remain in business under the conditions of the operator's licence is here vested not in the company but in an individual. There is the possibility that that individual may by his action remove from a company its qualification to operate under the licence.<br><br>
Every member of the Committee must be able to think of many examples of cases in which that may happen, some more serious than others. The death of a competent professional manager, for example, would be most unfortunate. It may be a very good operating company, or it may be a company operating much nearer the line in which the qualifications may not be so readily evident.<br><br>
There is a possibility, during the suspension, that a company will operate without that essential quality of professional management that determines the quality of the service and the vehicles, and the observance of the company's obligations, not only under the legislation, but to the passengers travelling on its buses. The manager is the key man in the operation. He ensures that the brakes are maintained, the timetable observed, and so on.<br><br>
The clause provides that the traffic commissioners shall decide how long the condition should continue. It is what they may consider reasonable. I shall not try to define "reasonable". We seem to spend a great deal of time on each piece of legislation assessing the meaning of "reasonable". I shall not tempt the Chair by discussing what may be considered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0627">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1147</span>
reasonable. I do not know whether I am competent to define "reasonable".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is always reasonable.</span></p>
<p>The Parliamentary Secretary to The Ministry of Transport <span class='member'>(Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The original definition of "reasonable" concerned the man on the Clapham omnibus. I do not think that I have ever considered the definition of "reasonable" in a more appropriate situation than this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Clapham omnibus is likely to have many lawyers on it, that may be a good definition. I am sure that if we debated the definition on the Clapham omnibus, there would be many interpretations of it, as we may find in the Committee.<br><br>
But it is an important judgment. The commissioners will decide that some companies may operate without professional competence while others will have to observe the regulations. We understand the necessity to allow flexibility. It arises out of the attempt to impose a regularised or controlled freedom by this method rather than through the present licensing system which has maintained a level of quality of which people would not necessarily disapprove, particularly in regard to vehicles. There are differences about the service, but in regard to professional competence, we are concerned more with the quality of the vehicle than anything else. It involves the safety of the passenger and the competence of the company to carry out its professional obligation. We are imposing that obligation on a professional person.<br><br>
The definition of a "professional manager" is given in an EEC directive. It refers to the qualifications of a professional person issued by certificate. I am on shaky ground about the present position. I recall reading in, I think, the Foster report, about the principle of operating controls through an operator's licence. Two provisions prevail and reflect what is contained in the directive and what the Government have included in the Bill. One is that the competence of a man should reflect certain things, such as an understanding of the law, the services, the technical standards of operation, road safety and so on. The Community con-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1148</span>
siders all those things important for a certificate of competence.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister can tell us the present position regarding the certificate of competence. Apparently an important consideration is experience. EEC regulations—perhaps not this one—already impose the condition of the "grandfather" clause.<br><br>
A constituent of mine was trying to apply in December 1979. He argued the "grandfather" clause. That left me a little bemused when I first heard it, since he was only about 35. However, I soon learned that that term reflects experience. Personal competence must, inevitably, reflect the experience of the person concerned.<br><br>
Until, I think, December of last year the experience of running a number of buses or other vehicles for some years was considered sufficient evidence of professional competence. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that at present the requirement is for a person to show that he has had two years' experience of managing a transport system. Presumably the same conditions now apply to buses as to the lorry industry. Two years' such experience will be considered sufficient to demonstrate competence to manage a bus transport system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend not welcome the fact that practical experience is part and parcel of the competence argument? Would he not agree with me that though one may have all the paper qualifications in the world, a period of experience is to be welcomed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That is a very important point. I shall speak later about the other qualifications. Practical experience has been made, by some of the regulations and the EEC, the sole requirement for professional competence. Does the Minister wish to intervene?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I am being invited to intervene to make the position clear. The present position is as described by the hon. Gentleman concerning heavy goods vehicle and bus transport managers. The Bill re-enacts the present regulations as part of the operator licence system which we are now introducing for passenger transport. Schedule 3, paragraphs (7) and (8), on pages 52 and 53 of the Bill, set out details of the rules by which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0628">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1149</span>
certificate of professional competence will be given to those already engaged in passenger transport. That is what is known as the "grandfather" rights. For the future, paragraph (5) and subsequent paragraphs of schedule 3 lay down the basis on which certificates will be issued for new entrants to the profession.<br><br>
I realise that schedule 3 was taken very late at night. The amendment with which we are now concerned turns on the narrow point of what happens during the interval once the holder of the certificate of professional competence has ceased to work as the transport manager. I am trying to follow the argument to see what is the point of the amendment, as opposed to the description of the schedules and the Bill. As I understand it, we are being pressed to say how long will elapse once the transport manager has ceased to work for an operator before the operator's licence is revoked. That, as far as I can gather, is what is troubling the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, both amendments reflect the difficulty of the person in whom is invested the professional qualification for the company to operate a bus service. Both our amendment and the Government amendments concern what happens when that company, for whatever reason, is deprived of the qualification of that person. There should be a debate about what latitude for exemption there should be to that important qualification. Another important matter attaching to that, with which we are concerned in the amendment, is the period which is to be judged as reasonable in the legislation. The EEC directive is more definitive about what the maximum time should be. It is important for the Committee to make its mind up. I do not think we should rush over this matter too lightly.<br><br>
After all, as one who had the argument about a tacograph being required by an EEC directive shoved down my throat, I find it a little too much to swallow to be told by Ministers that there is a difference between the observation of an EEC directive, what the Government are now doing in the name of an EEC directive and what is actually in that directive. What is "reasonable" about the Clapham omnibus that was mentioned may well be a matter of 12 months, six months, three years or five years.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Perhaps that is why the directive referred
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1150</span>
to in the amendment does not use the word "reasonable", a word that in British legislation usually means that one can get away with something. We never see the word "reasonable" in trade union legislation, or where legislation in certain other areas is being tied down. One only sees the word used when it comes to matters of safety and where discretion has to be allowed.<br><br>
The amendment is concerned with whether we are to allow companies to operate without the essential condition laid down for the licence. Other clauses that we have debated define and limit the action and discretion allowed to commissioners. We do not give a commissioner a total right to withdraw a man's licence— the clause distinguishes very clearly between where a commissioner has only to establish a fact to take sanctions against a company and where, later in the clause, he has an unfettered right to exercise his discretion.<br><br>
Therefore it is relevant to the clause and the amendment to determine what will be the sanctions if the conditions are breached. A good deal of time has been spent—if the subject of time wasting is being raised—in going into detail on whether a professional person should have a limited degree of financial competence and other similar arguments. There is a minefield waiting if you, Mr. English, allow us to wade through it in making such points, but I do not want to do that. I know it may seem odd, but on this side of the Committee we have tried to make progress on a number of occasions both officially and unofficially. It is only now that we seem to be running into difficulties.<br><br>
However, leaving that matter aside, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to schedule 3 when dealing with the issue of competence. We have taken the grandfather clause and left that alone because, as I understand matters, that does not apply after December 1979. I believe that the requirement was that the application has to be made before November, in any case, so to that extent—perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to confirm this—that position will never apply to a bus operator. He can no longer make an application as the date of December 1979 has been passed, thus making the clause redundant and not applicable to the bus industry.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0629">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1151</span>
I may be wrong, but, by definition, under the grandfather clause, two years' experience alone without a diploma will not apply after December 1979. Therefore, why is the clause in the Bill? It now no longer matters to the road haulage industry or to the passenger bus industry, so the Minister should decide whether the clause is relevant to the Bill. All that is now required, as was pointed out in regard to schedule 3(5), dealing with professional competence, is that an individual has the relevant diploma. We shall return to that matter when we come to deal with the schedules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two purposes. First, under schedule 3(9), there might be late applicants who satisfy the grandfather rights criteria and for some reason have not yet bothered to apply, but because they can prove that they satisfy the criteria they are entitled at any stage to come along to collect their certificates and act as transport managers. It is important to have that in the legislation because there will be a large number of operators who are getting their operators' licences relying on the certificate given to someone who exercised grandfather rights. Therefore, it is as well to make it clear what that man's qualifications are and to make sure that that is firmly enshrined in legislation. I do not think that there is disagreement between them as to grandfather rights; that is why they are included.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary is right, but this amendment concerns professional competence and the question whether there is a distinction between the EEC requirement and the Bill, which our amendment mentions and the clause does not. If the Minister is right in saying that the clause will still apply after the Bill is enacted, that is an entirely different provision from that existing in the road haulage industry. I am informed that that could not be claimed for that industry.<br><br>
When I took up a constituent's case I was told that by the traffic commissioner, who said that there could be no applications after November. He had discretion into December which he gave to me to give to my constituent so that he could take the matter up. If my interpretation of "road" is right, there is a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1152</span>
distinctive difference, in that a person with two years' experience in the road haulage industry would not be able to claim that as sufficient if he had not applied before December.<br><br>
When the Parliamentary Secretary replies, perhaps he will comment on that, because it will make an important difference as to whom will be considered professionally competent. I will explain why that is important. If a man operated a bus between 1960 and 1962 and gave that as evidence of two years' experience as a professionally competent manager by 1982, that would hardly fill me with satisfaction over the criteria for professional competence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that not highlight the danger of allowing too much discretion to traffic commissioners, thereby providing for all kinds of interpretations, which the Government probably never intended? My hon. Friend has highlighted a classic case.<br><br>
Suppose a traffic commissioner in another area interprets differently. Surely our job is to put sense into the provisions so that they can be interpreted uniformly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important difficulty with interpretation. It is another level of the argument, into which I do not wish to trail, as to how the commissioners may interpret differently because of their power and discretion in this area.<br><br>
There are broad areas of professional competence which the commissioner should take into account. The Bill is specific: he should have one experience, which is limited by dates. We shall be interested in the Minister's comments as to whether the man who worked in 1960–62 would be a professionally competent manager in 1980.<br><br>
The second qualification for a professional manager is that he must have a diploma. I will not dwell too much on that but perhaps the Minister can interpret the meaning of "diploma". I recall reading Foster on this whole matter of professional competence as regards roads—and this whole clause is lifted from road haulage provisions into bus services. I am pleased to see that the Minister agrees with that, because he inherits the criticisms of Foster that apparently the lorries will come to the buses.<br><br>
The organisation that gives a diploma of professional competence is the Arts

Society. I was staggered to learn that it was that society which—[<i>an hon. Member:</i> "The Royal Society of Arts."] Sorry. As a provincial hick, I do not know these distinctive differences. I meant the Royal Society of Arts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I assist the hon. Gentleman? I know that the Minister referred to schedule 3 but we have debated it, so, strictly speaking, we are straying if we return to discussing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept your point, Mr. English. It is fair and irrefutable in many ways that schedule 3 is not related to acceptance of qualifications for professional competence which we argued on the previous clause related to schedule 3. You may not be aware, Mr. English, because at that time your colleague in the Chair was with us, that the circumstances at the time, after many hours of debate, had their effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gather the Committee finished early.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Early in terms of the House of Commons, but finishing at half-past four or five in the morning after starting at 10.30 the morning before, with all the other business that one is expected to deal with, plus shorter breaks as the time wore on, was long enough. The logic of this House is that the longer one works the less time one has for a break, which, as a trade unionist, I have always found it difficult to understand. It is about time we changed that. Therein might lie the definition of "reasonable". But "reasonable" in this case is determined by the Chairman, so, Mr. English, we look to your charity if we have to embark on a similar voyage.<br><br>
The EEC directive is concerned with what shall be the period for which a suspension of the condition of professional competence shall apply. Subsections 1 and 2 refer to what is reasonable. That opens up many questions about what might be reasonable so perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary can give us some indication of what might be "reasonable" if he finishes the crossword in time. In 10 Across the clue is "reasonable".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Four down is "undoubtedly muddled", which appropriately describes the hon. Gentleman's speech.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1154</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my attention has been drawn to this, I must tell the Minister that newspapers are not normally accepted in Committee or in the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whether the matter is muddled or not is a question for judgment, but it will not be made easier if Ministers continue to do crossword puzzles when arguments are being made about serious issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. Would not the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) be better employed doing a crossword? Then he might have something to think about while he spoke.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a distinctive difference between what is in the EEC directive and what is in the clause. Can the Minister say what is in the directive? Has he read it? Does he even have a copy of it? No. He just sits there pontificating and making remarks about a matter he does not understand. He has not told us whether he has read the directive or knows of the distinctive difference between what his clause says and what the EEC directive says.<br><br>
We are dealing here with EEC legislation. On other issues concerning the EEC, the hon. Gentleman has a great deal to say about its standards being imposed upon this House. Now that we are debating a clause which might be affected by what the EEC is imposing upon us, whether we are willing or unwilling to accept it, he makes that kind of remark. I shall regard the remainder of his remarks with the same contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows full well the answers to all the points he has so far made, and he is deliberately wasting the time of the Committee. He knows that these directions were made effective by his Government as they applied to road haulage and road transport and that there is no option but to apply them in this form to passenger transport. Everything he has said this morning is a continuing effort to waste the time of the House and the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member has shown the greatest ignorance of what is in the directive. The directive states clearly that each member shall make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0631">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1155</span>
a decision. It gives what it considers to be the distinction or objective to aim for, but the power remains with the member State to impose its own interpretation. The hon. Gentleman's intervention only proves once again that there is a great deal of comment about EEC matters but no attention to any detail relevant either to the clause or to its general application.<br><br>
11.15am<br><br>
EEC directive 74/562 was specifically included in the amendment. I shall quote from it because the subsections make clear that it is a question of what is reasonable. The Community gives us some indication of what may be considered the area for suspension. Article 3.1 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member States shall determine the circumstances in which operation of a road passenger transport undertaking may, by way of derogation from the provisions of Article 2(1), be continued on a temporary basis for a maximum period of one year, with extension for a maximum period of six months, in duly justified special cases, in the event of the death or physical or legal incapacity of the natural person"—</p></blockquote>
[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) should listen to what I am reading to the Committee. He has accused me of wasting time but he should listen to hear whether this clause is relevant to the directive instead of talking during the debate and making comments without having read the document. I am doing him the courtesy of showing him where it is relevant to the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the first time in three-quarters of an hour that the hon. Member has made a relevant comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is a matter of judgment from the Minister on whether I am relevant now, it would at least give an answer to the points being made by his hon. Friend.<br><br>
I was quoting from article 3.1, part of which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"a temporary basis for a maximum period of one year with an extension for a maximum period of six months, in duly justified special cases".</p></blockquote>
The directive goes on to define what may be considered a "duly justified" case. The Bill does not define a "duly justified" case. The directive continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"in the event of death"—</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1156</span>
a reasonable requirement; one can understand the position of a company in that circumstance—
<br><blockquote><p>"or physical or legal incapacity"—</p></blockquote>
I do not know what that means; perhaps the person concerned is in gaol—
<br><blockquote><p>"of the natural person engaged in the occupation of transport operator or of the natural person who satisfies the provisions of Article 2(1)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>c</i>)."</p></blockquote>
Article 2(1) (<i>a</i>) and (<i>c</i>) refers to good repute and professional competence.<br><br>
In the Government's notes the point is made that the clause is important for maintaining quality controls and safety. That is the area of control now being legislated for in this clause. That being so, why is the standard less than the standard the Community is asking us to impose? Why should not a limit be placed on how long a company can operate without a certificate of professional competence? Is the word "reasonable" to mean more than 12 months, or the possibility of 18 months? The Community will allow an extension of six months on top of the original 12 months. Therefore, the Community regulations envisage that there shall be 18 months during which a company could operate without the essential qualification of professional competence.<br><br>
I am not happy that any company should operate for a year without a manager with professional competence, during a period when the Community will require that all those buses have certificates of fitness. That is a new change that we are making, one that the Government claim is an advance in safety. That is, unlike present legislation, each vehicle now will be required to have such certificates of fitness, which I believe are to be on a yearly basis.<br><br>
That being so, how could a period greater than 12 months possibly be considered? Every vehicle in a fleet will have been expected to be prepared and put forward for examination, and to go through those sensitive areas where an operator's competent judgment is vital. I assume that in this case "reasonable" means that it must be more than 12 months or 18 months.<br><br>
Otherwise, why do the Government not accept the directive which says 12 months and 18 months? All we are asking the Minister to do is give us good reason why, if the directive is being observed in other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0632">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1157</span>
contexts, he does not limit the period to which professional competence will not apply. "reasonable" is a word that is far too elastic for many of us. Indeed, the Community's requirement that it will be a maximum of one year and a further six months—18 months in all—is far too long.<br><br>
At least the Community says "member States shall determine". All we have proposed is the maximum, not the minimum. Surely the Minister could indicate what he means by "reasonable", and perhaps consider before Report whether to impose a time limit. We may wish to put in a time limit at a later stage of the Bill. It seems relevant for a time limit to be imposed when a company will be robbed or denied the competence of that professional to deal with that important matter of safety.<br><br>
I have directed my point to the difference between the Bill's contents and the amendment concerning the Community directive. I have not addressed my remarks to other amendments, some of them consequential on what happens.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. We are debating Amendments Nos. 180, 181, 182, 179 and 188. Having sought the advice of the Public Bill Office, I understand the technical reasons for the coupling. I appreciate that, if amendment No. 180 is carried, amendments Nos. 181 and 182 can be regarded as completely consequential. The same argument, however, does not apply to amendments Nos. 179 and 188, as—irrespective of whether amendment No. 180 is carried or defeated —the points raised by the two amendments are relevant. They are separate points and we have not yet commenced to debate them.<br><br>
I seek your advice on two points, Mr. English. First, irrespective of what happens to amendment No. 180, will we be able to have Divisions on amendments Nos. 179 and 188? Secondly, would you advise us whether we should proceed as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) did—on the clear assumption that we can debate amendments No. 180, 181 and 182, to which all his remarks were addressed, as a separate issue? Or should we, if we have views on this matter of great judgment and balance that is involved, comment on the other two amendments at the same time?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the right
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1158</span>
hon. Gentleman made a valid point and then put it too wide, so to speak. Certainly, the answer to his first question is "No". There cannot be separate Divisions on, say, amendment No. 179 irrespective of what happens to amendment No. 180, because, as the right hon. Member observed, amendment No. 179 would automatically have fallen if amendment No. 180 were carried.<br><br>
However, if one is working on the assumption that amendment No. 180 might not be carried, if hon. Members wished I would then be prepared to consider a separate Division on amendment No. 179.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. English. If amendment No. 180 is carried, we are still dealing with a clause which refers to the case of the standard licence. Therefore, if we wish to pursue the question whether it should be restricted to a standard licence, amendment No. 179 still has relevance. I appreciate the technical point that there is a line reference, but the main point would still be relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it is quite simple. Let us just see what happens. It would certainly not be possible to have a separate Division on an amendment to something that had disappeared. If it is an amendment to something that is still there, I am willing to consider a separate Division. Shall we see what happens?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. English, the standard licence reference will still be there, whether or not amendment No. 180 is carried. The point of the second amendment therefore remains relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon, Gentleman is making heavy weather of this. The word that amendment No. 179 seeks to leave out will indeed be present. All this is totally hypothetical, but if amendment No. 180 were carried the Committee would just have agreed to take it out. I seriously suggest to the Committee that we should see what happens to amendment No. 180. The Chair is willing to be reasonable about Divisions if they are relevant, but one cannot have irrelevant Divisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will attempt to confine myself exclusively to amendment No. 188 in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0633">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1159</span>
Central (Mr. Cowans) and myself. That amendment would limit the period during which a traffic commissioner may suspend the revocation of a licence, in the event of a transport manager ceasing to work for the undertaking or being no longer of good repute, to six months, during which the undertaking may go about the process of getting a new transport manager. I shall make no reference to EEC regulations, as I do not particularly approve of that body and I do not have the experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) in his visits to the European Assembly in its old form. I therefore do not have the necessary expertise.<br><br>
Before dealing directly with amendment No. 188, I will make two or three points about the general question of transport managers. First, I should not like anything that is said by the Opposition to suggest that any of us attaches too much importance to the role of the manager of any organisation in relation to the success of that organisation. Clearly, any organisation depends upon the competence and professional skills of all the people working in it. They are not entirely dependent upon the skills of managers.<br><br>
In a sense, therefore, the emphasis placed by the clause on the professional competence of the transport manager might be interpreted as attaching rather too much importance to that gentleman— or gentlewoman, for that matter. The clause nevertheless attaches immense importance to the professional competence and professional standing of the manager who either owns and operates his own business or is employed by someone else to operate a public passenger transport business. That being so, we must attach as much importance to this, as the clause does.<br><br>
The reason why so much importance is attached to the professional competence of the manager of a public passenger transport business is that somebody has to take responsibility in law for what goes on. The transport manager is the man who under clauses 16(3), 17(10) and 18(6) will be expected to exercise "due diligence" to ensure that those important provisions of the Bill are observed.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
We cannot therefore attach too much mportance to securing a proper level
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1160</span>
of professional competence in the manager of a public passenger transport business. Having said that, I must admit that I am rather doubtful about the whole concept of professional competence. I believe that it was George Bernard Shaw who said that all professions were a conspiracy against the laity. I accept that view. I am even more leery of a clause which in relation to the schedule refers us not only to professional judgment but to reasonableness. Bearing in mind the Parliamentary Secretary's crossword, I would define "reasonable" as a 10-letter word meaning a concept wholly alien to the legal profession, among others.<br><br>
We must consider with great care what is professional competence and what is regarded as such. We should also examine with care the concept of reasonableness.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slowly forming a judgment as to the hon. Member's professional competence at this stage. I think that we might revert to discussing the professional competence of transport managers rather than that of lawyers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have to accept your ruling, Mr. English. Those are the rules of procedure in the House and in Committee. However, I should like to point out that the provisions of the Bill will be interpreted by people actively engaged in the business. If those people appear to misinterpret them, the judgment and activities of lawyers will come to the fore. Throughout the proceedings on the Bill, the Opposition have stated their desire to ensure that it can be understood by the people operating in the business, whether they are passenger transport managers, traffic commissioners, policemen, or members of bodies representing the public or of trade unions representing workers in public passenger transport undertakings. We are determined to ensure that lawyers do not become involved.<br><br>
Every time lawyers are involved it seems that, by and large, they make a fortune and no one else does very well. To that extent we are dealing with matters that relate to the professional competence of lawyers. The Committee has an obligation to ensure that the law is such that people operating it can interpret it.<br><br>
I am not sure how one is supposed to determine the professional competence of politicians. But looking upon them as professional legislators one finds precious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0634">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1161</span>
little evidence that there has been a high degree of professionalism in this House over the last 20 or 30 years. The standard of laws produced has, frankly, been pathetic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the hon. Gentleman—a new Member of this House —will over the next 30 years legislate better than in his opinion his predecessors have done. But I doubt if he will do it if he does not refer to the subject before him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must admit, Mr. English, that I was unfortunately diverted.<br><br>
I return to amendment No. 188 which seeks to limit the period in which a public passenger transport undertaking can do without the transport manager to whom the Bill attaches such great importance.<br><br>
It seems that if a public passenger transport undertaking is to be so dependent —legally and, in many spheres, in practice —on the competence of a professional manager, it follows that it should have a professional manager in post, if not all the time, at the minimum possible intervals. My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and I carefully considered what might be a reasonable period—to define for ourselves what was meant by "reasonable"— during which a passenger transport undertaking could at the discretion of the traffic commissioners do without that important professional manager. We concluded that six months would be reasonable. We considered the length of time an organisation might face when seeking to recruit another manager and that there are substantial numbers of people in that category who are on three months' or six months' notice, although we felt that three months' notice would probably be a long period in practice and that there might be people with the necessary competence on notice of only one month.<br><br>
Nevertheless, it was obvious to us that some reasonable time must be given for the recruitment of that important professional manager but that there needed to be a limit to the discretion of the traffic commissioners.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I warn my hon. Friend at this stage that I am against him on this amendment? Does not my hon. Friend think that a period of six months is quite inflexible? My hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1162</span>
Friend knows the state of the labour market. Does not he think that it is stretching matters rather far to impose a time limit?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was one of the matters that my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central and I considered at length. We took into account the present, and the likely future circumstances of the labour market. After considering the onset of higher levels of unemployment and the possibility that the provisions of the Bill may close down a considerable number of passenger transport undertakings, or cause those larger undertakings that have served the country so well for so long to shed professional managers, we concluded that the six months' limit was probably right.<br><br>
We accept that in practical terms that may be a little on the short side. I do not know, Mr. English, whether I may refer to Nottingham while you are in the Chair or should refer instead to the City of Newcastle. It seems that the Newcastle bus outfit could reasonably expect in a period of six months from the day that its professional manager is gaoled, dies or goes elsewhere to recruit a man they expect to be of equal standing. That undertaking might get into difficulties if it went through the procedure of advertising a post, halfway recruiting a person who later turned down the job and had to restart the process. But even in those circumstances it appeared that the period should not exceed six months, and my hon. Friend and I were concerned that the matter should not be left open-ended. Therefore, we are not dead-set on the idea that a six month's limit is the only conceivable one and accept that that may be on the short side. But some sort of limit on the discretion of the traffic commissioners is required in this case. Otherwise, the lax traffic commissioners and all sorts of regulatory organisations could say "Let's be reasonable. We appreciate your problems. No one wants to live in John o'Groat's"—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Marshall</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not true.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise—" We know you would have difficulty in recruiting", and soon.<br><br>
If the transport manager is so important—the Bill places great emphasis on his role—organisations should not be operating
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0635">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1163</span>
without him for longer than absolutely necessary. After consideration, we decided that a six-month period was right. If the Parliamentary Secretary, having considered factors that may not have occurred to us, comes up with a longer period—say eight or nine months—we should be prepared to accept that. But we would not be prepared to accept, without a Division, leaving the provision without any time limit at all on the discretion of the traffic commissioners. That is vital.<br><br>
In managerial and personnel terms, the manager is the linchpin of the controls that will be exercised by the traffic commissioners on the safety provisions of the Bill. He will be responsible for ensuring the safe running and maintenance of the fleet of buses under his control, and seeing that the other aspects of the various licences are complied with. It seems absurd to pin on him all this responsibility, to have schedules and EEC regulations regarding his qualifications, the way in which he is to be recruited and whether he needs paper qualifications or only to be a man of such vast experience that he qualifies under the grandfather clause, and yet allow a passenger transport undertaking to do without his services for longer than is necessary.<br><br>
In the light of those factors, a six-month period would be right. If the Minister wants to impose a longer period, well and good. He might accept the six-month period with the possibility of a waiver in certain extraordinary circumstances. If not, at the appropriate time, we shall divide the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are concerned with the requirements that stem originally from EEC directives. As the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) has pointed out, it is the Council directive of 12 November 1974, L308/23. It has been accepted by this country and by the Council of Ministers as binding upon us. Therefore, it must be re-enacted in our law. It was the previous Labour Government who, in 1977, complied with the directive and introduced the regulations which, among other things, require certificates of professional competence for lorry drivers and transport managers.<br><br>
My views tend to be extremely pro-EEC. It is an issue on which I disagree
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1164</span>
with hon. Gentlemen, including my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate).<br><br>
There have been occasions on which I have had doubts about the certificate of professional competence and the examinations of the Royal Society of Arts. But it was accepted by the previous Government and is now becoming part of our law. One must consult the directive to find what we have followed in the regulations and is now being re-enacted in the Bill.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
I had much advice in finding my way around the maze which the directive, needless to say, comprises. Perhaps I may most easily answer the basic point troubling Opposition Members by relating it to the terms of the Bill.<br><br>
One of the most important aspects of amendment No. 180 is the question raised by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), whether the Bill as it stands complies with the directive. The hon. Gentleman implied that he thought, first, that it did not. Secondly, he would prefer it if it did, because he would prefer definite time limits rather than the very English concept of reasonableness. One advantage of his lengthy speech was that it gave me time to discover the relevant parts of the directive. I think I have now discovered them.<br><br>
Article 3.1 of the directive was read out by the hon. Member. That refers to a restricted number of duly justified special cases—for instance the death or physical or legal incapacity of the transport manager. That, presumably, is why it gives a startlingly long period of 12 months to replace the transport manager, with extension for a maximum of six months. Eighteen months seems a very long time to allow for replacing a competent transport manager, if he is a vital part of the operation. My personal judgment, having thought about the matter for the last hour and a half, is that it was intended that if someone were ill, for instance, there may be a good case for saying that his job should not be filled while he was away from work, unable to carry out his duties. It would be proper to keep the job open for him. However, there must be a maximum period for that; hence the allowance of 12, or even 18, months.<br><br>
The Bill deals with every situation in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0636">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1165</span>
which the transport manager has ceased to work. We have not bothered to pick out a special case. We are dealing merely with the situation where the operator's licence has been obtained because there is a transport manager with the necessary certificate of competence, who has been fired or has taken another job, or has simply ceased to work for the business. Plainly, it is nonsense that the entire operation should close if the transport manager walks out in a huff. The entire bus business should not be shut down until it is possible to employ another transport manager with a certificate.<br><br>
The relevant part of the EEC directive which covers the generality of cases appears to be article 5.2:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member states shall ensure that the competent authorities withdraw the authorization to pursue the occupation of passenger transport operator if they establish that the provisions of Article 2(1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) are no longer satisfied.".</p></blockquote>
Those are the professional competence provisions.
<br><blockquote><p>"In this case, however, they shall allow sufficient time for a substitute to be appointed.".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the difference between our wording and the EEC directive with which we seek to comply in accordance with the long-established policy, both of the previous Government and of the present Government, is that we have said that the traffic commissioners should
<br><blockquote><p>"suspend the revocation of the licence for such period as seems to them reasonably required",</p></blockquote>
whereas the EEC wording is that they shall allow "sufficient time". That is not a wide difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's wider point. But will he accept that while article 5.2 is relevant to the wider consideration, it does not impinge directly upon the amendment? The amendment would not require the commissioners to have regard to article 5.2, but only to article 3.1. Article 5.2 does not, therefore, seem to be relevant to the amendment, although it is relevant to the wider argument about how EEC directives work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to four down
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1166</span>
in my crossword is "muddle-headed", and one of the problems that arose while I was solving that was understanding the point of amendment No. 180. Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that the amendment is confined to the extremely narrow point that the Bill fails to specify the 18 months' period in the case of
<br><blockquote><p>"'death or physical or legal incapacity"</p></blockquote>
of the transport manager while he is in his job?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the reference to article 3.1 is muddle headed, it is also muddle headed in the regulation. The Minister has made it clear that he is not in doubt about the meaning of article 3.1. His argument appears to be that it is much narrower than making it applicable to all who are professionally competent, which he rightly connects to article 5.2. Our amendment was specifically directed to article 3.1. In that area it is much tighter than article 3.1.<br><br>
I do not know whether the Minister was doing his crossword at the time, but I told him that the argument about the time period would come out during the debate. On Report, we should probably give consideration, after listening to the Minister, to a general time limit. The record will show that I said that. There cannot be any doubt about line 4. If the Minister had paid more attention to the argument than to the crossword puzzle, he might not have been asking that question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to answer this question?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot have an intervention on an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now moving to the point of the amendment. It does not give a tighter definition of article 3.1. It seems to be an extremely wide definition, allowing 18 months for the transport manager not to be carrying out his duties—a maximum limit in special cases. At present subsection (2) allows the commissioners to apply the test of reasonableness in the case of death—I am not sure how the difficulty arises in the case of death—physical or legal incapacity—which means that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0637">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1167</span>
man is seriously ill or has gone temporarily round the bend. In such circumstances, the traffic commissioners would have regard to what was reasonable, given the physical condition of the transport manager who was not at his post.<br><br>
I now see the point of amendment No. 180, which concerns whether it is necessary to import into our legislation an 18 months' maximum period beyond which the traffic commissioners shall not regard it as reasonable to wait for the recovery of the unfortunate transport manager.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tell the hon. Member for Faversham(Mr. Moate).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With reference to my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), when we narrow it down we have been discussing whether, in the case of an incapable transport manager, an 18 months' maximum should be allowed before another is appointed, and that point has been reached after 42 minutes. Therefore, my hon. Friend's intervention was wholly justified. The extremely important point that the hon. Gentleman wished to stress is best answered by saying that I believe that the reasonableness that we are allowing traffic commissioners to exercise will adequately cover that difficult point. I therefore do not think that an 18 month cut-off is essential.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) preferred a six months' maximum to the general "reasonable" test contained in the Bill. I do not think that there is a great deal between us in principle. We are acting on the basis that the transport manager who holds a certificate of professional competence should be a key man in the business from the public's point of view. We therefore need to be satisfied that someone is in charge who knows the traffic laws and the obligations upon him, who knows the business and can run his buses properly. That being so, six months is a fairly generous period to allow for a gap to occur while a new transport manager is appointed. Indeed I, should have thought that, in most circumstances, most traffic commissioners would be hard pressed to find it reasonable to allow as long as six months between a transport operator ceasing to work for an undertaking and the business finding a suitable successor
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1168</span>
who holds a certificate of professional competence.<br><br>
I therefore believe that the wording of the Bill would probably achieve exactly the same effect as the hon. Gentleman's amendment. If six months have gone by, the traffic commissioners are likely to be getting very agitated indeed and demanding a very good explanation as to why nobody has been appointed to take over that key role. The difficulty in providing for a fixed limit rather than a reasonable time is, as the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) pointed out in an intervention, that a set time is inflexible. One would therefore take away any discretion from the traffic commissioners. A business may spend a long time looking for a suitable chap, thinking that it has six months in which to do so. It may hire a person who will be available to come and work for it five months later. Then, at the last minute, the undertaking may find that it has been let down because he has taken a job in East Africa and is not coming.<br><br>
Under the amendment, the operator's licence would automatically have to be revoked. The traffic commissioners could not decide that it would be reasonable to allow a little longer. If six months have gone by, they will be under a duty to revoke the licence and the business will be closed down. The traffic commissioners would not have the power to suspend revocation of the licence. They might thus find themselves closing down Nottingham city transport, to cite the example already given which I know is close to your own heart, Mr. English, and indeed to mine. That would be a rather drastic conclusion.<br><br>
I apologise if I strayed out of order by glancing at a crossword puzzle, Mr. English, but I have listened to the argument. The conclusion seems to be that, if we put in a set time limit, circumstances of that kind may arise. The position would be totally inflexible, and the penalty imposed is so severe that I should prefer to leave the commissioners some discretion. The wording of the Bill is that of the English lawyer, namely that of reasonableness—the judgment of the man on the Clapham omnibus. In this case, it will be the judgment of the traffic commissioners. Traffic commissioners are responsible people. They know the importance of the transport manager, they know the business better than we do, and they will be able to exercise perfectly sensible judgments as to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0638">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1169</span>
what is a reasonable time to allow in which a well-run bus business can be expected to find a replacement transport manager of the right quality.<br><br>
Therefore, I prefer the flexibility of our own proposals to the amendments being put forward. The hon. Member for Ipswich is quite right. It is best to leave this flexible and to avoid setting a fixed time limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could assist the Committee with a little procedural advice. There has been talk of having a separate Division on a later amendment. I think that the way to deal with that procedurally, if it is desired, would be for the mover of amendment No. 180 at an appropriate stage to seek leave to withdraw the amendment. If it is not withdrawn or if, for example, a closure is moved and carried, we should be in some difficulty about having a separate Division on the subsequent amendment. Therefore, if hon. Members wish the Division to be on the subsequent amendment, they must take action accordingly.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. English, for appreciating that two major points are involved in amendments Nos. 180, 181 and 182, whereas the Parliamentary Secretary is seized of only one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that there is another point, but one and a half hours have gone by and no hon. Member opposite has mentioned it. This is obvious filibustering. The right hon. Gentleman deliberately excluded the other point in the amendment and intended to rise, after I had spoken, to argue the second point at most inordinate length. If we are now to begin to argue that no discretion should be allowed for restrictive licences and that this shall apply absolutely to restricted and standard licences, we are following a derogation, as the last Government did, allowed by article 3.1 of the directive. It is absurd to propose that we should not use the maximum flexibility allowed under the directive. It would be wrong to take away one of the most valuable features of restricted licences. It was all dealt with on Tuesday by my hon. Friend. That is my answer and I shall not answer again if the hon. Gentleman now gets up and begins labouring this point at the same tedious length as his hon. Friends laboured the other very narrow point.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1170</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an uncharacteristically insulting and cavalier contribution from the Parliamentary Secretary. If he is suggesting through you, Mr. English, that we should not debate the issue whether there should be equality of treatment for holders of standard and restricted licences, I suggest that he needs to think again about his whole attitude to the work of a Standing Committee of this House. This is a matter of great importance and concern to those who operate within the industry. The Minister must realise that he is trying to push through the House a Bill which has no support whatever from any major transport organisation. He cannot find a major employers' organisation to support his judgment, or a major union or local authority to support him. Therefore, he has to realise that we will raise in Committee matters which are of legitimate and serious concern to operators who will be affected by them.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary is intelligent enough to have anticipated that this point was to be raised and he could, had he so chosen, have dealt with it earlier. He is right in judging that I will raise it. I must do so, because it is one of two major points for debate.<br><br>
The other major point is difficult. I do not think for a moment that we on this side have a monopoly of wisdom with which to judge the first point—far from it. This is difficult and the European Parliament realised it. That is why, when the Commission considered it, it decided that it should be left to member States to determine the circumstances by way of derogation. Unlike their decisions on other things, there was recognition that this was difficult and sensitive and had to be judged within the circumstances of each State as to how it could be successfully applied.<br><br>
In a sense, it is perfectly fair for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that the point is narrow. It certainly is narrow when considered in terms of how many words are needed in a Bill to say whether the traffic commissioners should have absolutely free and unfettered discretion, or whether, when they come to consider the question of suspending or revoking the licence, they should have regard to article 3.1 of the Council directive.<br><br>
The ramifications are absolutely enormous, there is no denying that. On that decision will turn whether a business can operate; whether a man running a com-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0639">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1171</span>
pany will go bankrupt; whether his employees will be thrown out of work.<br><br>
Our dilemma in the Committee goes wider than that. Having, on the Minister's advice, accepted that the certificate of professional competence is essential to ensure that businesses are properly run in this country, we now have to consider a clause that the commissioner shall have absolute discretion to set aside the requirement. The dilemma is as wide and as difficult as that. We are trying to judge how far it is right to offset all the advantages of having businesses run by professionally competent people, certified in a particular way, against the disadvantages of a business having to be closed down in certain circumstances such as if the competent manager ceased to be employed by the firm, fell ill or lost his certificate of competence because of an illegal action, for instance. I accept that the Minister had to make a judgment in drafting the Bill. But the judgment made in the Bill is that in all those circumstances, the traffic commissioners should have complete discretion.<br><br>
The judgment we made by those in framing the amendment was that the commissioner should not have unfettered discretion. Our judgment is the same as that made by the majority of operators in the industry. I have consulted the Confederation of British Road Passenger Transport Ltd. on the issue. They have also considered it long and carefully. They came to the same view as we have come to on this side of the Committee. It should not be an unfettered judgment. It should be exercised only within the terms of article 3.1. In other words, when the commissioner exercises his judgment on whether to suspend or to revoke.<br><br>
We were careful not to include Article 5.2 also. I accept the relevance of what the Minister says about article 5.2, but it provides that when authorisation to pursue the occupation of transport operator is withdrawn, due to failure to comply with any criteria of the directive, the authorities "shall allow sufficient time for the new manager to be appointed". It is interesting that our judgment is also that of the industry. Individual member States throughout the EEC are trying, in their own transport legislation, to take a serious and responsible decision on the issue.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Weetch</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to stop my right hon. Friend at this point because I wish to tell him that some Labour Members of the Committee are troubled not by the arguments that have been put forward so far, but by another point. I tried to interrupt the Parliamentary Secretary four times, so that he could explain the matter to us while he was on his feet.<br><br>
I an confused by many statements made in the clause. What sticks in my throat is that the traffic commissioners have one set of obligations to those with standard licences, and a different set of obligations to those with restricted licences. One must refer to subsections (1) and (2). The first part of subsection (1) reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"The traffic commissioners by whom a standard licence was granted shall revoke the licence"</p></blockquote>
and so on. That is a reference to standard licences. The subsection refers to a person being
<br><blockquote><p>"of good repute, the requirement to be of appropriate financial standing or the requirement as to professional competence".</p></blockquote>
All that reads as if it refers to standard licences. But the notes of explanation provided by the Ministry—they are of great assistance—state:
<br><blockquote><p>"The distinction between standard and restricted licences is retained and professional competence is required only of standard licence holders."</p></blockquote>
But listen to this:
<br><blockquote><p>"Good repute, financial standing"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman may have an opportunity to make a speech later. At the moment he is supposed to be making an intervention.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think it is entirely a matter for my discretion. When the hon.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because the hon. Gentleman was taking too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. So the actual intervention is determined by the length of time that one takes. My experience of reading other Committee reports is that there is a considerable difference in the interpretations by Chairmen of what might be considered the correct length of time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Prescott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take it from your nodding assent that that is so, and that we depend on the reasonableness or generosity of the Chairman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I might also add that hon. Gentlemen seem to forget that we are in Committee. In Committee there is less need than in the House to make interventions because hon. Members are entitled to speak more than once. On the Floor of the House interventions have to be allowed more frequently because an hon. Member may wish to make a point that he cannot make in another speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) during his intervention is both serious and difficult. I admit that while I had been siezed of the two points on whether there should be equality of treatment between the restricted and full licence holder, and the judgment about the discretion of the commissioner, I had not, as my hon. Friend has clearly done, seen the relationship between the two. I do not intend, therefore, to deal with that point during my present speech. However, I realise the importance of the point and hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Ipswich will be able to develop it later. I do not want it thought that I am detracting from the importance of the point by not dealing with it now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might save the hon. Member for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) from preparing his speech if he reads clause 20(1) which gives the requirements of a standard licence and of a restricted
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1174</span>
licence. That was debated by the Com mittee on Tuesday last.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That only shows that the Parliamentary Secretary has missed the point raised by my hon. Friend. We know the difference between the conditions for standard licences and those for restricted licences. My hon. Friend was making the point that there is clearly a relationship between how discretion is exercised and whether discretion is being exercised in relation to standard licences only, to standard licences and restricted licences in the same area, or whether the discretion should be exercised differently in respect of either. But that is not the issue I wish to deal with now.<br><br>
I seek to tackle the difficult issue relating to the traffic commissioner. I make it clear to the Parliamentary Secretary that I am not criticising him or the Minister insofar as they are seeking to include in the Bill an area of discretion for the commissioner. Of course it is right that the commissioner should have that. We, and certainly those working in the industry, appreciate that the circumstances in which a business ceases to have a manager who is competent within the definition of the Bill—if I can put it in that shorthand form—to operate the business, are such that sometimes it would be right to revoke an application and at other times it would be right to suspend one. That much is simple, given the examples that have been deployed.<br><br>
12.15p.m.<br><br>
However, there are other examples where the matter is much more difficult. A manager may have fallen ill—had a heart attack, perhaps—and may be out of action for a considerable time. The commissioner will have to consider whether there is someone else in the business who, while not competent within the legal terms of the Bill, nevertheless, is sufficiently competent in the manager's judgment to carry on the business for a period.<br><br>
That is difficult, because in the strictest terms there must come a time when it would be illegal for the business to go on running under somebody who the commissioner regarded as generally competent but who did not have "competence" within the strict terms of the Bill.<br><br>
The Parliamentary Secretary and his hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), when we discussed the definition of the legal competence to run a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0641">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1175</span>
business, made it clear that they did not feel that the EEC definition was particularly good. For all I know—this is something that might be better judged by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), who has considerable EEC parliamentary experience— that may have been one of the reasons why, when the EEC came to make the directive, and article 3.1 in particular, they left the wider discretion to individual States.<br><br>
Having said that, I am not convinced by the Parliamentary Secretary's argument that the discretion should be complete, controlled only by the term "reasonable", so to speak. I am also not convinced that one can justify "may" as opposed to "shall"—again, that puts matters in a shorthand form—in subsection (2), merely on the ground that a reasonable judgment will be made by the traffic commissioner.<br><br>
I think it right that Parliament should strive at this stage for a way of circumscribing and restricting matters, and pointing out to the commissioners when they come to make that difficult judgment the sort of factors that we want them to take into account. That is particularly true when we are conscious that we are working within an area of derogation of an EEC directive. The EEC, of which we are a part, has decided that that should be left in the area of domestic legislation in each country. Therefore, I believe that we must go on to consider whether we impose limits, whether we limit it in some other way or whether—as the amendment suggests—we require the traffic commissioner, to make his judgment subject to article 3.1 and not in the light of article 5.2. That is a very guide. Unlike the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), traffic commissioners probably have read articles 3.1 and 5.2 before we came to this debate. They will realise the significant difference.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moate</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As someone who took part in the debates on the directive in the last Parliament, when the right hon. Gentleman's Government were introducing regulations that were pretty well on all fours with this, I should like to point out that many of us are familiar with the matter. Indeed, the right hon. Gentleman's point could have been made in about one minute flat, instead of the 1 hour and 50 minutes that he and his colleagues have taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1176</span>
a number of presumptions and I do not know that they are justified. To begin with, I do not believe that he is justified in presuming that the debate on this EEC directive has given clear guidance on whether we should enshrine in our domestic law the requirement for a traffic commissioner to have regard to articles 3.1 or 5.2 or both. Certainly, it did not sufficiently guide the Ministers in charge of the Bill to enable them to come to the Committee this morning with a clear view as to the relevance of the two paragraphs.<br><br>
I accept, of course, that in the course of the debate the Parliamentary Secretary has looked at the directive and formed a view on how far they are relevant, but that is not the same thing at all and we have not finished with the arguments on these points.<br><br>
I now turn to the second important issue raised by the three amendments that are grouped together and I shall leave aside the argument on amendment No. 179. Given that the commissioner is to have that degree of discretion to which amendment No. 180 seeks to limit him, the question is raised whether he should be required to treat equally the holders of standard and restricted licences.<br><br>
It is clear from the first line of clause 22 that the Minister has now formed a view on that issue which is that the traffic commissioners should deal with that question only in the case of standard licence holders. Therefore, one may assume that there could be considerable difficulty for the person holding a provisional licence. We know, of course, that the holder of the restricted licence is not required to have a manager who is professionally qualified.<br><br>
I put it to the Committee that if the licence to operate is withdrawn on any grounds, the same problems of running the business will arise. If one's operator's licence is withdrawn, even if it is a restricted licence, that can still cause the closure of the business and the employees to be thrown out of work and might force that business into bankruptcy. Therefore, it must be recognised that article 1.3 of the EEC directive commits member States to
<br><blockquote><p>"exempt from the application of all or some of the provisions of this Directive natural persons or undertakings engaged exclusively in road passenger transport services for non-commercial purposes or having a main occupation other than that of road passenger transport operator, in so far as their transport operations have only a minor impact on the transport market."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0642">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1177</span>
That is totally relevant to our considerations because three-quarters of that part of article 1.3 accords absolutely with the way in which we make the distinction between the standard licence and the restricted licence. Therefore, that must affect the judgment. If the EEC in its wisdom takes the view that there should be that distinction, I believe that we are under some obligation to consider that.<br><br>
Incidentally, as I understand matters, the EEC did not define what it meant by the words
<br><blockquote><p>"a minor impact on the transport market".</p></blockquote>
I believe that we may interpret that in terms of our own experience, but it is clear that the EEC was making a similar distinction to that made in the Bill between those operating wholly and exclusively in road passenger transport services for commercial purposes and those so engaged for non-commercial purposes. The EEC also made a distinction such as is made in the Bill for those who have only a minor part of their operations in the sphere of transport.<br><br>
Therefore, one has to make a judgment, given that someone can be running a fairly extensive passenger transport undertaking in terms of restricted licences. I welcome the chance to join forces here with what was said the other night by the hon. Member for Faversham—that, in these matters, we should not be guided too much by commercial considerations but should always remember the safety of the passengers and whether they are in a vehicle being run for profit or not. On that I am one with him and I think his point is relevant to the clause.<br><br>
If someone is running a substantial undertaking under a restricted licence and that licence is withdrawn, it would have a special impact. That operator should have an equal claim to consideration under the commissioners' discretion. If the commissioners are to have discretion, it should not be limited to the standard licence holder. The factors to be taken into account in the exercise of that discretion can be equally valid in certain cases for restricted licence holders.<br><br>
They could be relevant, for instance, in the case of a local authority. It may have a transport manager who runs a number of undertakings for it—perhaps running buses for the social services department to bring handicapped people to various local facilities. That manager would not require a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1178</span>
certificate of professional competence under the Bill. But the authority would have to have a restricted licence. If it lost that restricted licence, the impact on its services, which might be vital to certain people, would be severe.<br><br>
If we want to use these criteria for the standard and restricted licences, and those in article 1.3 of the EEC directive regarding whether a transport operation makes a major or minor impact on the national market—even the larger public service operators have only a minor impact on the total public transport operation, but, in logic, they must relate their operations to their impact upon the local and not the national scene—we must realise that they could exempt almost anything from compliance with the provisions—even a community bus, because it would have only a minor impact upon the market.<br><br>
It is necessary to apply some common sense to ensure that the public receive the best level of overall service. That will not be achieved by allowing a multitude of pin-pricking operations with relaxed standards to compete in the wider network of services. I do not want it to be thought that I believe that we should protect operators at any cost. Far from it. We should seek to protect the public by ensuring that standards are maintained in the public transport industry, whether it is run by the private or public sector.<br><br>
With that in mind, and following the spirit of the EEC directive, we should try to ensure equality of opportunity for those who operate with the two standards of licence. The amendment seeks, properly, to place the holder of a restricted licence on the same footing as the holder of a standard licence when he falls below the standards provided for in the Bill. Those standards must be supposed by us, if by no one else, to have been put there for a very good reason. There is no real logic in a distinction between the standard and the provisional licence holder in those circumstances.<br><br>
If the standard licence holder fails to meet the requirements of the legislation by losing his manager, I agree that the traffic commissioners should have some discretion. But I can put an equally good argument at length—I shall not, but I could—why the same consideration should apply in a whole range of circumstances affecting those operating important services on restricted licences. The Minister has not

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 189, in page 21, line 28, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>aa</i>) that 5 per cent., or such percentage as the Minister may determine by regulation, of the vehicles of a licence holder have, on inspection by a certifying officer or public service vehicle examiner, been notified as unfit for service within the preceding six months.".</p></blockquote>
This amendment, in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) and me,</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1180</span>
<p>man is principal representative of the Opposition in this Committee and he must make the decision.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that I must make the decision, Mr. English. I had not appreciated that I must make it without hearing the arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Boscawen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. We have spent two hours debating the amendment. The right hon. Gentleman does not appear to want to withdraw it.<br><br>
I therefore beg to move, that the question be now put.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the question be now put:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 11, Noes 8.</p>
<p>amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 10.</p>
<p>seeks to introduce a provision that is aimed at limiting what might be described as the persistent or systematic failings of an undertaking.</p>
<p>Some of the grounds for action set out in subsection (4) seem to be highly technical. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) for instance, reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"that the holder of the licence made or procured to be made for the purposes of his application … a statement of fact which … was false, or a statement of intention or expectation which has not been fulfilled".</p></blockquote></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0644">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1181</span>
<p>Those might be described as technical shortcomings in the way in which the applicant set about obtaining the licence. They are important, but they relate to procedure. Admittedly, in some circumstances the procedural fault might amount to fraud, but it is nevertheless a procedural fault. The person, having obtained the licence, may be in breach of paragraph (<i>a</i>) but still be a highly satisfactory operator of a public passenger transport business, but for that fraud or error.<br><br>
In other words, he might be running a fleet of buses in a highly competent way and fulfilling all the other obligations upon him. I do not, of course, suggest for one moment that subsection 4(<i>a</i>) should not be a ground for action by the traffic commissioners against that person. Clearly, we must guard against that kind of offence. Some of the other grounds for action are similar.<br><br>
Some of the grounds are very broadly drawn. I am not sure about this. I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say. Amendment No. 189 is a probing amendment, but it is a serious probe. Therefore, in the event of the Parliamentary Secretary not conceding the principle of some provision of this kind, we may wish to press the matter to a Division.<br><br>
It seemed to us that, despite all the regulations that may be issued by the Minister, and despite all the provisions of the Bill so far, if they finally pass into law, a company or municipal undertaking could continue to run its fleet despite a substantial number of shortcomings in its vehicles forcing them to be taken out of service by the certifying officers or public service vehicle examiners, and yet nothing would be done about that.<br><br>
It may be argued that the owner or board of the company or the committee of the local authority which runs the undertaking would take action if the number of shortcomings in the vehicles meant that a substantial number of them were continually unfit for service. My hon. Friend and I, however, felt that this should not be left to the discretion of the owners of the undertaking, whether it be in the private or public sector. We believe that this matter should be directly within the purview of the traffic commissioners.<br><br>
It might be argued that subsection 4(<i>b</i>) would enable something along those lines to be enforced. I am not sure about that. Certainly it is possible that paragraph (<i>c</i>)
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1182</span>
has some bearing on the provision that we seek to introduce.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the question of vehicles being unfit for service is of sufficient significance to be highlighted in the Bill. When we discussed clause (1) everyone agreed that, besides preparing a statute that directly sets out the law, we were providing certain clauses in the statute partly in order to demonstrate that Parliament holds certain things to be of importance. It is worth while spelling out directly and specifically that the safety of vehicles is of great importance.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Booth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend turns to that aspect, may I intervene? He has raised the question whether a commissioner could, under subsection 4(<i>b</i>), do what the amendment would undoubtedly allow him to do? However, it is reasonable to read subsection 4(<i>b</i>) as applying only to contraventions of the conditions attached to licences. Whether having unfit vehicles would contravene the conditions of a licence would depend on whether they were used. Am I right in thinking that my hon. Friend's argument was based on the understanding that it would not be a contravention to have an unfit vehicle in the depot but only to try to run it in service?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may well be the case. My hon. Friend and I do not have the benefit of Ministry of Transport staff passing us notes advising us about where we stand on various amendments. We are therefore somewhat in the dark. However, I am prepared to believe that one of the more general provisions in subsection (4) might cover the ground that the amendment seeks to cover. I am not sure that that is the case. I am seeking reassurance from the Parliamentary Secretary.<br><br>
Even if it is the case, my hon. Friend and I believe that it needs to be spelt out that if a substantial proportion of available vehicles are unfit for service within a given period the point may be reached when a licence will be withdrawn, revoked, varied or suspended. That is most important.<br><br>
The amendment aims to ensure that no public passenger transport undertaking systematically falls short of the legal requirements for the fitness for service of vehicles. We all know of organisations which just about manage to get by in such matters. Instead of aiming to get a first-rate record of vehicle safety and fitness, they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0645">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1183</span>
aim simply to get by. The object of the amendment is to ensure that they do a lot more than get by. It will strengthen the hand both of the owners—the transport manager's bosses—and of the transport manager himself. It will enable both to say, "We have had far too many vehicles declared unfit for service in the last year. If we are not careful we shall get the whole kaboosh shut down because we are not meeting safety standards well or consistently enough."<br><br>
This important matter should be spelt out in the Bill, instead of being disguised—if indeed it is there at all—in the generalities of the other paragraphs of subsection (4).</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have said many times in Committee, we do not legislate for the 98 per cent. of operators who are genuine in their approach. We legislate against the possible 2 per cent. who would try to break the rules—the cowboy operators.<br><br>
One can argue that subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) covers the point of the amendment. I listened to what the Minister said because he had the courtesy to listen to me but, with great respect, I do not know what he means. It could be read that subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) would apply only in the instance set out in the amendment if the traffic commissioner made a condition in the original application for a licence in relation to unfit vehicles. That may or not be the case. As so many things in the Bill are unspecified, we seek to specify exactly.<br><br>
One can argue that traffic commissioners should have some flexibility. No one is against that, but there should also be guidelines. If we seek to impose a deterrent —rightly, we hear so much about the safety of the public—it is equally important that the operator knows that a condition under which he could lose his licence is that of unfit vehicles.<br><br>
We know that there are penalties for that. We are saying that they should be made specific. We have left it open to the Minister to decide. We have suggested
<br><blockquote><p>"… 5 per cent., or such percentage as the Minister may determine by regulation, of the vehicles of a licence holder have, on inspection by a certifying officer or public service vehicle examiner".</p></blockquote>
We have been open about that and, I think, generous. We could have been more specific, but we thought that if we suggested
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1184</span>
5 per cent. the Minister might go lower or, if given the opportunity, go higher. There would be that flexibility.<br><br>
The Minister may say that this is covered in schedule 3. I will not stray to that, but it is necessary to mention, as the Minister undoubtedly will, that schedule 3(1)(<i>a</i>) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"the previous conduct of that person in relation to any business involving the operation of vehicles of any description, being a business".</p></blockquote>
That means that the traffic commissioner looks at previous records, but it is not specific. We seek to make this conclusive and to let an operator know from the time he first has the licence that one of the areas where he is at risk of losing the licence is that of unfit vehicles.<br><br>
That in itself is a great deterrent, because the operator knows immediately that if a public service vehicle examiner inspects his vehicles and finds them unfit—or the percentage agreed by the Minister in regulation unfit, he risks losing his licence.<br><br>
The key word is "risks". The genuine operator will not put himself at risk. He will ensure that all his vehicles are 100 per cent. safe, particularly when, by losing his licence, he could go out of business. If a deterrent means anything, fundamentally it is that. It is no use using empty words or inflicting a penalty if it is not made to stick. The amendment, if carried, would make it stick.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister will agree that the genuine operator has nothing whatever to fear from the amendment. It is the unscrupulous operator whom we seek to watch and cover.<br><br>
With the greatest respect to the Minister, the Bill does not do that. It is a lawyers' paradise. I foresee a number of lawyers clapping their hands when the Bill becomes an Act and saying, "There is my employment for the next 30 years." The Bill is so unspecific that one would think that it had been thrown together by lawyers for lawyers until the end of time. If anything will guarantee employment for the legal profession it is this Bill.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will look at that matter in detail and not give a frivolous answer on how it is covered. I further hope that he will refer to subsection (4)(<i>b</i>) because my mind is clear on the interpretation to be found there, and, obviously, I do not have the backing of a battery of civil servants who can pass notes to me in the Committee. I have to proceed with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0646">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1185</span>
best intentions and read the Bill as a layman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Penhaligon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is making an interesting point, but is he saying that a small rural operator with only three buses who has one bus fail in 10 years should be driven out of business?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly what I am not saying, as the hon. Gentleman would know if he read the words in the amendment:
<br><blockquote><p>"been notified as unfit for service within the preceding six months".</p></blockquote>
There is no danger to the small rural operator if the amendment is accepted. If that wording is in the Bill the rural operator will know that if he has unfit vehicles he will lose his licence, so he will not have unfit vehicles in his business. But without that wording that small rural operator could well have unfit vehicles. If the question is posed, whether we are concerned about unfit vehicles, and we answer "Yes", what are we to do about unfit vehicles? Are we to do nothing about them or are we to add a clause specifying a penalty for an unfit vehicle? Shall we decide that an operator with an unfit vehicle shall not lose his licence, or that even if he has 10 or 15 vehicles and pays a penalty for his unfit vehicles his licence shall remain safe? Is that the deterrent about which we are talking? If that is the case, why not do away with it altogether since that makes nonsense?<br><br>
If an operator applies for a licence and knows that if he has unfit vehicles that will be a condition by which he will lose his livelihood, there is no doubt that greater care will be taken to ensure that there are no unfit vehicles under such conditions. If that is not incorporated in the Bill we shall have an unspecified area, but if it is incorporated are we not tying down the traffic commissioners? I do not believe that we are. We shall be giving them a line under which they can operate to deal with a matter about which the House is concerned—namely, the danger to the public from unfit vehicles. We are concerned about that. We shall be giving the traffic commissioners an extra power by legislation.<br><br>
Schedule 3 lists things that traffic commissioners should consider, such as appropriate financial standing, professional competence and good repute, and gives them
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1186</span>
specific guidelines and areas. Under the heading of "Good repute", schedule 3(1)(<i>a</i>)(i) refers to a business:
<br><blockquote><p>"carried on by him or by a company of which he is… a director",</p></blockquote>
and paragraph (<i>a</i>)(ii) uses the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of which he is … employed"</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (1)(<i>b</i>) refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"any relevant convictions of that person, or of any employee or agent of his, during the preceding five years."</p></blockquote>
The Minister saw fit to lay down such guidelines. I am not quibbling or saying that they should not be there; they should be. They give the traffic commissioner some sort of remit over the matters that he examines when making a judgment. Would it not be logical to table amendments such as ours that relate specifically to the traffic commissioner's remit over unfit vehicles?<br><br>
We are not saying that if just one operator—such as the small rural operator who was mentioned—has one unfit vehicle in two years he should go out of business. We are being specific. In fact, if the Bill had been specific, we would not have needed the amendment. Most of our amendments are trying to be more specific and make sense of a Bill of which a large part is nonsense.<br><br>
If we were to say that a small rural operator who has one unfit vehicle in the past two years should go out of business that would be nonsense. We use the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"notified as unfit for service within the preceding six months."</p></blockquote>
By that, we are seeking to put in a deterrent which will stop some people. I am not talking about a figure of 98 per cent., because large undertakings will not be concerned.<br><br>
There is another line of argument. Large undertakings will welcome the proposal, because it will protect them against the cowboy operators. The large companies will have nothing to be concerned about. They will look after their vehicles. We are legislating for the 2 per cent. of cowboy operators.<br><br>
When the Minister replies, I hope that he does not use the argument that, to some extent, he has already done today and tell us that it is covered by something un-specific, such as a person's previous
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1979-1980V011P0I0647">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1187</span>
conduct. That covers a multitude of sins and virtues. The matter is not at all specific. The schedule refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>"the previous conduct of that person in relation to any business involving the operation of vehicles of any description being a business".</p></blockquote>
If that is not gobbledegook and cannot be torn to shreds in a court of law, I shall stand here all day. [<i>Hon. Members:</i> "You will."] In fact, I shall not stand here all day, but only till 1 o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman may stand there if he wishes. The Committee, however, will adjourn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cowans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to hold the fort for the Committee provided that I am released on its return. We often have to hold the fort. Indeed, on one or two occasions we have been so concerned about the Bill—as we have been all along—that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1188</span>
we have provided the quorum. If we had not been here, all the concern—or lack of it—expressed from the Government side of the Committee would not have been discussed.<br><br>
I cannot see how the Minister can quarrel with the amendment in any way. I shall be interested to hear what he says about whether the figure should be 5 per cent., or a larger or lesser percentage. It would be interesting to understand the reason if that goes down. If there is a lesser percentage, will people outside the House of Commons read that as a lack of concern for the public? I hope not, because I am sure that the Minister shares our concern for the travelling public.</span></p>
<p><i>It being One o'clock</i> The CHAIRMAN <i>adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly till this day at half-past Four o'clock.</i></p>
