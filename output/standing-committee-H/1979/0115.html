	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 33, leave out "(other than a tramcar)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we will consider amendment No. 17, in page 2, line 34, after "tramcar", insert "or trolley bus".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We turn now to the trolley bus exemption. Amendment No. 16 was one of the amendments tabled before we received the explanatory notes from the Minister and when we had difficulties over the timing of the Committee. Therefore, we do not intend to cause delay. A considerable number of amendments have already been selected by you, Mr. English, and a number have been tabled by the Minister himself, which, I feel, justifies our argument at the beginning of the Committee that a certain amount of time was necessary in which to consider the implications of the Bill. Certainly the Minister's awareness of that is reflected in the amendments he has tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16 was originally tabled as a probing amendment to elicit why the Minister wanted to exempt the trolley bus while leaving tramways in the clause defining a public service vehicle. We were helped to some extent by the Minister's notes which showed his thinking about certain parts of clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the only justification given for the exclusion of trolley buses from the exemption in respect of public service vehicles is that the exclusion is vacuous. That word is defined as meaning empty, without meaning and not reasonably justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to accept that, as I understand it, there are no trolley buses trundling around our transport system at present, but I have received a number of letters from people wanting a return of the trolley bus. Whether that would be justified,
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
bearing in mind the large number of rails and poles associated with trolley buses, is a matter for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In excluding trolley buses from the exemption does the Minister consider that trolley buses may come back, and that, if they do, they will be treated as public service vehicles. He should not close his eyes to the fact that the development of the transportation system may well bring with it new types of trolley buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is an implied assumption that it will come back as a public service vehicle. For example, it could be assumed to be a trolley bus that carried more than nine persons, not a trolley taxi or a trolley car or whatever. Developments in the transportation system are becoming rapid and, with the development of atomic energy a cheaper system may be developed to run on electricity, so all possibilities should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1960 Act mentions "a trolley vehicle". When that legislation was enacted trolley buses were still in existence. Therefore it was necessary to make clear that a trolley vehicle was exempted from the definition of a public service vehicle. However, if they existed today they might well be considered to be public service vehicles for the purposes of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition of "trolley vehicle" in the Road Traffic Act 1960 is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a mechanically propelled vehicle adapted for use upon roads without rails and moved by power transmitted thereto from some external source;" "External source" is perhaps the operative phrase. One so readily assumes that the power of the trolley system was derived from rails or wires on poles carried above the road surface, the trolley bus merely using the roads as the means of travel but powered by an external source.</p></blockquote>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) and I visited the Tyne and Wear transport authority last week. It last used trolley buses in 1966. The major disadvantage of the system at the time, when most bus authorities were discontinuing trolley buses, was the costly maintenance of miles of wires and poles and the high and increasing cost of electricity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the distinction that the Minister has drawn between trains and trolley buses it is easy to distinguish between the kind of transport system that runs on rails and the trolley bus, which was a kind of motor vehicle but was powered from an external source. One can see why there should be separate legislation for railways, but it is perhaps not equally
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
clear why trolley vehicles should have the same exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth referring here to a debate which took place in 1930, when with the 1930 Act 50 years of Socialist legislation was born. In the main, that legislation has not changed. In fact, this Bill does not greatly change the thinking behind that Act on public service vehicles. In the debate on 1 May 1930, the Opposition moved an amendment to include trolley vehicles in the definition of the public service vehicle and in the definition to be covered by the commissioners in determining the fares—that is, to be the same as a motor vehicle. However, that amendment was rejected, and the reason given by Herbert Morrison, as he then was, made clear why the Government refused to include both trolley buses and tramways in the definition of a public service vehicle. Herbert Morrison said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a very good reason why tramcars and trolley vehicles should not be in this part of the Bill. They are both of them statutory undertakings run in direct pursuance of Parliamentary powers, and as a rule regulations can be made by the Minister of Transport governing them…Therefore, clearly…they cannot run except under direct statutory powers, and it is not proposed that they should run other than by statutory authority"—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee C;</i> 1 May 1930, c.884.]</p></blockquote>
As I think the Minister will agree, there were of course separate powers for dealing with those matters and so that might have been correct at that time. The argument now presented to us is that as no trolley buses exist it seems a little irrelevant to include them in the exemption from this power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe—as the Minister recognises in his notes—that trolley buses will develop. In fact, a number of hybrid systems are beginning to develop. For example the rather excellent transit system in the Tyne and Wear area could be considered a combination of a rail and bus system. At the Derby engineering works —which I know the Minister, too, has visited—work is proceeding on a kind of bus on rail. So a number of different transport systems are being developed which in the past have been dealt with by different pieces of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a development in the future may well be a trolley bus which was originally considered as a hybrid vehicle. I think that when it was originally brought in it was referred to as the trackless tram. So
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
the borderline between different types of transport is often crossed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the first Committees on which my right hon. Friend and I sat related to legislation on the hovercraft. That was a combination of road, aircraft and maritime legislation applied to an entirely different means of transportation. We did not try to force it into any one of those. It carried across all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may see the development of a trolley bus system in the future, particularly as its main means of power would be electricity. As the Government are making clear, and not without some point, the development of electricity from nuclear energy will be a major source of power for future transport systems. It may come from battery sources, but may also come from an external application of power—perhaps a single wire—which would not involve massive maintenance costs as did the old application of power by poles to two sets of lines, and so on. Again one would not want to treat that kind of vehicle— because of its different means of external power—as a public service vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, a trolley bus system may come into being, but as there is none in evidence now, it is argued that we should take it out of the list of exemptions. But if trolley buses were introduced, we think that the definition of "public service vehicle" would be sufficient. Without the amendment fresh legislation might be needed at that time, but if the amendment were accepted it would be sufficient to leave things as they are and to conduct experiments under existing legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to the example of the flexi-bus in south Yorkshire. That was, by our definition, considered to be a trailer bus. The Government could not give permission for it to be used as a public service vehicle to carry fare paying passengers. It is being used in south Yorkshire today as a passenger carrying bus because exemptions can be made under existing legislation to enable passengers to be carried, but not to be charged. That bus is now trundling around successfully on the south Yorkshire system in Sheffield. It is an expanding system and well accepted by those driving and operating the buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This legislation will change that. It recognises that trailers can be used as public service vehicles and the anomaly will not continue. But it shows how we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
must adjust existing legislation to meet new developments in transportation systems. If the only argument for not exempting trolley buses is that there are none presently, why not exempt them? It will create no difficulty for any other legislation and may give the Minister greater flexibility when the newly developing trolley bus is considered in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a point that may appear to indicate that I take a slightly different view from my hon. Friend. We do not want to spend much time on this subject, but we want to ensure that we are not passing up an opportunity to make proper provision for the development of new types of trolley bus in the future. Can the Minister specifically confirm that he intends, by leaving out the exemption, to ensure that any trolley bus that is developed in the future will be within the definition of public service vehicle, or that it would have to meet the test—which would possibly be a better way of putting it—of a public service vehicle under clause 2?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, I can understand why it might be desirable. I can also see why it might be thought desirable—although we should like to hear the evidence—that trolley buses of the future should not be subject to the sort of tramway legislation, or local legislation as was often the case, that applied in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I become somewhat suspicious of people who argue that they are making changes in transport systems on purely economic grounds, or through purely economic reasoning. When questioned, they often use their economic argument to justify their social or technological preferences. I have even come across an instance on Tyneside of the justification for the withdrawal of the electric loco in favour of the diesel multiple unit on economic grounds, at the same time as electric trains are being introduced to the South-Eastern region, on the ground that they are more economical than the diesel multiple units that they are replacing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since my hon. Friend has raised the question of the economic justifications advanced for the withdrawal of the trolley bus, I should like the Minister to give us his view on two points. Does he accept that in the future we may wish to see a return to electric vehicles in place of oil-consuming vehicles, purely on the ground of the strategic need to conserve oil for
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
those vehicles that cannot be replaced in that way? If so, is the Minister satisfied that allowing this definition in clause 2 to replace the old definitions relating to trolley buses will suffice, or will there be the danger, through construction legislation or any other sort, that a new type of trolley bus could be caught, not by this definition but by a provision such as that mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) which caught the flexi-bus. Will other definitions have to be made? Has the Minister, in deciding on the change that he proposes—for which, we admit, there may be a very good reason—satisfied himself that there is no other legislation lying around that might prevent a new type of trolley bus being introduced, even if it met the definition in clause 2?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of his speech on Second Reading, the Minister stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall now have legislation governing passenger transport designed for the conditions of the 1980s" —[	<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1979; Vol. 974, c.1133.]</p></blockquote>
I am not at all sure that we shall have the broad legislation that will cover all the contingencies that may arise in public transport over the next decade. In particular, oil supply—irrespective of any other energy problems—will be a world difficulty, even though it will not be a major problem in this country for about half a decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the odds are that the bulk of the transport system towards the end of this decade will be electrically powered, if only because the electricity system can be fed with any form of power supply, Therefore, there can be nuclear power stations—although I am not so enthusiastic about the proposed expansion in the nuclear power programme as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott). Power stations can be nuclear-fired, oil-fired, peat-fired, chicken manure-fired, or almost anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, private motor vehicles will not have that degree of flexibility in the form of their fuel. Consequently it seems predictable that, towards the end of this decade, we shall be extremely dependent on electricity as one of the major sources of motive power for public passenger transport. Public passenger transport will make a come-back, because private pas-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
senger transport will become incapable of being sustained by the ordinary individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, we should be drawing up legislation which would permit whoever is providing public passenger transport—the private undertaking, municipality, the National Bus Company, British Rail or anyone else—to introduce various innovations without new legislation being necessary. They should be able to draw on legislation which is sufficiently up to date to cope with any new vehicles which are introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have talked about the trolley bus, and it seems fairly likely that it will make a come-back. As I understand it, there are doubts whether the definitions included in the Bill are sufficiently broad to cover whatever form of trolley bus may come into use. Simply because there was something called a trolley bus 20 years ago—that was probably when the last one was built, or maybe it was even longer ago—does not mean that what we shall call a trolley bus in the future will necessarily resemble it in construction, appearance or size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to appear too archaic, but it seems to me that there is quite a possibility that the tram will make a come-back also. I believe that the same logic which takes us towards the trolley bus can take us towards the tramcar. It is a scientific fact that steel running on steel is more efficient that a rubber tyre running on tarmac. If in the future we shall be concentrating predominantly on energy saving in transport, there is a fair possibility that the track vehicle taking up road space will come back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott) referred to going to the Derby works and seeing the work being undertaken on the rail bus. Effectively, this is something like a bus chassis with railway bogies fastened to the bottom. That is a very crude description of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, the tramcar was like a battleship in construction. It was extremely heavy because it was a traditional form of construction, produced by a very traditional industry. In this country, it was last produced a long time ago. However, it seems possible that—certainly within the decade that the Minister was foreseeing when he spoke on Second Reading—what might be described as a lightweight tram-
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
car will be introduced in some of the major conurbations in this country as it could easily be the most energy-saving form of vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret to say, although I do not make any apologies, that I have not had the time to look at the present legislation governing tramcars. I do not know whether there is general legislation, or whether it is simply private Acts of Parliament. But it seems to me that if we are discussing some form of lightweight tram-car—that seems to be the most likely form in which it may make a come-back—it could well be that the ancient legislation on which the old ones relied will no longer be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that it is a party political point. My right hon. and hon. Friends and I are not raising it with a view to delaying the passage of the Bill. We genuinely feel that it would be worthwhile for the Minister to have his Department consider, very seriously, extending whatever definitions are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill could then enable various innovations in public transport to be introduced, over the next decade without the need for legislation, or without the problem which practical people in the field may find in building new vehicles when their pursuit of efficiency, saving of materials, weight and energy leads them to produce things which do not fall within the existing tramcar or trolley bus definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will see fit to reconsider this aspect so that we have a law which will enable people in the field to respond in an imaginative and flexible way to the problems that will face them in six, seven or 10 years' time without having to come back to this House or without being able to make excuses. This last matter is important, because public transport is absolutely ruined by the ability of the people operating it to make excuses about their failure to provide a decent service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not leave the management of various public transport bodies in a position where they can say "We cannot introduce these innovations safely or cheaply within the law, because the law is stopping us, and we shall have to wait for legislation which will take another 18 months or two years". Of course, they would be dead right about that, because the ability of this place to respond to technological change is notoriously poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On all counts I believe that the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
should make sure that this piece of legislation enables this degree of flexibility in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT (Mr. Norman Fowler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and valuable, though short, debate. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) raised the matter of tramcars, which I believe is important. Secondly, there is the matter of trolley buses. Both are dealt with in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport policy and legislation in the past have divided passenger transport into two distinct and separate categories—the bus and the train. Many other countries, particularly those on the Continent, have recognised and encouraged an intermediate form—the tram, as the hon. Gentleman suggested. Instead of abandoning street tramways, as we in this country have done, with one notable exception which I shall come to, they have upgraded them into modern, light, rapid transit which provides a fast, clean and energy-efficient form of transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much welcome what the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South said on this issue. I, too, see a future role for rapid transit, particularly in the conurbations where new transport facilities are needed but where full-scale railways are too costly. Indeed, there are examples. I have a pamphlet listing examples of systems throughout Western Europe, particularly in Germany. There is one light, rapid transit system in Amsterdam in the Netherlands of which hon. Members may be aware. Our one remaining tramway system is that in Blackpool on which I imagine most hon. Members have had the privilege of riding at one time or another. Perhaps I am the only member of the Committee who has actually had the privilege of driving the tram in Blackpool. However interesting I would find a general debate on tram-ways, I do not think that this is the right time and place for it, nor would I want to introduce new legislation in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can explain the present legislative position to hon. Members. Tram-cars were excluded from the definition of a public service vehicle in the Road Traffic Act 1930, but, as was said by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott), they are controlled under
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
the Tramways Act 1870 and under local legislation. The powers to operate are strictly related to fixed routes. Much of the bus licensing system is therefore irrelevant to tramway operations
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take the view—and I think that it is a common one—that the law on tramways cannot easily be blended with the PSV law. In my view, therefore, we must distinguish between the law affecting tramways—the Tramways Act 1870 and the various local Acts—and the bus licensing laws. We must not confuse the two systems. Opposite hon. Members may consider that the tramway law needs to be reformed at some future date, but we must still take account of it and avoid any possible confusion between it and the bus licensing law. I therefore hope that the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East will seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of trolley buses, again I certainly respond to the comments of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South. It is possible that there could be developments in that area. At the moment, however, no trolley buses are operating in Great Britain. The proposed exclusion of these vehicles from the PSV definition is therefore irrelevant to the present situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should trolley buses reappear in the future, it is likely to be in a form which will enable them to run for part of the route on batteries, without overhead wires. From an operational point of view they would have a flexibility approaching that of the motor bus. It therefore seems sensible for them to be subject to controls similar to those on other public service vehicles. Indeed, in direct response to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South, I say that I think that that is probably simpler and less likely to place obstacles in the way of such a system developing than any alternative course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that with that explanation hon. Members will be content with the system as it stands. I think that it is sensible and provides for any developments which may take place in the future. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will not seek to press amendment No. 17.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's answer illustrates his own thinking on this matter, but I not sure that it justifies maintaining the present position. I did not spend a great deal of time on the tramcar argu-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
ment, as it is clear that the two amendments taken together are really probing amendments. One can more easily accept the argument with regard to tramcars than the argument with regard to trolley buses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members have mentioned rapid transit systems in other countries. Those systems are highly subsidised, far more so than anything proposed in the Bill or in other legislation before the House. Perhaps we are therefore not in the same game of achieving such modern rapid mass transit systems, as they apparently require to be very heavily subsidised, whatever the political policies applying in the countries where they operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, we should be prepared to withdraw the amendment on tramways. That makes sense and is in line with our arguments. With regard to trolley buses, however, despite the Minister's argument, these operate on fixed rail systems and are therefore less flexible than buses from the point of view of allowing the competition and flexibility that he wishes to introduce into the Bill. There is considerable inflexibility about a trolley bus when it is connected to the overhead line. It does not make a great deal of difference whether the line is above or below. Indeed, I am told that there used to be problems if drivers forgot this when overtaking. The connection with the external power supply became very evident to the driver in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument that was used to justify keeping trams in the system can therefore be used to justify keeping trolley buses in the system. They do not have the same flexibility as buses. Indeed, even with regard to trams, if the Minister believes in competition so much, one might have expected him to be seeking some means to allow anyone who so wished to compete with the Blackpool tramway system. I presume that that system is provided by Blackpool corporation. If competing transport systems are assumed to be to the advantage of all the people, is the Minister not expecting applications to compete with the tramways on those routes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same argument applies to trolley buses. I doubt whether the Minister will see many cowboy operators as the Opposition might consider them to be buying a trolley bus system complete with all the wires and poles, in order to compete with
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
other systems. But that would achieve the central aim of the Minister's Bill—competition, which would bring about flexibility and benefit the consumer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gary Waller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman take into account that any system dependent on overhead wires is extremely wastful of energy? It is accepted by some that half the energy is wasted. Any developments in this field are likely to produce vehicles which would probably not be called trams or trolley buses. Therefore, it would be far better to wait and see what developments are likely before introducing new legislation to take account of those developments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point, and consistent with our argument. Perhaps it is best to leave things as they are, so that there is a broad area of legislation with which to experiment. Our amendment seeks to define as "public service vehicles" vehicles which were not previously treated as such. All the limitations on the definition of public service vehicles, both in the Bill and in other road traffic legislation, restrict developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that no purpose is served by removing the exemption. If the legislation before us can deal with trolley buses, let it. We do not wish to repeat the situation which applied in the case of the flexi-bus. Because a trailer was attached to the bus, it could not be counted as a public service vehicle that could carry fare-paying passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We certainly accept the argument about the high maintenance costs of overhead wires and poles. That was one of the reasons why most people replaced that kind of transport system with what was then a much cheaper source of power—oil and the internal combustion engine. We are at one in that respect. But why take the exemption out? The fact that there are no trolley buses is no reason. It would create no difficulties to retain the exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we do not wish to make a major issue of this. The Minister has not justified the decision to take the exemption out. His notes argue only that there are no trolley buses. We have all accepted that trolley buses may come back in some form, whatever they may be called. We think that the present wording is restrictive, but we shall not go to the stake about it.

	<p>No. 20, in page 2, leave out lines 38 to 43.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 18 is a paving amendment, to make way for amendments Nos. 30 and 20. The three amendments together are intended to improve the Bill, without seeking to change its meaning in any way. Nor do they raise questions of principle about the definition of public service vehicles. We shall come to that argument later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our intention here is to raise the issue whether the definition in subsection (1) (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>)(i) and (ii) is clear, or whether, indeed, it is very clumsy. The wording of our amendments is much simpler and clearer. It leaves no room for ambiguity and overcomes what I believe are certain difficulties in the wording in the Bill. The present wording is unnecessarily complicated, since sub-paragraph (ii) relates exclusively to paragraph (	<i>a</i>). I can see no reason why they should not be combined. If they cannot be combined, the Minister will have to explain how sub-paragraph ii) can relate to anything but paragraph (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, sub-paragraph (i) relates exclusively to paragraph (	<i>b</i>). Since there is no cross-reference it is only sensible to consolidate them, as our amendment proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I carry the argument somewhat further to elicit some information about the construction of the Bill. It is interesting to note that in clause 2 the term "used for carrying passengers" is the mode of construction. But in clause 3 the term "used in the operation of" is employed. I do not know why there should be that difference
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
in the two clauses. It is not crucial to the purpose of the amendment, but it would be interesting to know the reason for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In arguing for a simpler and clearer form of words, I must show that on a purely logical reading of clause 2 there is no justification for sub-paragraph (ii). Paragraph (	<i>a</i>) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"is so used to carry passengers at separate fares in the course of business".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, sub-paragraph (ii),
	<br><blockquote><p>"a vehicle not so adapted whose use is mentioned in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) has been permanently discontinued"</p></blockquote>
must be superfluous. A vehicle which cannot be used because it is permanently discontinued cannot be covered by a definition of "is so used". We should, therefore, get rid of this problem of using the present tense in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) when it is not used in other parts of the Bill, and render unnecessary the repetition in subparagraph (ii).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is undoubtedly a reason for the present construction of the clause. I do not believe that the parliamentary draftsmen or the Minister were merely putting in something superfluous. I believe that the reason is that the Minister intended to make clear that there could be times when a vehicle was a public service vehicle when it was not being used as such. I believe that that is his intention by including in sub-paragraph (ii) the words "has been permanently discontinued". I take it that he is attracted to this formulation and wishes to make that absolutely clear. There could be a temporary discontinuance, or the vehicle could be off the road, but still be subject to the definition and, therefore, to the checks and legislation on public service vehicles. In our amendment, therefore, we have reiterated the words. Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of the amendment reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"passengers are carried at separate fares in the course of a business of carrying passengers and such carriage has not been permanently discontinued."</p></blockquote>
Similarly, paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of the amendment reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the vehicle is adapted to carry more than eight passengers and such use as aforesaid has not been permanently discontinued".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, we retain exactly the meaning which we understand is intended in the Bill. We put it in a much simpler form, so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
that a logical reading does not show part of the definition to be superfluous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time I sought to assist the Minister in this way I was taken to task somewhat, on the ground that I was seeking to set myself up as a judge of the law in the matter. The Minister expressed surprise at an earlier sitting when I quoted other legal opinions of his legislation, so this time I have been meticulously careful to check with some of the people most directly affected by the legislation and with some of their representatives to learn their view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told by the Confederation of Passenger Transport that it takes exactly that view. It favours the amendment because it considers its wording much clearer than that in the original Bill. The Confederation tested it by its normal legal tests and found it to be a preferable form without in any way changing the meaning. Incidentally, this will be helpful to the Minister and to the Committee—the Confederation confirms that it would wish the Bill to be interpreted in a way that would require a public service vehicle to be deemed a public service vehicle even if it was not used in that capacity, provided there was not a permanent discontinuance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To underline the point, the Confederation states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Bad drafting of legislation is a growing problem, not only for those who have to live within the law but those who have to enforce it."</p></blockquote>
The Confederation has some regard there for the Minister's servants. It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Obscurity leads to unnecessary difficulties between enforcement officers and operators and from personal experience CPT can instance occasions where it has had to suggest to…enforcement authorities that summonses which they have issued are not in fact in accordance with the requirements of the law.</p></blockquote>
If enforcement officers can run into difficulties understanding the specific requirements of the law, other citizens can certainly be forgiven for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Confederation further states that the problem has arisen through bad drafting which wastes time and money. It is certainly a waste of enforcement officers' time and therefore it wastes the time and money of the operator who has to respond to the enforcement officers action. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
Confederation states that for these reasons any wording, such as that suggested in the amendment that will simplify and clarify the actual intention is worthwhile. I say all that without in any way expressing my view of the merits of the definition. We must come to that later but we can save time if the Minister will confirm—or deny and state why—that this is the intention, whether the amendments set it out clearly and avoid any doubt as to the scope of the remainder of the clause in respect of public service vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful for the Committee to know that and we could then move on to decide whether we think the definition right or wrong on its merits. It is purely an argument about clarity of statement and intention with a view to assisting those who have to enforce and work within this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY TO THE MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT (Mr. Kenneth Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept immediately that the purpose of the amendment is to be helpful and to try to improve the drafting of the legislation and make its meaning clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the right hon. Member for Barrow-in-Furness (Mr. Booth) that we will consider sympathetically amendments of this kind because we naturally share his concern that the results of our labours, once we have resolved the controversies over policy will be intelligible and useful to the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who has been a practising lawyer all his life, although not in this field, I share entirely the right hon. Gentleman's opinion that bad and obscure drafting of legislation is indeed a problem and shows every sign of getting worse, and anything that we can do in this Bill to try to avoid such dangers is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will accept that amendments of this kind must be approached with care, because we must ensure that in aiming for brevity and terseness of language one is not losing certainty of meaning or creating unforeseen unintentional doubts and confusion for those who have to use the legislation. Elegance and neatness of language are important but even more important is whether or not the result is certainty and clear guidance to enforcement officers, courts and tribunals. The difficulty is that amendment No.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
18—which was described by the hon. Member as a paving amendment for the others—could have the effect of inadvertently changing the meaning by making a public service vehicle a motor vehicle being used for carrying passengers for hire or reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explain the purpose of the present wording of the clause. It is to get over the particular doubt and confusion to which the right hon. Gentleman referred—that is, whether a vehicle is a public service vehicle not only when it is actually being used for the carrying of passengers for hire or reward but when it is temporarily not being so used—for example, when it is in the garage at night when or when it is returning to the depot after a journey in service. Surprising though it may sound, I am told there is a genuine slight doubt about the 1960 Act. It is hoped that the wording in the Bill will clarify the matter and put it beyond doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is arguable that as the 1960 Act stands a vehicle is a public service vehicle only when it is carrying passengers. It would therefore also be arguable that if the word "being" were inserted, as the right hon. Gentleman has suggested, the result might be that it would still be a public service vehicle only while it actually had passengers in it. To take the matter to its extreme, it could be argued that a vehicle would not be a public service vehicle if it happened to have failed to pick up any passengers because nobody was at the stops. Certainly, there would be doubt about a vehicle in a garage making other sorts of journey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not aware that anybody has successfully got away with that argument. However, it is plainly desirable that the matter should be sorted out and made absolutely clear in the Bill. The only practical effect is to establish the powers of vehicle examiners. It would be possible at the moment, or if we raised any doubt in the drafting, for a maverick operator to claim that the vehicle examiners had no power to examine his public service vehicles when they were standing in the garage at night, because they were not being used for the carrying of passengers for hire or reward. We do not want that sort of argument to be maintained. Therefore, we have proposed this form of words, to make clear that it does not matter at all whether a vehicle is in use at the time. It will affect only the position of vehicle examiners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
The thought may cross the minds of hon. Members that as we are now clearly extending the definition of a public service vehicle to buses, even when they have no passengers, that might give rise to difficulties over the licences of their drivers. At present, a vehicle's driver needs the PSV licence only if he is driving it with passengers in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wish to require fitters who may drive an empty bus between depots or for repair to have PSV licences, nor to extend the PSV licensing system to those buses that do not have fare-paying passengers in them at the relevant time. That is covered by another amendment to the Bill. In paragraph 4 of schedule 5 there is a small amendment to section 144 of the 1960 Act, which makes clear that the driver will need the requisite public service vehicle licence only if the vehicle is actually in use as a stage carriage at the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That explains the different wording in clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. In clause 3, the terms "stage carriage", "express carriage" and "contract carriage" are described. The driver must have a PSV licence in all those cases. The requirements of the Bill that extend to the services in those three categories, such as I have already touched on—that is, the need for the driver to have the requisite licence—apply only when the vehicle is being used for the carriage of passengers. They do not extend to a bus that is parked empty or not in use. That explains the different wording and underlines the importance of not putting the word "being", or anything such as that, in clause 2, because the vehicle examiners' powers and the safety requirements concerning the technical condition of the vehicle should not be limited just to those times when it is actually in use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now move to the other amendments and particularly to the substantial amendment No. 30. The second half of the clause explains why so much wording is used on the question of the discontinuance of the adaption to carry passengers or the adaption to a particular use. The reason for this somewhat lengthy and perhaps not altogether elegant wording is to make crystal clear that the temporary discontinuance of the adaptation is not in itself a sufficient reason for refusing the power of the vehicle examiner to examine the vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
Again, one is perhaps anticipating fanciful arguments that might be used by someone who is plainly a maverick operator, but it is possible that someone would try to argue that because for a week or two he was not intending to use the vehicle in the manner described he could therefore refuse the right of a vehicle examiner to examine that vehicle, and that is what we wish to avoid. As I understand matters, the right hon. Gentleman wishes to avoid all these dangers by means of the wording he has chosen, but having looked at his wording, which is an attempt to compress the wording in the Bill, I am advised that our wording is superior because it clearly deals with the two stages. First, it deals with what is a public service vehicle and, secondly, in what circumstances that can cease to be a public service vehicle. Doubt is created if one attempts to merge these, as is suggested. Also, there are some phrases in the suggested improvement which are plainly not suitable. The use of the word "where" is not really the right English or an appropriate word to introduce a phrase such as
	<br><blockquote><p>"adapted to carry more than eight passengers",</p></blockquote>
and the words "such use as aforesaid" form inelegant and legalistic language such as is sometimes used in pleadings before a court, no doubt, but not usually used in legislation and is more jargon, if I may so say with respect to those who drafted the wording, than some of the language in the clause as it now stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I repeat that the clause, although lengthier than the proposed amendments—and I am sure that the Committee prefers always to go for the shorter form wherever possible—has the merit of absolute clarity and separates when a vehicle is a public service vehicle from when it ceases to be a public service vehicle. The clause clarifies the doubts in the 1960 Act about the vehicle being a public service vehicle when it is not actually on the road carrying passengers. As this is an important definition which we must get right, at this stage I advise the Committee to adhere to the present wording rather than to the improvement which has been suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a classic case of the pan calling the kettle "sooty bottom" when the Minister said that putting in the words "as aforesaid" was ungainly. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
accept that we might usefully leave out those words, but even if they were left in they would compare as a classic piece of streamlined precis with the wording of the original clause. I agree with the Minister that elegance of language is of secondary consideration compared with precise legal meaning, but in a very interesting way the Minister has explained to the Committee why the word "being" is not used in clause 2 although it is used in clause 3, and thereby he exposed one of the graver weaknesses of his own wording. If it is the case that the word "being" means "being used at the time" and therefore that the inspector would have a right of access to the vehicle only when it was carrying passengers along the road, then goodness knows that should be in a most horrible plight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely, the same argument would apply to his own wording in subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) of
	<br><blockquote><p>"is so used to carry passengers at separate fares".</p></blockquote>
By the use of the same sort of tortuous logic it could be argued that the word "is" means "at the present time". Therefore, the operator could say that even if he had had a temporary discontinuation for one week, that vehicle was no longer being used. The word "is" is not the appropriate word. I shall be quite happy if the Minister will give an assurance that if he can find a way around this difficulty he will attempt to use the neater wording. But he cannot argue, on the basis of "being" being interpreted to mean at the actual time that it "is so used", and while attempting to qualify it by a different tense in sub-paragraph (ii), that that is a precise or neat way of doing it. In fact, I think that it will raise considerable difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sub-section (1) with paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) put together is not a clear definition. The Minister admits that it then has to be qualified by sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii). That is the part at which the Bill raises the question of permanent discontinuance. I think that if the Minister wants permanent discontinuance to apply to paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) there is no reason why he should not use that point in those paragraphs and drop sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii). However, we do not want a long argument about legal drafting points. I think that I have shown quite clearly, and I think that the Miister accepts it, although he puts, tongue in cheek, this argument of diffi-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
culty of definition. I shall accept that there may be a difficulty in the use of "being", but if there is it has been in our law for a long time. It has not yet caused any difficulties for the courts. The argument is that in the future it might do so. I can only say that any change of wording might cause difficulties in the future. Until these things get into the courts, we never know what a slick operator can do with a change of wording.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However a change of wording has been introduced by the Minister I think it is subject to the objections which I have raised. He has raised an objection which I should like to take into account. I would like to drop "as aforesaid" anyway and I take his criticism on that point. If we can do without that, so much the better for our amendment. I believe that there is a neater and clearer way and that there is a very serious difficulty with the wording which he has chosen. I do not mind it being long and inelegant if the meaning is perfectly clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"is so used to carry passengers'</p></blockquote>
will not fit with
	<br><blockquote><p>"not so adapted whose use as mentioned in paragraph (a) has been permanently discontinued."</p></blockquote>
They involve the same difficulty of tense as the use of the word "being". However, the use of the word "being" has not raised difficulties in the courts so far. We are dealing with a problem which the Minister argues may be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be happy to try to deal with that if the Minister gave us some assurance that he accepts the major point behind the amendment. In fact, he is in some difficulty in separating paragraph (	<i>a</i>) from (ii) since they are supposed to be read continuously in order to have the meaning which he would like attached to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does he accept that paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) in themselves are not complete definitions, and that paragraph (	<i>a</i>) must be qualified by sub-paragraph (ii) and that paragraph (	<i>b</i>) must be qualified by sub-para (i)? Therefore to give them the meaning which he wants paragraph (	<i>a</i>) and sub-paragraph (ii) have to read together and that cannot be done at the moment because of the problem of tense. By getting rid of "being" he has brought in the difficulty of tense with "is so used". Does he accept that that is a difficulty and will he agree to look at it again to see</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, I shall consider what the right hon. Gentleman said. I did not have my tongue in cheek on the use of the word "being". When the right hon. Gentleman considers it, I think that he will accept that although we are dealing with a fanciful argument which someone might raise, when one talks about the vehicle being used for a particular purpose it would be a very fanciful argument to suggest that that only means when it is moving. If the wording is altered to "is being used" the argument that Parliament is only intending it to apply when it is moving and there are passengers in it is strengthened. I think that that part in the suggested amendments could conceivably change the meaning in an undesirable direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Otherwise, without wishing to make any commitments, I shall certainly consider the rest of the arguments. I concede that the whole point of the sub-section is, as the right hon. Gentleman says, that paragraph (	<i>a</i>) must be qualified by subparagraph (ii) and that paragraph (	<i>b</i>) must be qualified by sub-paragraph (i). In any event it is a rather extraordinary order. However, I think that we both agree that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"permanently discontinued"</p></blockquote>
has to appear. I understand that the Confederation of Passenger Transport agrees on that as well, again in order to remove the possible fanciful doubt. I believe that what we have is clear and that the meaning is right. It is a question of whether it is phrased properly. Obviously that will be looked at and I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we shall look at it seriously. It will be preferable if agreement can be reached on a form of words which successfully combines the various subordinate clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for that assurance.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, given that the argument could be advanced regarding "being", that there is a real difficulty. But there is also a difficulty with "is so used". The Minister does not want, and we do not want "is so used" to mean used at any time. We want it to mean used other than at the time that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
is covered by the qualification in sub-para graph (ii)—the time of permanent discontinuance. We have to find a wording that meets both those objections—to "being" being interpreted as use at a particular time and to "is so used" being interpreted as use at any time. Both sides want to avoid those difficulties and, I hope, to get a neater form of wording. But that is a secondary objective. I take it that we agree that our primary objective is to make the point absolutely clear, and that it means a vehicle used at any time, other than when there has been a permanent discontinuance. That is the commonsense meaning that we are aiming at and we hope also to achieve a more orderly arrangement of the clause.

We come to a serious issue of judgment as to the scope of the public service vehicle definition which involves our relationship with other EEC countries, the way in which manufacturers set about producing vehicles and a whole series of other issues. It is not a question of differences on wording, it concerns an essential difference of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill seeks to take vehicles with eight passenger seats out of the public service vehicle definition, provided that they are not used to carry passengers at separate fares. That is a different approach to the definition to that contained in EEC legislation. I shall come to that later. Under this definition, a vehicle can be used for hire or reward provided separate fares are not charged. It can have eight passenger seats and still not be a public service vehicle. That is a change in our law. I do not claim to have researched the whole of our transport law, I researched back to 1930 when the eight passenger seat vehicle was regarded as a public service vehicle, provided it carried passengers for hire or reward. The change must be justified but it has not been up to now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The judgment of the House does not rest upon considerations of 50 years ago. As recently as 1978, when the House con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
sidered sections 5 and 6 of the Transport Act of that year, it decided that the definition of a community bus, should continue to embrace the idea that eight passenger seats should constitute a public service vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in that case, where there was, I think, a genuine will on the part of both sides of the House to give as much flexibility as possible to transport operations in that area, it was judged by both sides of the House that the vehicle with eight passenger seats, in order to run under the special contract carriage provisions of that Act, should still be subject ot PSV licensing. Here we are making a change in the criteria of public service vehicles that have been tested from time to time and not found wanting—in fact, have been endorsed by the House. Therefore, we must ask the Minister some very serious questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to know whether all British car and bus manufacturers who build in these sizes have been operating in accordance with our own national standards. That is my understanding. I should like to know which car and bus firms the Minister has consulted. In discussion with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, has the Minister found that that poses a serious difficulty? Can the Minister confirm that, if this Bill is enacted, there will be only one factory in this country building non-public service vehicles of eight passenger seats? I believe that there is one multinational factory. Otherwise it will be impossible for a number of British manufacturers to build within the normal legislative standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister has had these discussions—I assume that he has, because he is a responsible man and must realise that there are implications for car and bus manufacturers—have those car and bus manufacturers told him whether they intend to go for that market, whether they want to make eight passenger-seat non-PSV type vehicles and how long it will take them to adapt? I believe that Conservative Members who represent areas where there are people who do this work will realise the relevance of that question. They will know how long it takes to adapt production lines and change models to meet changes in legislative requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That aspect is particularly relevant to the explanation—I grace it with the name "explanation"—in the paragraph of the Minister's notes—relating to clause 2. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

is more an explanation of the difficulty that the clause poses, rather than an explanation of the meaning. If one of the requirements of the EEC legislation is that the EEC public service vehicle regulations will apply only in the case of vehicles for more than eight passengers, then we in this House are required—if we are to do our job properly—to examine the purpose of the EEC legislation, and—incidentally—determine whether it is the same as our purpose in having public service vehicle licensing, which I contend that it is not. Even if EEC legislation had that requirement, this definition would not meet that requirement—at least, that is how it appears to me. So we must consider the matter very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will correct me if my memory is at fault, but I cannot recall the matter being explained by the Minister on Second Reading. Yet, clearly, it is a point of substance, certainly to those who manufacture and to those who operate these vehicles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this clause is a step towards EEC legislation—the Minister was not slow to point out in the consultation document two areas where he felt that this legislation was a move towards harmonisation with the EEC—then why stop at this point? The EEC legislation will contain the same definition as we have here, with an entirely different purpose. Will the EEC want to operate on a much simpler, less sophisticated and less satisfactory basis than we have operated in this country? Does the EEC want to approach the matter in a very simple way, wanting one law for inspection of vehicles which will apply to all vehicles carrying more than eight passengers, irrespective of the qualifications which we have applied in our law? Is it the case that up to now in our law there have been vehicles with more than eight passenger seats that were not public service vehicles in certain forms of use? That is the way in which I read our law. If it means that, to go all the way in complying with an EEC approach such as that we should have to place all vehicles with more than eight passenger seats within the definition of public service vehicles, not just those which operate for hire or reward. Therefore I contend that clause 2(1) falls between the two stools. It meets neither the EEC requirement nor what up to now has been regarded as the
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
British one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we must know before proceeding on this course whether the Minister has had any indication from the EEC about whether it will accept what we have regarded in this country—and, I take it, is still seen by the Minister—as the necessity for the dual test for public service vehicles. The dual test is that they have to be used for hire or reward, and then either for carrying passengers "at separate fares" or adapted to carry a specific number of passengers. There will be a difficulty if the EEC suggests that the only basis on which it will apply public service testing or operator licensing will relate to the number of passenger seats. Within the EEC there must be a number of vehicles running around with more than eight passengers, but which must operate at least under the legislation of the countries in which they are used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Have they had to adapt in any way, or is it a peculiar difficulty for us that arises from our approach? Is the Bill only a stepping stone, and the precursor of one that will be brought forward in a year or two, which will alter the first part of the subsection to exclude the hire and reward check as well? If so, we should know before we make this change and before British manufacturers are asked to adapt to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now wish to raise another matter with the Minister, so that we can better understand the aim of the change. The Minister declared that he intends to be most meticulous in seeing that nothing is done to reduce safety standards in all the changes that he is to introduce. He will find complete support for this side of the Committee in that declaration. Therefore, it seems to us wholly inappropriate that at the very time when the Minister is encouraging a greater sharing of vehicles by other provisions in the Bill, and he is suggesting to people that it is right to share their vehicles with as many others as possible, he is taking out of public service vehicle testing a category of vehicle that must be borderline at best in its operation—that is, one with eight passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a vehicle, which carries at least nine persons—we shall come to the definition of "passenger" later—must be very near the line of whether it is subject to all those tests. Up till now it has been regarded by the British Parliament as having to meet the test of a public service vehicle if it is used for the carrying of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
passengers for hire on reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has taken that out at a time when all sorts of questions are being raised about the best way to operate, when he—not necessarily we—wants to encourage a wider sharing of vehicles. He owes it to the Committee to explain why he takes a view counter to his declared aim that a number of vehicles which could be used to carry eight passengers can be taken out of the test requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises a serious question on the safety of operations. Unless the Minister explains his aim he is placing a question mark over not only the manufacture of our vehicles but the relationship between our legislation and that of the EEC. Therefore, in order that we may have a full and proper debate, I hope the Minister will give the Committee the advantage of his consideration of these questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, the right hon. Gentleman is making heavy weather of what we regard as a fairly uncontroversial and simple measure. Let me immediately correct something that he said. He said that it was not mentioned in the consultation document. It most certainly was mentioned in that document, which we sent out in August 1979. In the document, in relation to small commercial vehicles, we stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The exemption threshold from PSV licensing for vehicles hired as a whole will be raised from seven to eight passenger seats."</p></blockquote>
So there is and has been, consultation. I am open to correction here, but my understanding of the situation is that there has been no adverse response from the manufacturers on this point, so I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman need have any fears there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, what we are talking about here are a few eight-seater cars and a small number of minibuses. Increasing from seven to eight seats the threshold by which a vehicle for hire and reward becomes a public service vehicle will, as the right hon. Gentleman said, bring the United Kingdom into line with EEC thresholds. The difference in thresholds has in some respects been confusing for people with eight-seater minibuses not covered by EEC requirements such as drivers' hours, but within the United Kingdom bus licensing framework. Frankly, I think that bringing that into
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
line is not a particularly controversial thing to do—to go up from seven to eight seats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point goes to the heart of what the right hon. Gentleman said. We may talk of the European dimension, but basically we are here concerned with vehicles for private car sharing. He is right in saying that. It is the point of what we are doing. To that extent, we believe that this is a modest liberalising measure to increase capacity in that area. The Government feel that there should be the freedom to make use of those cars and vehicles for private sharing without legal obstruction and without restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe that there is a very wide potential for car sharing. We believe that it is justified both on grounds of energy saving and on grounds of relieving congestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just returned from the United States where I spent one week talking about transport policy with officials there. I will state briefly what the United States Administration is doing. It believes that the energy saving potential of what it calls ride sharing, car sharing or van sharing is "enormous".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Besides its great potential for conserving energy, ride sharing offers other important benefits. It relieves traffic and parking congestion, reduces air pollution, cuts down on personal transportation expenses, and increases personal mobility."</p></blockquote>
The United States Administration has found that in some cities—Los Angeles, for example,—car pooling has saved 2.3 million gallons of fuel and made many savings in costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that car pooling is a potential which has not yet been fully recognised or even seriously considered in this country. Hitherto we have always taken that to be the view, slightly reluctantly, of the Opposition. The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) will remember that that was part of the intention of the Transport Act 1978. I am sure that he had some part in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other countries are also moving in this direction. Clearly, I know all the differences between the transport situation in the United States and the situation here. But at a recent meeting of the Council of Ministers in Europe it was clear that West Germany was also intending to take the same sort of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically we are saying that car sharing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
has a potential. We believe that it is sensible, purely on the basis of totally undoctrinaire and simple reasoning, to increase the capacity from seven passengers to eight to bring it into line with the rest of Europe and at the same time to act in a modest liberalising way. That is the intent of what we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the right hon. Gentleman is right, that if we take the eight-seater vehicles out of the PSV system they will not be subject to those controls, they will still be subject to MOT testing. There will, therefore, still be safety testing on those vehicles. As it happens, as the right hon. Gentleman fairly said, very few of these vehicles are in existence at present. This might be an opportunity for manufacturers to enter the European market in this limited respect. Frankly, I believe that the change we are making is uncontroversial, and does not have a major effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our genuine policy is to seek to persuade more people to share cars and these small vans. That is important, although the right hon. Gentleman and I might disagree on that. But the Government's view is that this is a sensible way forward, when everyone should be considering the question of energy saving and, particularly in cities such as London, the question of congestion. What we are doing in the Bill is sensible and uncontroversial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To start with the Minister's philosophical point following his visit to the United States, he should bear in mind that, in transport terms, the United States is a society which is most given to squandering its energy resources and is least efficient in its use of energy. Any propositions brought from the United States need to be considered, therefore, in the context that if there is a way of wasting fuel the Americans have perfected it. They use fuel to excess. I understand that also applies to American jet engines, which use more fuel than others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
much attention because they are virtually irrelevant to the situation prevailing in this country. Perhaps the Minister was not here when we discussed what is relevant to this country. That was on a Thursday. The Minister was unable to arrange our Thursday sittings in such a way that he could attend Cabinet meetings and the sittings of this Committee. Clearly, he has not had time to read the record of our fourth sitting. I am not given to quoting myself, but I refer him to column 172 of the Official Report of our sitting on 20 December. I pointed out that the Transport and Road Research Laboratory recently produced a report entitled "Car Sharing and Car Pooling in Great Britain: the recent situation and potential".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That report said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a 10 per cent. increase in car occupancy"</p></blockquote>
—which we would all accept is not a gigantic percentage increase—
	<br><blockquote><p>"can be achieved only if the perceived cost of motoring doubles".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister will tell us that the perceived cost of motoring will indeed double. Only in the face of such massive increases can an increase even of 10 per cent. be achieved. Therefore, any savings from car sharing will not be very substantial. It is also possible that there may be actual energy losses from car sharing. A stage could be reached when people opted to share cars and stopped using public transport, which uses less energy than cars. This wondrous car sharing is not necessarily always an absolute gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also other factors that we need to examine. Had we not had a disquisition on the philosophy of car sharing and the wonders of the United States' promotion of car sharing, I should not have launched into the subject at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point at issue is whether the bottom limit of public service vehicle licensing should be moved up. It is ridiculous for the Minister to justify the fact that certain vehicles will be removed from PSV safety licensing on the grounds that MOT testing will still apply. If we followed that argument to its logical conclusion we should abolish the vehicle testing side of PSV licensing altogether, and make do with MOT tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not do so because we have always recognised that MOT testing is not adequate for public service vehicles. The suggestion is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
There is another matter to be examined, although we do not have a great deal of experience of it. To wander around either in a vehicle or as a pedestrian is to see that, apart from the clapped-out banger, the most clapped-out vehicles on the roads are a vast series of peculiar, decrepit-looking minibuses. They are all over the streets of London, and look very duff outfits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the last few years there have been relaxations through the Minibus Act 1977, which relaxed the law on public service vehicles in relation only to what should be highly responsible bodies to charitable organisations or statutory bodies, which should have a considerable sense of responsibility for the passengers in vehicles connected with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had no time at all to analyse accident statistics following that relaxation of public service vehicle licensing for respectable bodies running minibuses. There is every possibility that as the bottom limit is pushed further up, and as everyone, apart from the Minister, recognises that MOT testing is unsatisfactory when compared with PSV licensing safety aspects, the odds are that there will be an increase in accidents. If the vehicles are to be larger, the consequences of individual accidents will become worse. In my view, this is a leap in the dark, albeit only a small leap. No one in this country is capable of a long leap at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other aspect to which my right hon. Friend referred is the question of who will be able to provide, manufacture or supply to potential purchasers the new vehicles, which are one seat larger. In Committee generally speaking, we do not abuse one another, but it is rather odd to hear a Minister say that, if we increase the limit, our manufacturers will have the opportunity to operate in the EEC market. The fact is that our manufacturers have not operated in the EEC market up to now. Only one manufacturer in this country produces vehicles of that size. Moreover, quite a number of EEC manufacturers produce vehicles of that size. In other words, the most likely source of supply for those vehicles will be countries other than our country, probably our so-called partners in the European Economic Community. By casual adjustment of the limit we shall do further damage to British manufacturing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no good Conservative Members
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
wincing. We are not saying that the motor manufacturing industry will be brought to its knees—or even to its ankles—because it is already on its knees. We are saying that this one casual measure being popped through this morning will be yet another minor" damage to British manufacturing industry. Certainly, hon. Members from the Midlands, where many people rely for their bread and butter on manufacturing vehicles, should bear this in mind—indeed, hon. Members from Merseyside, too, a number of whom are members of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we must consider this matter carefully. There is no evidence that the Minister has considered either the safety consequences of this change or the consequences to British manufacturing industry. All we have had is the usual statement, and even that statement has not been substantiated by any evidence from this country. The evidence from this country—from an offshoot of the Minister's own Department—suggests that all the claims for the energy-saving aspect of car sharing are grossly exaggerated, and comparisons with energy squandering societies abroad are quite irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Cowans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister, because I expected a revelation of some divine thought that we would alter transport by stepping the number of seats from seven to eight. But we did not get that. It is not the increase from seven to eight that matters. When one steps up from seven to eight one successfully excludes those with seven-seater cars from all the protections that were originally provided. Surely, the reason for PSV licensing was the protection of the passengers. By moving up, we are saying to those people unlucky enough to travel in a seven-seater car "You will get less protection than a person who travels in an eight-seater car".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we doing the public a service? I suggest that we are not—certainly not for those people unlucky enough to travel in a seven-seater car—because up until now they have been protected, and now they will not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hear a great argument about energy, but those who propound this argument take it only as far as it suits their purposes. They say that by providing a seat for one more passenger less petrol will be used overall and there will be an energy saving. If that argument were car-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
ried to its logical conclusion, surely if a bus was filled with 34 people, which took eight cars off the road, that, too, would provide a big energy saving. Therefore, those who propound this argument on energy stop when it suits their purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This movement from seven to eight will allow people who previously needed a PSV licence to carry seven people in a car to give those seven people less protection. I have listened to the Minister and I have read his notes and the gist of his case is to bring us into line with the EEC, and not for any other logical argument. If that is the reason then we should be told so. That is the only reason. Had the EEC said that the figure should be 10, presumably the clause would have said 10—not on any logical argument and with no real concern for the number of vehicles which will now have to undergo much more rigorous tests than the MOT. We are being asked to throw away a large amount of our passenger protection for only negligible gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a vehicle manufacturer—I did not hear the Minister answer this point satisfactorily—it must appear logical that if the EEC has this present legislation the other EEC countries' manufacturers are geared to that and ours are not. This will surely give the edge to foreign manufacturers rather than our own. Even if tomorrow morning a manufacturer had to set up a new line for an eight seater car it would take time to get production started. Presumably, such a line already exists overseas. So we are handing something on a plate to our foreign competitors, and for the gain of one seat. Other than that we must come into line with the EEC, I see no gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many claims have been made for car sharing, but we are now entering into a competition with people already operating this business, and for what reason? We are taking out testing to allow car sharing, yet the stringent tests that apply to taxis are still to apply, yet Conservative Members have the sheer audacity to talk about fair competition and wider choice. It seems to me that there is a wider choice for some people but certainly not for those who at present have to operate a car business. The situation will be much worse. Lifting the figure to eight seats will create all sorts of complications. One comes on to hire fleets and to taxis. The clause removes a safety that the public has at present without replacing it with anything dramatic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern for the passenger is the factor behind the public service vehicle licence. Equally, that concern is why taxis and other vehicles have to go through such stringent tests. The clause means that all the vehicles that previously had to have stringent tests are now excluded. To what end and for what gain? For one seat. Surely that is ludicrous. The law has worked quite adequately on the basis of seven seats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment and to leave the figure as it is. Otherwise, he will do the public at large a disservice, he will hamper the taxi and hire car trade which is subject to stringent tests and he will take out of those stringent tests vehicles which carry passengers for hire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Penhaligon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to my views on car-sharing. I should like to make it clear exactly where I stand. I have always been a staunch advocate of car-sharing in rural areas where transport has reached the point where that is the last, desperate hope. Knowing rural areas rather better than urban ones, I advocate it very strongly from that point of view. There are in my constituency—and certainly in that of the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale)—villages and hamlets which have had no public transport for the past decade and, taking a realistic view on subsidies, have no hope of any in the near future. Even if the Bill removed all the licences referred to by the Minister as hindering transport in rural areas, there would still be no public transport in those areas because it is neither viable or probable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would actually go much further than the Bill does. I should like to see a system whereby people registered, where there were recognised pick-up points and a recognised system of charging for journeys back and forth to the hamlets. I have been strongly of that opinion for a long time, and I maintain that view. As one relatively neutral on the urban problem, I rather doubt whether the argument is as good for journeys in and out of London, Liverpool or Birmingham, although the Minister is clearly expecting people to go out and buy seven and eight-seater cars so that they can pick up their neighbours when they go to work in the morning and bring them to the City office. I can see the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
advantage for people in a particular street, but I am not sure that it would be in their long-term interests because of the effect that it would have in reducing the use of the national public transport system. However, I have no very strong view on this, so, as we have not yet reached that point in the argument I will leave it until later. Nevertheless, I certainly have some doubts on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the MoT test, I must say that I get sick and tired of our pontificating about the safety aspect of the MoT test. The reduction in accidents since the introduction of the test has been pathetically small. So long as we are prepared, without batting an eyelid, to let 39 per cent. of drivers, drunk, kill themselves in accidents, I do not know why we bother with any road safety legislation. We are afraid to pick up that particular hot potato because we think that we may lose votes by so doing. As one who greatly increased his majority in the last election, I am now prepared to lose a few more votes than I risked losing before by saying this. It is nonsense to think that one system or the other has any enormous contribution to make. A marginal contribution, yes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Marginal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Penhaligon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is kind of emotional reaction one gets. Perhaps I may explain to the hon. Member. I am quite close to this issue. My brother would be heartbroken if the MoT test were stopped, because it is the backbone of his garage business. We have often talked about this, and he makes the same kind of defence whenever I attack the ludicrous charade of the MoT test. He says, "But David, what if they have no brakes?" I reply, "John, name me three of your customers who are likely to drive a car regularly without any brakes." He has yet to produce two, although he has produced one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that this is being presented as a serious argument. I recall many Members of Parliament being concerned about brakes on coaches. I do not suppose it is proposed that people would want to use coaches without brakes, but there is a correlation between the degree of maintenance of a vehicle and the regularity of checks which is important in the implementation of safety legislation. The hon. Gentleman is surely
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
not saying that it is a mere emotional reaction to talk about brakes. The MoT tests may well be less adequate than one would like, but that is no argument for doing away with a measure which has very readily increased safety standards on vehicles. Indeed, most Members of Parliament tend to ask for higher safety standards, particularly for coaches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Penhaligon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not doing away with it. He has changed the starting level from seven-to eight-passenger vehicles. All I am arguing is that the MOT in itself does not make an enormous contribution to safety, certainly not approaching that which a really strong attack on drinking and driving could make. It is a fact that 39 per cent, of the drivers killed in motor accidents last year were drunk at the time. We should not leave that out of our calculations when we are talking about whether there is a three months' or six months' check.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that there is a difference in car sharing between the really rural area and the urban area. I believe that the arguments for it in rural areas, as the transport of last resort, are absolutely overwhelming. Nothing else is likely to be provided. However, I have grave doubts whether such a system should play a major part in moving people in and out of big cities, although I am open to persuasion on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Weetch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate on amendment No. 19, which at first sight seems to be a matter of increasing the number from seven to eight, has evolved into an argument of principle concerning a number of matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I appreciate that the Minister is trying to take a flexible approach to transport problems. My view is that that sort of approach is needed in many matters. My constituency of Ipswich is in a largely rural area of Suffolk. I agree that the transport problems in some rural districts are desperate. There can be no argument about that. The position has deteriorated over a long period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the subjects in the back of my mind is that concerned with whether there should be a licensing system. On balance, I believe that there should not be. I have already said that I think there are more fundamental factors in operation than licensing in both rural and urban areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A London taxi driver once told me that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
all politicians lived in a cocoon. He invited me to look out of the taxi window—it was during the rush hour—and to try to convince him that people were worried about any sort of energy crisis. He asked me to look at all the cars that were choking the London streets, each of which had only one person in it. When I thought about the matter, I saw that he had a point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have argued about the safety implications of the amendment. Often the MOT test is not worth a light. It is not guaranteed for 20 minutes after one has left the garage. If one points to the MOT test as a defence of the safety aspect of vehicles and states that things must be better than before it went into the garage, I doubt whether that is true in certain instances. In some garages, if a vehicle needs an MOT test it will be jacked up and examined in a most perfunctory way while one waits. Often one is invited to have a cup of tea and to look through the glass plate while the test is conducted. I realise that not everything can be checked, but some of the MOT testing about which I have learnt leaves a good deal to be desired. The other thing wrong is that while the MOT test might mean that one pays a lot for repairs, whether one pays for what should be taken care of is another matter. One of the defects of the MOT legislation is that those who stand to profit from the repairs judge the mechanical efficiency of the car. In many ways, the matter is a positive disgrace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that when the Minister makes this sort of approach to transport problems he is trying to be more flexible and to provide more appropriate forms of transport for the consumer—in the rural areas, any form at all. However, it seems a small step for such a large subject. I wonder whether it will be like the dog that did not bark in the night. Will the measure do very much?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seeks to strike out towards something substantial, but I do not believe that there is much in the provision. As he said, it is a very modest change. If the Minister is interested in more radical changes, I wonder whether this is worth bothering with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another point to be considered. Has the Minister sorted out the implications of the change for British manufacturing industry? When we discussed vehicle excise duty in the House—for all sorts of reasons I am a supporter of doing away with excise duty and increasing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
price of petrol—the Minister, who was then on the Opposition side of the House, put up a great deal of resistance to the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter that was brought up then—if not by the Minister, by one of his right hon. or hon. Friends—was the effect on British manufacturing industry, which could be substantial. The then Opposition had taken that point fully into consideration. Has the Minister taken manufacturing considerations on board this time?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What he said particularly interested me and I took it down. He said that it was a step towards car sharing, in which he believed. He went on to state that car sharing in Britain had a potential. Debate has centred around the sharing of vehicles, and one or two items in the Minister's argument should be scrutinised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, in principle I am in favour of car sharing. That is because I see some of the transport problems in rural areas which could be solved by wider car sharing. With increasing costs of fuel—and I see that the price of petrol is again going up— problems are now very serious in rural areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In East Anglia as a whole, car ownership is the highest in Britain. People are forced to own cars to get to work because public transport has deteriorated so badly. They must make an investment in many cases for something that they do not want and cannot afford. I can foresee that shared vehicles will enable people to lower their transport costs, particularly in rural areas. Let me widen that and add that I am not in any doctrinaire way defending the 	<i>status quo.</i> Goodness knows, people in Suffolk have had a bad deal from the present transport system. Any constructive changes are to be welcomed. Transport in the long run is a practical matter of shifting goods and people. In the end it should be judged on practical considerations. I am for change provided it does not destroy established services.

If a man wishes to share his vehicle, another person in a second vehicle will give up that vehicle in order to have a ride with the man in the first vehicle, thereby one vehicle is saved. That is the first proposition. Sometimes that is true and sometimes it is not. One must remember that the car in the rural area is the most flexible form of transport there is. One goes from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
door to door, one can load things into it in the garage, and so on. Encouraging the man in the second car to travel with another deprives him of his flexible form of transport. But the person who is carried by bus does not have a flexible form of transport. He runs to a timetable. One is more likely to attract someone from an inflexible form of transport into one's car, provided one can get that information out, than from another form of transport with the same flexibility as one's own. Therefore, in certain circumstances one is likely to attract passengers from the public transport system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other difficulties in sharing vehicles. In 1976—the Minister no doubt knows this—there was an experiment in car sharing in the county of Suffolk by the Consumers Association. I am not sure of the legality of the experiment, but I am sure it must have been legal because the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Griffiths) and myself helped to promote it. Broadly speaking, Ipswich was chosen because it was geographically simple to understand. Further, our local radio station was community-minded and willing to disseminate the maximum information about car sharing. Finance was also provided to put somebody into an office behind a telephone to receive calls. Everything that could possibly be done in the way of information and personnel was provided for the experiment. The net result was that the experiment in car sharing was a total failure. Not only that, it was a complete and abject failure in an area where it was thought that the optimum conditions prevailed for this sort of initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experiment failed for some very obvious reasons. First, anyone accustomed to travelling on his or her own to work does not readily give up that flexibility to pick up somebody else, when it might be necessary to rearrange one's own schedule throughout the day to do so. That was fundamental. Secondly, it was difficult to co-ordinate journeys if one had to make a detour to pick up the passenger. Many people thought it not worth while to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In debating this amendment, and all the issues that centre around it, although we appear to be arguing these matters on clear-cut simple lines, the position on the ground is not simple, but enormously complex.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to intervene quickly, as we shall come to an amendment later that is related to this one and which requires the definition of "passengers". Would the driver be considered a passenger? I assume that nine people would be allowed to be in a car that is not covered by the provisions for a public service vehicle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to be the logical interpretation of the Bill. Since the matter is also relevant to the next amendment, it would save time if the Minister in addressing himself to this amendment gave a definition of what constitutes a passenger and the total number of people he envisages sharing a car.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make clear to the Minister that I did not say that there was no reference to the matter in the consultative document, but that I could not recall it. I apologise for the weakness of my memory on the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reply given to the Committee on the question of manufacturers shows how little discussion there has been. I take it that the Minister means that he has not discussed the matter either with individual manufacturers or the SMMT, that they have not come to him about it and that he has waited for them to take the initiative or make objections, neither of which has yet come about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the way in which matters have proceeded, we may be in for some unpleasant surprises in other parts of the Bill. We have discovered, in discussing the matter outside the House, that people have not appreciated from the consultative document the number of pitfalls in the legislation. However, that is a matter of contention. What should be a matter of fact, and something on which the Minister should be able to speak with authority, is the question that I put and which he has not answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is passed in this form will we have brought our legislation into line with the proposed EEC legislation in the matter? Will we need to go one further step forward and will the reason for that be that the EEC intends to have regulations that will apply to all vehicles running on its roads which are adapted to carry more than eight passengers? If so, we shall have to make a much more radical appraisal and alteration of our law than anything that the Minister is contemplating in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
In practice, there are three tests in the legislation that apply to determine whether a vehicle is a public service vehicle. The first and most obvious is whether it is run for hire and reward. Separate fares must be charged and provision made for eight or more passengers. If I am justified in my suspicions that the measure does not go the whole way to meeting the EEC position, the Minister must give the Committee some indication of his thinking and whether he intends to bring in further legislation to put us in line with the EEC. It is not good enough for us to proceed with detailed legislation based on presumptions about the significance of hire and reward and whether separate fares are to be charged, if it is all to be set aside in the very near future in the interest of the EEC approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question whether the eight-seat minibus is a public service vehicle. With the greatest respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans), the difficulties that he described—while real and serious—are only part of the problem. The operator's difficulty will not only be that he must face competition on the basis of that number of seats, he will also have to compete with someone who does not charge separate fares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be two operators of eight-seat minibuses, one of whom charges separate fares and has to put his bus through the public service vehicle test and the other who chooses instead to operate on routes with fixed fares and with only an MOT certificate for his vehicle. I want to know the justification for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely we do not believe that a person who pays a separate fare does so for a better standard of vehicle test than one who pays a fixed fare. However, that seems to be the only logical basis on which one can defend that sort of proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that it helps with car sharing. It would certainly do that if one viewed it as being an adjunct to the provisions of subsection (3), because it would allow those vehicles with up to eight passengers to go at the rates prescribed by the Minister. The only logical way in which the Minister's words can be interpreted is that they will not be regarded as separate rates, but excluded by the provisions of subsection (3). Somebody with an eight-seater minibus, having arranged in advanced to pick up people at various points, could charge them the separate
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
fares which accord with the scales laid down by the Minister for a vehicle with eight passenger seats, and yet be operating perfectly legally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, will the Minister say "only fixed fares", and make complete nonsense of his car sharing provisions. Of course he cannot do that. The only intelligent way in which he can proceed is to allow people to be picked up at various points, to charge in accordance with the distance that the passenger is carried—having arranged it in advance—and to operate in a way that would be completely at variance with what is a basic test of the law in other matters, irrespective of whether a separate fare rate is charged. In other words, both the Minister's aim in car sharing and the EEC law may be in conflict with what is being laid down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The very interesting subject has been raised of how the matter is relevant to rural and urban areas, and to the British scene as opposed to that in the United States. It cannot be said to be of help to rural operators as opposed to urban operators. If someone in a rural area with a 20 mile journey to work could make an arrangement under the car sharing provision to pick someone up 10 miles from his destination and carry him in the rest of the way that would be perfectly reasonable, if it suited them both. However, if he was taking one person for the full 20 miles and someone else for only 10 miles that could be sensibly done only on the basis of charging a separate rate. The person who wants to do that as a minibus operator in a rural area—I should have thought that the Minister would want to encourage that—is disadvantaged by the arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he chooses to charge separate fares in his minibus operation, by definition he must become a public service vehicle operator. However, if he wishes to operate in a town with a set charge, or in a big conurbation such as Birmingham, Strath-clyde or Tyneside—if he wants to run his eight-seater minibus between North Shields and Newcastle, for example, at a fixed fare—there is nothing to stop him. He can do that under this provision. He does not have to be a public service vehicle operator to operate in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the nonsense which the definition makes. We are owed a far more satisfactory explanation by the Minister of the proposition's intention. Did he intend to create that sort of nonsense in the run-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
ning of bus services? Equally fundamental is the point about what furhter legislation he will have to bring in to put our law in respect of public service vehicles in line with EEC law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting and good debate and I shall try to respond to as many points as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, my reply to the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cowans) is that there is obviously a balance between conventional public transport on one side and different measures on the other. It does not seem to me that we should exclude matters such as car sharing from our transport policy. In our policy we are seeking to add to the total transport provision in this country. I should have thought that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would support that concept. Indeed, the hon. Members for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) and for Ipswich (Mr. Weetch) approved and supported the concept of car sharing in rural areas, as I believe do many of my hon. Friends. I believe that there is a contribution to be made here, which is why we seek to move in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must remind Labour Members who are taking a hostile view of the whole concept that it was the Transport Act 1978 introduced by their Administration which went down this car-sharing road. If they believed that, I cannot see the logic of the position that the last Government took in the 1978 Transport Act. As the hon. Member for Ipswich said, a car gives a flexibility which in many cases is of enormous use and value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson), as I understood his remarks, said, first, that he believed that this was a "leap in the dark". An increase fom seven to eight is a fairly limited leap in the dark. I do not believe that anyone can accurately and fairly categorise it in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again I point out to the hon. Gentleman that the last Administration helped my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Hunt) when he made changes in the laws governing private minibuses in the charity community associations. The change there was not from seven to eight but from 7 to 16. Not only did the last Government help in that respect; they
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
claimed it in their transport policy as one of the achievements of the last Labour Administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Gentleman fairly argue that that change supports his case, when that piece of legislation for community buses was designed to make the community bus subject to a form of public service vehicle licence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that it is subject to a very modified form of public transport licensing. It is basically only the check of the MoT. The vehicle itself has to meet certain regulations, but the major check on its annual running is the MoT test, about which hon. Gentlemen have been talking, if I may say so, with some exaggeration. I do not believe that anyone looking at this provision can categorise it as a leap in the dark or a dramatic step of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we well understand the point—my hon. Friend made it—that seven to eight did not seem necessarily to be a major leap in the dark. But I wonder what the Minister's views would be if hackney taxicabs, under the hackney regulations, were to go from four seats to five. Presumably there would be sufficient reasons—I wonder what he has in mind—to refuse giving them that substantial change. Why do we limit it to four?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hackney carriages do not come under my responsibility, but I am perfectly prepared to look at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of energy saving, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South said that he thought—as I understand his argument—that we might, if we were lucky, reach that point, it will make a real contribution to the problem of coming into some of our major cities. At the moment, each day during the peak period 130,000 vehicles come into London. Those 130,000 vehicles carry about 170,000 people. If we can get only a limited joining up and car sharing, a real contribution would be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen also asked about the implications for car and bus manufacturers. We issued a consultation document in August in which all this was set out. I have now checked. We have had no representations from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in this respect. Nor
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
have we had any representations from the motor industry. I repeat, therefore, that the Opposition are creating difficulties which are not actually seen by the industry itself. If the Opposition believes that our motor industry, which I support, does not have the capability to adapt in this small way, they have a lack of confidence in the motor industry in this country which I do not share.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Prescott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making a facetious point. There have been a number of reports which have suggested that the British motor car industry for one reason or another—we have chosen British Leyland in this context—has not looked ahead at the sort of changes that are needed. I give a specific example. The Minister has visited the south Yorkshire transportation system and noticed that the company there was the only one operating a flexi-bus. The south Yorkshire people have desperately been trying to get British Leyland to produce a flexi-bus. British Leyland produced one that is not much use, and is not particularly interested in the market. It was necessary, therefore, to talk to the Germans about a Mercedes alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fowler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should keep a sense of perspective about this. There is all the difference in the world between the flexi-bus and the addition of one seat. The whole purpose of the consultation document was to take the advice of the motor industry. I have confidence that this is a point which the SMMT has looked at, but we have had no representations from the SMMT. It is a matter of judgment. If the hon. Gentleman wants to back his own judgment against that of the SMMT, that is up to him. The hon. Gentleman's views are not shared by the Government. The reasons</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
	<p>and the arguments that the hon. Gentleman puts forward are valid.</p>
	<p>As regards the right hon. Gentleman's point concerning EEC regulations, clearly this brings the breaking point, the change from seven to eight, into line with the EEC. But it does not—the right hon. Gentleman is right about this—bring everything into line. Nor do I believe that it should. The purpose of different instruments varies. But in this limited respect let us avoid unnecessary divergences. I do not believe that we have to seek to harmonise the whole area at this stage. As the right hon. Gentleman will know, the EEC roadworthiness directive covers all passenger vehicles over eight seats, not just PSVs. All passenger vehicles inside the EEC will have to pass that roadworthiness test. But the provisions of the Bill apply only to vehicles with over eight passenger seats used for hire and reward. The roadworthiness directive will be implemented in due course, but not until 1983. The Bill will not require amendment when that is done.</p>
	<p>I must return to the point I made earlier. We are talking about a few eight-seater cars and a very small number of small minibuses. If these vehicles are used commercially for hire they fall within the taxi and hire car legislation. If they are used commercially at separate fares they will remain PSVs. Therefore, we are referring only to vehicles for private car sharing. We believe in maximum freedom in this respect, that it is a perfectly reasonable step to take, and that it has relevance both to the rural and the city areas. I ask the Committee to reject the amendment tabled by the Opposition.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 11.</p>
	<p>I assume that we are referring to vehicles of eight passengers plus one, which means nine people in a vehicle. The Minister was being somewhat unfair and did not answer the point, although we can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1979-1980V011P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
perhaps make inquiries before the next sitting of the Committee.</p>
	<p>This amendment also seeks to introduce another figure. These figures involve making a judgment. In the schedules, and throughout the Bill, in defining whether a vehicle shall be considered a public service vehicle, it states whether that vehicle should carry more or less than a certain number. As the Minister rightly pointed out, this Bill increases the figure by one. Indeed, Labour legislation increased it from four to seven under certain circumstances. This gives us the opportunity to make clear to the Minister that Labour Ministers have attempted to bring in car sharing provisions. The car sharing provision was largely aimed at the problem of the rural areas. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Pen-
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
haligon) that the Bill is almost a sort of last desperate effort to provide transportation.</p>
	<p>I took the opportunity this weekend in travelling from Newcastle to talk to the Darlington authorities, the United Bus Company, and to discuss the various trial areas. We shall come later in the Bill to the trial areas. I took the opportunity to travel on some of the rural bus services in North Yorkshire which I am sure are very similar to the areas—</p>
