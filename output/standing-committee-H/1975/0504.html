	<p>	<i>Further amendment proposed [29th April]</i> No. 19, in page 3, line 27, after "district", insert "or county".—	<i>[Mr. Raison].</i></p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joseph Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our last sitting, the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) said that when county councils were involved it should be mandatory for them to be part of the consultative process and that they should be able to initiate consultations. I do not believe we can put into the Bill a clause to suit every contingency. In the metropolitan areas formed two years ago as a result of the last local government reorganisation the responsibility for housing was correctly left with district authorities. There has been constant friction between councils and district councils in metropolitan areas over who does what in relation to certain duties. The Bill will have to be very specific on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I said that new towns in the old Lancashire area would be affected. The area of friction, if county councils had a mandatory right of consultation, could be even larger. For instance, it might cover the whole of the North-West, where there are at least two new town areas which would be controlled by a district authority which is a housing authority. If, without a great deal of thought, we include county councils in the consultative process, it will be another issue which could divide county and district authorities in local government, and there are far too many things already dividing them to the disadvantage of the people they represent. I know from my own experience that this has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
People shudder when there is talk of another reform of local government which must be made to work, but the sooner we grasp the nettle and make unitary authorities a totality, the sooner local government will function properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be biter resentment in some metropolitan districts, many of which have large housing authorities, if county councils were to initiate consultations. The situation in some regions might be different. County authorities may have had an historic role in these matters, and it might be acceptable for them to be included in the consultative process. However, giving them that right in metropolitan areas is a recipe for more friction, which can do no good to the people involved in the very things this Bill is supposed to be about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Guy Barnett)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate because it has enabled us to consider whether county councils should be involved in consultations about the transfer of assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) pointed out the confusion in functions which sometimes exists between county and district councils as a result of the reorganisation of local government. He was right when he said it would not be proper for county councils to be able to initiate consultations in what is a matter of complete concern to district councils. I am sure that, on reflection, the Opposition will agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) and Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) made powerful cases on the ground that county councils were responsible for education and roads and were, therefore, inevitably involved in new towns. However, we are talking about the transfer of virtually complete estates or towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with both hon. Members on the importance of ensuring, as far as possible, close consultation and agreement between county and, district councils where there is a split of responsibility between, say, housing and education—in the past there have been too many occasions when housing estates have been built and the local schools have not been big enough—but I do not think we need to regard the county council's rôle in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
consultation quite as highly as the Opposition have made out. We are talking about the transfer of completed estates where, presumably, schools are in operation and roads have been completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the importance of involving county councils in consultation at every stage at which their interests are involved. It would be our intention to ensure, in any direction, that county councils' involvement in consultation would be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to accept that our amendment may give greater power to county councils than is justified, but before this useful debate ends could the Minister say whether he is prepared to consider the possibility of providing a formal right for county councils to be consulted? Would he be prepared to amend the Bill to ensure that county councils' views are sought during the preparation of a scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The county is the principal planning authority and has a right to be involved in matters which involve substantial chunks of housing. As the Minister said, we are not talking about penny packets but, in some cases, substantial areas of housing which are an inherent part of the planning set-up of the county. Though county councils should not necessarily have a right to initiate consultations or a right of veto, they should have a right to be consulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been considered that the interests of county councils can be protected through administrative guidance, but I am prepared to look at the matter to see whether there is some way in which county councils' interests can be protected and to see whether we can write in a guarantee of consultation. Important points have been made in the debate. I hope the Opposition will be prepared to accept the assurance I have just given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of that assurance, for which I am grateful, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That Clause 2 stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for missing the start of the Under-Secretary's
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
remarks on the previous amendment. We are grateful for the assurance that there will be consultations on this clause with the county councils whose interests, financial and planning, are vitally concerned. In view of the Under-Secretary's recognition of the importance of county councils in respect of new towns, there is nothing more I need to say. We have no objection to the inclusion of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>PREPARATION AND CONTENTS OF TRANSFER SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 23, in page 4, line 5, leave out from first 'land' to end of line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already been over this ground, and I now seek reassurance from the Minister that we are concerned only with infill land and not the wider aspect, which worried some people who made representations to us, of land on the edge of an estate which might be white land. They were worried that this might be included. I seek an assurance that we are considering the sort of land we considered in Clause 1, just infill land or land set aside for predetermined purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can give the hon. Member the assurance he seeks. The words which the amendment would leave out are designed to ensure that when a transfer scheme is carried out it is done in such a way as to ensure that proper estate management is possible both for the transferred area and the land still remaining in the hands of the new town corporation. The words which the Opposition seek to delete are designed simply to ensure that proper estate management can continue to take place after a transfer scheme has been effected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the clarification that we are simply concerned with estate management. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 24, in page 4, line 6, leave out from "shall" to end of line 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we are to discuss Amendment No. 27, in page 4, line 22, leave out from "which" to "should" in line 23.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (1) gives the Secretary of State power to make directions to corporations and councils to submit a scheme for transfer. Subsection (3) deals with the management arrangements by which properties are actually transferred. This seems reasonable enough, and the point of the amendment is to elicit from the Minister a little information about the meaning of the words we propose to leave out. I am not clear why they are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 27 is a probing amendment to delete the words
	<br><blockquote><p>'"in the opinion of the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
By definition, directions must represent the opinion of the Secretary of State. What is the direction of this implementation, in the opinion of the Secretary of State? Do these words serve any meaning? They seem to me to be otiose, but I would like to hear from the Minister why they are there and what is their purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best thing I can do is to explain what the amendment would have the effect of doing. It would make it obligatory for every direction to make a transfer scheme issued by the Secretary of State under subsection (1) of the clause to require the parties to include in the scheme management arrangements for dwellings not being transferred and for any other land not being transferred which it is expedient should be managed with such dwellings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, subsection (3) gives the Secretary of State power to omit such a requirement if he considers that a management scheme would be inappropriate—for example, where there is one comprehensive transfer of all housing assets, or, exceptionally, in the case of a partial transfer—perhaps in the case of Central Lancashire New Town—where the local authority may not immediately be able to shoulder the additional burden of managing further large numbers of houses. Management arrangements will
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
be needed in the vast majority of transfer schemes in order that the rents of new houses can continue to be cushioned by those of the older transferred houses, but the Secretary of State should have a discretion to enable management arrangements to be dispensed with in exceptional instances. That is the purpose of these words. The amendment would tie down the Secretary of State, and not make it possible for certain assets not to be transferred or managed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not really clear what these circumstances are. Is the Minister saying that sometimes the managerial job would be too great for a local authority? Is that what the Minister just said, and that one has to safeguard against the possibility that local authorities would not be able to cope with what they are landed with?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could be the case, yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if the Minister would refer to the second amendment. No. 27.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, in effect, was the one I was referring to in that reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the first one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to support my hon. Friend. It seems to me that Amendment 24 is speaking specifically to the situation where the two bodies, the corporation and the council, have come together to a decision and agreement. The clause is now saying that the Secretary of State has provision to overrule them. I would have thought that the basic principle to which both sides are trying to work is that we should leave it to local democracy to decide what it wants to do. When it has reached an agreement the last thing it wants is somebody else to put his finger in the pie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to understand why exception should be taken to the Secretary of State's passing an opinion on the suitability for transfer of particular dwellings, on numbers or classes of dwellings for transfer in the scheme for a particular new town, since in specifying them in his direction at all, as to be excepted from transfer to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
district council, he is indicating that he has formed his own opinion as to whether such transfer is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this amendment were accepted it would seem to follow that the Bill would somehow have to provide some method by which an objective assessment of what should or should not be transferred to a third person should be made. What should or should not be so transferred is in any case a matter for the Secretary of State to decide, since it is he who, under the New Towns Act 1965 and through administrative guidance issued by the Department, exercises control over a new town corporation's power to dispose of its assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that explains the situation to hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point was that it seemed that the words were superfluous. The word "directions" seems to me to imply that this represents the view of the Secretary of State anyway. We do not keep having the words "in the opinion of the Secretary of State" throughout the Bill. I am prepared to accept that they serve merely to reinforce what is implicit in the Bill at the moment, and I do not wish to press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 48, in page 4, line 12, leave out 'of any' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(	<i>a</i>) subject to subsection (3A) below, of all those'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we will also take Amendments Nos. 50 and 52.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are to enable the parties to a scheme, by agreement, to exclude some dwelling from both transfer and management arangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment has been put down because it may be that there are certain assets which do not fall within a sensible transfer or management arrangement. Perhaps the best plan would be for me to give an example of such a dwelling. For instance, there might be a small terrace of a few industrial houses. There might be a caretaker's house or something of that kind, or it could be that a small terrace of houses might be due for demolition after
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
the transfer of assets had taken place. It would, clearly, not be sensible to insist on the transfer or management of all the assets, particularly in so far as exceptional cases of this kind are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For this reason I am moving this series of amendments to make it possible to exclude small exceptional assets of this kind from a management or transfer scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 25, in page 4, line 13, leave out 'or any adjoining district'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday 27th April there was, on the question of adjoining districts, some discussion during which the right hon. Gentleman was kind enough to give us his views and also to stress his commitment to the agreement necessary between all parties, which agreement would be needed to ensure the success of the measures that the Committee is considering. We would wish to support him in that. I do not wish to go over that ground again in detail. We wish to emphasise at this point that there will be agreement needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this amendment is also to probe a little more exactly what we are discussing in this clause. I have chosen to hang that probe on the words "any adjoining district". What we are discussing here are directions which shall be made unless the Secretary of State says it is not appropriate to enter into management arrangements, and management arrangements to be included in a scheme, that is to say, arrangements for the management by the council of any dwellings within its district or adjoining district which it is not proposed to transfer by the scheme, but in which the corporation has an interest for the time being. As far as I understand the meaning and intention it is that some buildings are not to be transferred under the scheme that is to be made, but on the other hand arrangements are to be made for their management by the council to which they are not being transferred, even though they are in the area of another district council. All of us are aware of the difficulties that have arisen. It is not just confined to Crawley New Town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would remind the right hon. Gentleman about these crossings of boundaries,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
and dwellings being in adjacent districts. It is not clear to us that the management of dwellings in an adjoining district should be transferred to another council. I can see there will be difficulties. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman, when he comes to help us with our understanding of this will, for example, indicate who will collect the rates on these buildings. Will there not be real difficulties if there are two sets of collectors coming round with two lots of books? I do not wish to exaggerate the problem, but there is a real practical difficulty. I think we deserve some indication from the right hon. Gentleman of not only what the intention of this paragraph is but how he thinks practical arrangements will be made to cater for the difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Planning and Local Government (Mr. John Silkin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think for the sake of good order and committee discipline it would be better if I, instead of my hon. Friend, were to deal with this amendment since I dealt with the first amendment, moved by the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris), on this subject and this is intended to be a kind of balancing amendment to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not quite achieve that, because whereas the first amendment said there would not be any transfer to an adjoining district without the consent of that district, this merely says there must be no management at all. But I know what happens when one puts down amendments. The hon. Member said this was a probing amendment and that he wanted to find out what we have in mind. I was grateful that he did not talk about Layfield. Then we would not have been able to get out of Committee this side of Whitsun and probably not this year. But never mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no advice on rates, but where management is taking place and the rents are collected and the sum given in rent is inclusive of rates, I imagine there would be a balancing figure between the two authorities. The sort of situation which is envisaged in this—it is not self-evidently clear—where the development corporation is in the process of building. The hon. Member might think about this in relation to his own new town of
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
Redditch. Where a new town corporation is building an estate over a period of time, most of it within the boundaries of district A but some extending into district B, one might get the situation that it would be right, because of the period of time and the general cohesiveness of the area, that the dwellings in the area of council A should be transferred to council A, but one has a tiny wedge running into the neighbouring council area, the building in which is not complete. It might be right not to transfer it under this clause, but that it should all be managed together, for good management. This might not occur often but it is the sort of situation which one wants to watch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can perhaps give the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) an unconvenanted benefit for which he might be grateful. I said earlier that I would have a look at the wording and that I thought that Clause 3 was about the place to have that new look, and here we are at Clause 3. Perhaps he would care to accept my gift to look at the wording of this, and to see if it is necessary to tidy up the wording covered by the two sets of amendments, dealing with transfer and with management so that we can get a proper agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member. He may perhaps recollect although he may have been absent from the Chamber by the time I caught Mr. Speaker's eye on Second Reading, that I then said he had referred to Nicias the Greek and I said that we had to look carefully at Greeks and gifts, but I do not think we have to examine the mouth of this particular horse very closely. We are grateful for what has come out of the Minister's mouth on the need for agreement with councils, and the need to look again at the whole thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has referred to the expedition with which the Committee has arrived at Clause 3. The Minister is well known for the expedition with which he gets his business through Committees, but he has tempted me to delay the Committee somewhat by raising the subject of Layfield and rates. I am sure that you, Mr. Bonner Pink, will rule out of order any discussion on the failure of Layfield to report by 1975 as promised, so we will not be tempted to delay the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
Committee, especially as we wish to move on to amendments of more substance. However, I should like to probe the Minister's mind a little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had the unworthy suspicion that we were dealing with a rather hypothetical example when he was referring to the possibility that one might be building, at some future stage across the boundary of a council, an estate which it might be convenient to manage as a whole in the interest of good management. That is a laudable sentiment, but I was trying to picture the scene rather more concretely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties to which I have already made some reference is the need for corporation tenants to be consulted about these arrangements—for instance about standards of management of open spaces. It is, for example, the case that a corporation has devoted a larger share of its resources to the management of open space and landscaping than is the common practice among many district councils. When the Minister refers to proper management extending across district council boundaries, it is not clear at first blush that this would really be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asking the Minister to inform the Committee exactly why this provision is needed in this subsection, although we can accept that it may have been needed in Clause 1. It is not clear whether it is necessary here, and I should be grateful if he would be more specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think one has to go back to the original concept of the housing as it was envisaged by the development corporation. It would have been conceived that the housing to be erected would be related with open space, shopping, and so on, and that, after a period of debate this would be the basis on which the development would be done. At some time in history thereafter, certainly after reorganisation of local government, the estate might have been observed to be within two districts. For the corporation this would not have mattered, but the overwhelming bulk of the estate would be in one district council area and the rest in another. The whole estate would, in the corporation's mind, be an entity, and from the point of view of management it would not be a small
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
estate in one district and another in another, but one large estate. When one comes to a transfer scheme and the management scheme coming shortly thereafter, to split it then would be contrary to good estate management. For example, also, one may have shops which serve area 1 but are in area 2, and open spaces to which the same applies. Unless one considers the estate as an entity, the whole of the estate management might be in chaos. That is why we put these words in here, and why the powers are in this subsection and not in the earlier one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I must congratulate you, Mr. Bonner Pink, on so felicitously describing the consequential amendments—I almost said inconsequential amendments—with which this is to be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the word is "promised" or "threatened", but at the first sitting, because of the difference in meaning between "transfer" and proposed to be transferred", I said that we would have a look at this when we came to Clauses 3 and 5, and I said then that there would be a long list of consequentials with which I would have to burden the Committee. These are those amendments. I shall try to summarise them speedily, but they are technical amendments which are absolutely necessary to see that this pattern is preserved throughout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first category of amendments, Nos. 49 and 51—I make no apology for reading what is in my brief because this is technical—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should draw the attention of the Committee to the fact
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
that there is a printing error on the Notice Paper. The amendment is to leave out from "which". As printed it is to leave out "which". It is a printing error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments 49 and 51 are purely drafting and are consequential on the new definition in Clause 1(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second category of amendments achieves this. In a number of contexts in the Bill as drafted at present there are references to buildings and other land which are "subject to" management arrangements where the buildings and other land which are covered by the provisions in the scheme, but are or may be not yet managed, either because the scheme has not yet come into operation or because they have not yet become eligible for management under the arrangements—for example, because they are buildings in the course of erection. The use of the term "subject to management arrangement" denotes that the arrangements are actually in force in respect of the buildings, whereas the phrase "which are the subject of" covers both the case where the arrangements are in force and the case where they are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third category of these amendments, No. 57, 61 and 64, is designed to make clear in each context in respect of both the transfer and management provisions of the transfer scheme whether or not the reference is to a situation where the transfer has taken place, or the provisions have come into force, as the case may be, in respect of the land and buildings concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, the fourth set, Amendments 58, 59 and 65, comprises purely drafting amendments following from the third set. Amendments 58 and 59 flow from No. 57 and No. 65 flows from No. 64.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This provision shall be subject to regulations under this section by the Secretary of State, which shall he made by Statutory Instrument. Regulations shall not be made under this section unless a draft has been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament'.</p></blockquote>
On Second Reading we made clear that we accepted the principle of the Bill, though I explained that some of my hon. Friends had some reservations. We feel that the Bill should have provided an opportunity to stimulate the sale of new town houses, to sitting tenants in particular. That is what the amendment seeks to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept immediately that it is possible that the amendment is technically imperfect. Opposition amendments are sometimes, to put it mildly, technically imperfect. If the Government say that they accept the spirit of our amendment and will come up with a better drafted scheme at a later stage, there will be rejoicing on our side, and that will be that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment gives us a chance to consider something which we believe profoundly is the right approach to be taken to housing in new town areas. Why do we advocate so strongly that there should be the sale of new town houses primarily to sitting tenants? Why do we believe it is right that there should be extensive home ownership in the new towns, and that one of the most useful ways of stimulating such ownership is by the sale of existing stock?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of reasons for our advocating the sale of new town houses, and to a great extent they are the same reasons that lead us to believe that ordinary local authorities should be able
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>
to sell council houses to sitting tenants. As it happens, we have had one or two opportunities recently in the House to debate these matters. We were able to have such a debate on Second Reading, and we spent some time last week in the debate on local government considering the same matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason for our believing in the sale of council houses to tenants or new town houses—I suppose that in many ways it is the best of all reasons—is that it satisfies human aspirations. In my view, it adds to the stock of human happiness, and in many cases it is something which tenants welcome. However, if they do not like the idea they do not have to buy their house. There is no problem about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such evidence as exists demonstrates that the sale of new town houses and council houses is genuinely popular. In this context I refer to the Cullingworth Report on "The Ownership and Management of Housing in the New Towns". Admittedly it was produced a decade or so ago, but it contains some quite solid evidence on the desires of those who live in new towns. Chapter 7, in page 66, reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, though we did not ask for opinions on the relative advantages of public and individual ownership, we did ask for views on the sale of development corporation houses to tenants, and the results were startling."</p></blockquote>
Those results are given in subsequent tables, which I shall summarise. I must explain that the Cullingworth Report did some serious research. To dismiss it, as one Labour Member did recently, as some minor form of opinion poll is misleading. It was a serious piece of research that appeared in serious Government-sponsored publications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The startling results to which the report refers relates to inquiries which took place in four of the new towns, namely, Crawley, Stevenage, Aycliffe and East Kilbride. In answer to the question whether houses should be offered for sale to tenants, it appears that—I shall not read out the full details, I shall merely add together the results of the question in the four towns—12 per cent. said "No", 71 per cent. said "Yes", and 17 per cent. gave a qualified "Yes". There could not have been a much more overwhelming vote than that. The figures relate to whole town samples. The Cullingworth
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
Committee took sample opinions from everyone who lived in the areas rather than specifically questioning new town tenants. However, the Cullingworth Committee asked development corporation commission tenants for their views. It asked whether houses should be offered for sale to tenants. In the four towns added together, 13 per cent. said that they should not be offered for sale, 69 per cent. said "Yes", and 18 per cent. gave a qualified "Yes". To the question whether residents as a whole in the areas felt that tenants should have the right to buy, the answer was overwhelmingly "Yes". I hope that the Minister will take note of that piece of research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally true, although I cannot quote the same sort of research, that the desire to buy is widespread as a whole. In this instance we need not distinguish between council house tenants and new town tenants. In the 	<i>South Wales Argus</i> on 28th April 1976, for example, there was a report to the effect that no less than 2,000 Newport council house tenants have inquired about buying their homes since the authority decided, in a major shift of policy, to offer them for sale to sitting tenants. That is an indication of a strong desire to buy in many parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history of the matter is that of hostility by the present Government in their Circular 70/74, for instance, and hostility by Labour-controlled councils. That has caused a drop in the number of council houses sold from 33,720 in 1973 to 4,153 in 1974 and 1,269 in the first nine months of 1975. In financial terms that means a loss of £311 million in local government revenue between 1972–73 and 1974–75. It is not only a question of what people would like: there are important economic consequences to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason for our advocating the sale to tenants of council houses and now town houses is that it is something that people want. We have the evidence that they want it. If they do not want to buy their houses, nobody will force them to do so. At least, I shall not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our second reason is that it produces a better balance within the social composition of the new towns. In 1967 the Labour Government stated as an aim that there should be about a 50–50 balance
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
between owner occupation and rented housing. That was a target which was set and later dismissed. It was a reasonable ambition of the then Labour Government. It is sad that we have slipped so far away from it. It seems that the approach of the Labour Government during that period was altogether more reasonable than the approach of the present Labour Government. Perhaps nobody will be surprised about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I am making is that if we sell existing houses we have a chance of redressing the serious imbalance which now exists—namely, a 25–75 ratio between owner occupation and rented housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is ample evidence to confirm the view that if people own their own homes they are committed to the quality of their housing and to the improvement of it. I do not argue that every new town tenant or council tenant is careless about the quality of his housing. Many tenants put an enormous amount of effort into improving the quality of their housing, but it is true that if we own something we take extra pains to ensure that it is kept in best condition. We try to improve it, and we add improvements which often, incidentally, add to our rate burden. In many parts of the country it is often relatively easy to recognise which homes have been sold by local authorities. When we are rightly so concerned about the quality of our housing stock we must recognise that the real problem lies as much with existing stock as with providing new stock. A measure which would encourage people to look after the quality of their stock and to improve it would be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to an argument which is advanced on occasions by Labour Members. In fact, the pressure on new town housing, a reason that has been quoted by Labour Members for the Government's ban on the sale of new town houses, is diminishing. We discussed this matter last week and on Second Reading. The pressure is diminishing, but not for the reason that the Government are advancing. It is nothing to do with their change of policy towards housing. It is that the new towns are suffering from the blight which has been introduced by the Government's economic policies as a whole. The pressure of demand in most new towns is dying down
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
because jobs are not available. This is a direct consequence of the present Government's economic policies. The Minister, who is an honest man, will recognise that the lessening of pressure has far more to do with economic reasons than the housing reasons that have been advanced by his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence that waiting lists are shortening is contained in the answer to a Question by the hon. Member for the Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross) on 31st March. The hon. Gentleman asked about the estimated waiting time likely to be experienced by those seeking housing accommodation in each of the 33 new towns now managed by development corporations. The then Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Widnes (Mr. Oakes), who did a very good job in that Department, and who has now moved to the Department of Energy, gave figures relating to the new towns which serve London namely, Basildon, Bracknell, Corby, Harlow, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Peterborough and Stevenage. They are still the new towns where the pressure is highest, but in a number of new towns the waiting time is very short. The waiting time for Harlow is up to 12 weeks for key workers, otherwise up to 52 weeks. That is one of the longest waiting periods. The waiting time for Basildon is up to 26 weeks. That again is a relatively long waiting time. The waiting times for Milton Keynes, Northampton, Peterborough and Stevenage are all relatively short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It no longer makes sense to suggest that there is a great queue of people who must be accommodated in the new towns, and to use that as part of the case against the sale of new town housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, the nature of most new town housing renders it especially appropriate for sale. I recognise that that is not the case as regards some of the massive housing blocks that we see not too far away on the other side of the river. It is not likely that we would be able to sell large numbers of flats. Among other reasons, it would not be easy to do so because of management problems. Those are not areas where one would expect or ask for a dramatic sale of coun-
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
cil houses. However, most new town housing is low-rise. Much of it is either separate housing or terraced housing. I suppose that a great deal of it is terraced housing. There are some flats and maisonettes. However, as one moves around the new towns it is easy to imagine the houses being sold to their tenants. There would be no considerable management problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience shows that when it was possible to buy new town houses such purchases took place fairly readily. In practical and social terms there is a great deal to be said for the sale of new town houses. It is desirable for a variety of social and economic reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, the Conservative Government encouraged the sale of new town houses. The Conservative Government's New Towns Circular 179 of 23rd October 1970 gave the development corporations powers to offer virtually all their rented homes for sale to tenants at 20 per cent. below current market value with vacant possession. Special arrangements were made with building society associations for the provision of mortgage loans for housing being built by the corporation or commission. Under these arrangements over 2,700 homes were sold in 1971, over 15,500 in 1972 and over 7,200 in 1973. In 1974, however, the Labour Government banned further sales. I believe that that ban was unjustified at the time, and it is high time it was repealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not merely a case of there being a real desire for people to buy. There is also the point made by the late Mr. Richard Crossman when he was Minister for Housing and Local Government. On the inside front cover of the report, The Ownership and Management of Housing in the New Towns", Mr. Crossman is quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Should housing ownership and management—at present almost a corporation monopoly in most New Town Corporations—be turned into a municipal monopoly? Or should we try to evolve new forms of de-centralised housing ownership and management to fit our new communities? These are questions which have been far too little considered either by the planners or by the politicians."</p></blockquote>
He was talking about other things as well as conventional owner occupation
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
and our amendment No. 76, to be discussed later, relates to housing corporations and co-ownership. It also looks for a less monolithic pattern of ownership than exists in those places where council houses swamp the area. Mr. Crossman was right to talk about trying to break up rigidity in new towns. The best way to do that is to sell off new town and council houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known, although it is unofficial, that the majority of new town corporations favour the sale of their houses, although that may not be true for those new towns nearest London. There is a general feeling among new town corporations that that is the right thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the arguments put forward by the opponents of the sale of council houses does not stand up. That is the argument that houses are often sold back when they are bought by tenants. That fact does not invalidate our argument. If the fact that some people find they cannot maintain their commitments is thought to be a mark of failure, the argument is flimsy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now quote from the 13th Annual Report of the Commission for the New Towns for the period ended 31st March 1975. The report, directed to the Government, covers the new towns of Crawley, Hemel Hempstead, Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City. Paragraph 26 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At your request sales of rented houses to sitting tenants were suspended in April 1974 and finally ended in September 1974. A total of 5,470 houses (16 per cent. of the Commission's housing stock) were sold during the three years that they were on offer. As part of the sale transactions the Commission covenanted to buy back houses at the original sale price within the first five years, if so requested. So far 23 houses have been repurchased in this way, usually because of personal financial or marital difficulties, and the occupiers have mostly remained as tenants."</p></blockquote>
Only 23 were repurchased out of a total of 5,470—a small number. It is right that people who encounter marital or financial difficulties should have that opportunity. The arguments against resale cut no ice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Government's view about that? So far they have been unwilling to accommodate the demand for a resumption of sales. There have been promises of a review. Perhaps the
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
Minister will tell us what is happening about a review. Does he intend to permit the sale of new town houses before long? The power to sell exists. The purport of the clause we seek to amend is to enable houses to be sold, and no doubt the Minister will tell the Committee what he has in mind. We believe there should be a more positive approach based on the right to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do we approach the matter? The transfer from corporation to council is a splendid opportunity for such sales to take place. Essentially, we say in the amendment, which may be technically imperfect, that in the period preceding the actual transfer from the corporation to the council, and for a period of, say, six months afterwards, tenants should have the right to buy. They should be entitled to buy the house that otherwise would be transferred to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considered the way in which that should happen. The scheme that we put forward is sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that once the houses are fully in possession of the local authority it will exercise its duty to sell, but, we are not concerned in the Bill about long-term local authority policy. The Bill is not the vehicle for enacting the right to buy council houses in all circumstances. The Bill concerns the transfer from new town corporations to local authorities, and we are trying firmly to establish the principle of the right to buy at the time of transfer and to convert a possibility of sale into an entitlement for tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have added a period of six months after the date of transfer as the time in which that right can be exercised because it takes time to transfer and sell houses. Initially, we thought that the right to buy should be exercised in the period before the transfer, so that the local authority would have an unencumbered package, but we decided that that was not fair to tenants and that they needed a longer period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations should specify details, and perhaps include provisions for an initial payment. Once one accepts the right to buy, one has to consider terms. We have considered what is the best approach and our proposal is based on our Circular 54/70 on the sale of local authority houses. The actual details must be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
spelt out in regulations which are subject to affirmative resolution. We have a strong commitment to affirmative resolutions. It is not sensible to try to set out a full scheme in our amendment and it is reasonable for the details to be contained in regulations. That would be a proper use of delegated legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the circular is that the sale should either take place at full market value, with no conditions, or that there should be a 20 per cent. reduction in market value with certain conditions, including a pre-emption clause covering five years. The sale price should not be below the cost of providing the house in the first place, and if the house is resold by a tenant within a period of time there should be a limit on the price relating to the original selling price, plus some figure to cover the value of improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circular also covered the possibility of some form of leasehold, which is perhaps, an appropriate way of dealing with flats and maisonettes where there are common services. In those cases, perhaps, a 99 year lease is a better answer than outright sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the essence of our scheme, but I should explain why we have opted for the council house sale formula of 1970 rather than the new town sale formula which the Conservative Government introduced. The difference between them is that the formula we adopted for new towns was geared to change the balance of ownership and tenure in new towns. I share the objective of that approach, but, to show how reasonable we are, we are prepared to make a compromise. It is a concession to the Labour Party and to all those who oppose the sale of new town houses on the grounds that it will have an effect on the total housing stock. As evidence of our good will we are prepared to make a compromise by opting for the 1970 council house formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be technical faults in our amendment but our argument on the fundamentals is sound. It is a commonsense approach, based on the belief that people should be given as much freedom as possible over the destiny of their own lives. Our amendment strikes a blow for commonsense and freedom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. I was talking about a discount of 20 per cent. on the market value. I said that they should not be sold at below their original cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be a little sleepy this morning, having had a late night in the House last night, but I do not remember the hon. Gentleman saying anything about a discount. He talked about the cost of the house, and perhaps he was referring to Conservative authorities who sold houses at cost. Suppose I heard him correctly to say that they should be sold at the original cost—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon.

Let us accept the principle of a 20 per cent. discount. Why should Conservatives throughout the country, who have an addiction to market forces, now abandon that principle? When the hon. Member speaks of a change of attitude towards the balance of private and rented accommodation in new towns in recent years, he knows this was caused by the last Conservative Government's housing policy of restricting the public sector artificially and pushing people to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
buy houses they subsequently could not afford.

There are enormous waiting lists in many areas. The list in Preston is the biggest I have ever known. The local authority has had to increase its housing programme to cope with the problem, but it is woefully insufficient. We are looking to the Central Lancashire New Town to provide some relief with more rented accommodation. I can understand why the Government have changed the policy of new towns from 25 per cent. rented accommodation to 50 per cent. or more because of the urgent need in many areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury spoke about the need to increase the proportion of people owning their homes. This is a laudable aim which we support, but Britain already compares very favourably in this respect with our EEC partners and with most other countries. We have a majority of owner-occupiers in this country and, as the standard of living improves, the number is growing all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to remember the most needy sector, the people who are deprived of good housing conditions and who create social problems. Such families tend to have more children than average and the sector is consequently maintained at a fairly high level. The Opposition sometimes forget the purpose of Government-assisted rented accommodation. Market forces cannot provide decent housing for all. For that reason, all parties agreed in the early years of this century that it was essential to improve housing conditions. A 	<i>laissez-faire</i> system could not provide these conditions. We saw this in the nineteenth century, with dire consequences for our country. It was costly to the community, as we saw when men had health examinations during the First World War.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was because of this situation that the provision of decent housing was regarded as a national necessity. Hence all the subsequent legislation to provide good housing. That principle remains. Waiting lists are still very long, and, as long as that situation exists, we cannot afford to sell publicly-owned houses which provide good living conditions at low cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
The Opposition sneer about subsidised council housing, ignoring the fact that there are many subsidies for many things in life. Of all the subsidies this is the most essential, because it provides a means of breaking the vicious circle by which deprived families generate deprived families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more essential than ever that we maintain a full stock of housing. Demands are continually made from this side for the number of council houses to be increased. Would it not be utterly foolish to reduce the number? I hope the Minister will not give way on this matter which is essential to our ideology. The Opposition should search their consciences and realise that rented accommodation is an essential social service. I hope they will join with us in recognising the need to deal with this urgent problem in our society and to provide conditions which will lead to a better life for the people of this country and increase our economic prosperity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stanley Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I oppose the amendment, though I do not oppose home ownership. On the contrary, I welcome it. Like many others, the Harlow Development Corporation built houses specifically for sale and, as the owner-occupier of a property bought from the, Harlow Development Corporation, I am practising what I preach. My hon. Friends and I do not oppose home ownership in new towns, but there is a difference between selling houses which are built for sale and diminishing the rented stock by selling these properties. That is why I oppose the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) said that waiting lists in new towns were no longer as large as they used to be, but it is my experience that, even in new towns, housing is still the biggest problem. Let hon. Members look at the communities and areas which new towns have to serve. There is no doubt that they have appalling housing problems. The amendment would help to deprive people of their place in the queue for a house to rent, and that would be totally wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are different categories of people wanting a house to rent in new towns. They include second generation applications, relatives of existing tenants, those
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
seeking work in the town, and many others who do not qualify but who are homeless. There is no question but that the more the rented stock is diminished, the more the possibility of getting housing for these categories is diminished, and the more waiting lists are lengthened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Houses which become available for renting include new houses as well as those vacated by tenants. If one sells houses to existing tenants, it is inevitable that waiting lists will lengthen, that rent levels will be pushed up, and that things will be made even more difficult for people who cannot afford to buy. If a tenant wishes to buy a house, why should he not buy one of those available for sale in new towns or elsewhere? There is no shortage of such properties. I see no reason why we should sell the existing stock while there are still problems raised by sales of rented accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the principal issues is that tenants who buy cannot always afford to keep up payments. They may change their jobs or be made redundant and lose income. Others find that the increased payments caused by rises in the mortgage interest rate put them in severe economic difficulties. At regular intervals I am approached by people in Harlow who have taken on a mortgage to purchase property but cannot continue the payments because their marriages have broken up. Are we saying that development corporations should provide such people with a tenancy? This would not be fair to people on the waiting list. This is a serious problem which I hope the Opposition will consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some tenants are anxious to buy because of the reduced price they are offered. I know of a case of a key worker who bought his house and sought to capitalise on the lower price by selling it at the earliest moment. He then went back to his employer and said he had had to move and asked the employer to approach the development corporation for another tenancy for him in the town. To his credit, the employer refused, but, because he wanted the key worker, he waited until a house came up for sale in the town, bought it and rehoused the worker. That worker obtained a house and made money out of depriving somebody else who could have had that pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
perty. This is not fair, and we must not permit it to continue, as it would were the amendment carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do the Opposition think it right that a tenant who buys from a development corporation or local council should receive what is, in effect, a subsidy from the Government? That is what the 20 per cent. discount means. To replace that particular unit, any authority has to pay out that additional money. Therefore one is giving that particular individual a subsidy. I do not see how that can be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is such a good thing, I would like to ask the hon. Member for Aylesbury why we should not then force all landlords, including private landlords, to sell their houses to tenants, and at a 20 per cent. discount. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Why should we not do that? The hon. Member for Aylesbury should face up clearly to this question. I do not think he would find himself all that popular with the traditional base of his party, namely the landlords. It is a serious problem, and I wonder why he and other hon. Members opposite do not advocate that measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is uneconomic to sell off houses in a pepper pot fashion. Most people who live in new towns say this because where there are odd houses to maintain in an area it is more expensive per unit to maintain and manage them. This is generally recognised by people who have to deal with this. I have discussed it with people in my own new town. There are people who are unable to maintain houses. The hon. Member for Aylesbury said the evidence that people are unable to maintain them is flimsy. That is because in the new towns the people on the whole are young. When people become older they find great difficulty in maintaining houses. It is wrong that we should foist this on people because they fear, at a certain stage in their lives, that it is desirable. I have seen many people who would be only too glad to get rid of their houses, which they have bought, if only they could get a secure tenancy in their old age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong that we should sell off these houses. I repudiate any suggestion
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
that I and those associated with me oppose in principle owner occupation in the new towns. I oppose the amendment, and I am sure my right hon. Friend will support me. Whatever the limits which the hon. Member for Aylesbury set out as concessions to the Labour Party, I still believe that the amendment, if carried, would be thoroughly pernicious. I hope it will be rejected today as it has been rejected by the Government when the issue has been raised in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joseph Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At regular intervals we appear to have had the question of the sale of local authority housing stock as a major plank in forthcoming elections, general or local. The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) himself said that it was with one eye on the elections of this Thursday that the Opposition were using a Supply Day for a debate last week on local government. One of the main features of that debate was the mandatory sale of council houses. This Bill means that the new town authority houses will eventually become council houses. Though the amendment deals specifically with new town houses one is really talking about the end product and what it will be when this Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is often said that the sale of council houses to tenants is a wonderful electoral gimmick, but I have never known from experience that this is a fact. The Opposition would have done well to have done their homework in some areas where it has been tried as a gimmick and failed abysmally. Let us take what happened in a city which is one of the largest housing authorities in this country—Manchester. When the Conservatives took control in 1967 they quickly set in operation a scheme for the purchase of council houses at a 20 per cent. discount. Then things started to change, and instead of a Labour Government we had a Conservative Government returned in 1970. One knows how the pendulum nearly always swings away from the Government at local elections. To try to redress the balance that had started to move against the scheme a legalised electoral bribe was brought into operation by the leader of the council, Alderman Fieldhouse. A scheme was instituted in a matter of weeks and it was promised that if they were returned to office in 1971 the Conservatives would immediately increase the maximum discount
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
to 30 per cent. Every council house tenant in Manchester was briefed on this issue. I am bound to tell the Opposition of the results of that election, which was a mini-general election, because every seat in Manchester was up for contention. Out of a total of 99 seats up for election, the Conservative Party, which had been in control, won 18 seats and the Labour Party won the rest. So historically the facts do not prove that even an electoral bribe will win an election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury used a large whitewash brush on a dirty wall in inferring that all was good about the sale of publicly-owned houses. The hon. Member took the trouble to mention four new town authorities that were mentioned in the report to which he referred. Quite by chance those four new towns are in the South-Eastern belt of the country, mainly the affluent region of England. I am not too sure that this standard could be applied to the new towns in the North-East and in the depressed areas. I cannot see anybody, with the high rate of unemployment appertaining in those other areas, suddenly opting to load themselves with debt for the purchase of a particular house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some serious pitfalls in a sudden glut of houses in public ownership coming on to the market. What was proved when certain major local authorities instituted this policy was that there was not enough professional staff in the country even to value them. In the city in which I was involved at the time there were houses which had been built at the same time, of completely the same type, and which should have been valued the same, but because there were two sets of valuers let loose from the private sector they were being valued by a differential of as much as £1,000. Some of the houses were sold for as little as £1,700 and £1,900 with a 20 per cent discount. They were almost given away, criminally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened then, as soon as the five-year period of time was up, was that there were applications to sell them back to the corporation for between £9,000 and £10,000. Where there was a heavy waiting list, the corporation or the local authority had no option. It had to buy them back. It needed them. They should never have been let go in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
It is said that one does not gain a house, because a family has to live in it, but the movement from council houses into owner-occupation is a pretty high percentage. That is one of the reasons why I think the amendment ought to be rejected. The situation is that These new towns will be going to a lot of authorities which have a considerable housing stock of their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As municipal development takes place—and I am not blaming any Government for this—we have had some odd types of development foisted on local authorities. Some of the large local authorities have a large stock of housings or buildings which are not desirable by modern standards, and some of them were built as recently as a decade ago. I am talking about when subsidies were arranged and given to encourage people to build flats with lifts and the proliferation of multistorey flats. These have created for families some of the most unsociable conditions, almost as bad as the slums they were taken out of. I challenge the hon. Member for Aylesbury to show me where there has been any application for people to purchase this type of accommodation. It is clear that the local authorities that decided to sell houses sold the best houses, because they were the best value for money. Some of the buildings then built were walk-up flats; these are the ones nobody wants to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish hon. Members opposite would get away from imagining that the normal council house tenant is in receipt of favourable treatment that ought to be accorded to new town dwellers, whether first or second generation. I said last week, and it is as well to underline it, that had the local authority housing revenue account, or the local authority tenant, been allowed tax relief at the same rate as the owner-occupier, neither Conservative nor Labour Governments before 1973 would have needed to provide one penny subsidy. The money paid in debt charges far outweighed anything that would have been allowed on tax relief. Only since the tremendous increase in inflation in the last few years has one figure overturned the other. For that one can check the figures of Henry Aughton, the well-known public-spirited
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
servant who has done an immense amount of research in municipal housing areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not glibly say that there is no place at all for the sale of council houses. If one has an over-proliferation in some areas one might find odd cases, but it would be disastrous if this Committee were to give any instruction that the people living in new town houses ought to have the option to buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury was saying last week that the Conservative Party was the champion of local democracy. I find it odd that he used the term "a duty to sell", which would mean compulsion. The authorities would be made to sell. Local politics being what they are, while these options are open, the electors might decide to elect a local authority which will sell houses. That is an option which should remain with the local authority. The "duty to sell" would be opposite to what the hon. Members opposite said last week when they spoke of championing local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helene Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not delay the Committee long, but reading an amendment like this makes me think that perhaps Conservative Members live in a different world, or that different sorts of people go to their surgeries or write to them for help with their problems</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member's intervention because in the limited time I have had the privilege of representing two new towns—more than anyone else on the Committee—I have not had a single person come to me with the problem that he is not able to buy from the council or from the New Towns Commission. I have not added up the number of people who have come to me because they are not able to rent accommodation in Welwyn and Hatfield area, but I trust that the Committee will believe me if I say that it is a considerable number
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be charitable to say that hon. Members opposite are perhaps talking out of ignorance rather than from anything else. It might be useful if I offer the Committee some experience from an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
old new town, a new town in the South-East, one of the richer areas, because it is in just such areas where the stress on rented houses increases and does not diminish as time goes on. The attitude towards council tenants who need housing, the attitude which emerges from an argument of this kind, is worrying. There is an assumption that the only people we are dealing with are the standard colour supplement family with 2·4 children, having moderate means to pay rent and the means to get a mortgage. That is not the real world in which we live. We are living in a time when the numbers and categories of people desiring rented accommodation are increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have here the report, March 1976, of the Welwyn-Hatfield Local Committee of the Commission for the New Towns on Housing for Retired Parents". This report shows that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The increase over the last five years of numbers of elderly people looking for rented accommodation has been so great that the waiting list is currently standing at 502 households requiring accommodation whereas we are providing 94 such dwellings a year."</p></blockquote>
The recommendation ends:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In view of the fact that the demand is so much greater than the supply it would seem reasonable to close the elderly persons waiting list rather than give false hopes to the majority of elderly applicants."</p></blockquote>
We are told that waiting lists are diminishing. That is nonsense. If they were open to all the people who need rented accommodation the lists would be far greater. Have hon. Members opposite never had ex mental hospital patients coming in, desperate for housing for single people, but ineligible for any sort of list? Perhaps if they got an institutes of higher education in their constituencies they would realise some of the problems in an area which has a good stock of modern housing where there is no old Victorian privately-owned property to rent for students; there is nowhere where students can live. It is exactly the same for young people wanting to leave home and get jobs. There is no opportunity to find a bedsitter in an area which has—we are grateful not to have some of the problems of this—no stock of old houses. We do not have the problems associated with old housing, but the lack of it brings problems of its own particularly for young married people. This is a problem
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
which, I say seriously to hon. Members opposite, they will find more and more as the populations of their new towns grow older.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings us to the problem in Welwyn and Hatfield, of young people getting married and setting up homes on their own. They cannot afford mortgages to buy properties in the area. There is no shortage of properties to buy, but they could not afford it, even at the 20 per cent. discount suggested, and wrong though that concept is. They are starting married life and desperately need public rented accommodation if they are to have any chance of starting that life decently. Rather than having the problems of living with parents and in-laws, second and third generations are leaving the area and the families with whom they were brought up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be a tragedy for the new towns if they were to lose these sorts of people because we are so shortsighted as to put on the market those houses on which we have spent so much money, time, and care to provide in the new towns. Any movement towards diminishing the stock of rented housing in the new towns, and what will be the future stock of district councils, is regressive. It shows no appreciation of the way in which council house waiting lists are extending and will extend more. The sorts of people I have mentioned will look more and more to the public sector to provide rented accommodation when the private landlord has gone. The effect of the amendment would be a diminution of the contribution which new towns have made to housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was slightly amused to hear the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) talking of electoral gimmicks. I am not interested in electoral gimmicks. I have not approached this issue from the aspect of electoral advantage.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must consider the matter on the basis of the facts. This is a matter of which I have personal experience. I quite agree that there are categories who are seeking accommodation, but we have to consider why they are seeking rented accommodation and why the waiting lists have fluctuated in the manner they have. It was not long ago, as the Minister knows from my correspondence with him and from remarks in the House, that the difference to the wage-earner between buying and renting a house was about £1 a week. Because of the inflation in wages and materials which has since taken place, that gap has dramatically widened, so that, as Labour Members have pointed out, it is no longer realistic to think in terms of being able to buy a house at the present differentials between subsidised rents and mortgage repayments. When the differential was down to the level I have spoken of, as recently as 1971 and 1972 in the case of my new town, although in others it may have been different, the corporation suddenly found that it had seriously over-provided houses to rent because factory workers and others wished to buy, because of that small differential. With the widening of the differential there has been a lengthening of the waiting list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must join issue with the Government when they say that no more accommodation will be available for young marrieds, for elderly relatives, for students or for other categories because of the terms of the amendment, which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any transfer scheme shall include arrangements whereby tenants of dwellings to be transferred are given the right to purchase".</p></blockquote>
I shall not deal at this stage with the remarks of the hon. Member for Leeds, West, as he is not in the Committee at present. The hon. Gentleman referred to those who buy a council or corporation house and sell it back to the council or corporation at a profit. We are talking in terms of an amendment which seeks to provide that those to be transferred are given the right to buy. No one is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
compelling them to buy anything or to enter into a financial commitment they do not wish to undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind Labour Members that many tenants moved into new towns when they had a right to buy their house. That was made plain to them when they moved in, as in the same manner was the layout of the estate as my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) pointed out. It seems likely that that right is to be removed from them on the transfer of the assets. All that the amendment is seeking to do is to provide that the tenants of dwellings to be transferred are given what used to be their right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it will be to the advantage of the Committee if the right hon. Gentleman tells us how many tenants in new towns took up residence with the right to purchase. I do not know whether the information is readily available in his Department, but it might be of assistance to have an indication of the numbers involved. We could then consider the problems in a practical manner. As I have said, the amendment merely seeks to give the tenants the right to purchase their dwellings, subject to conditions laid out in Circular 54/70.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that the conditions provided for a period in which the council or borough had the first right to repurchase should the tenant leave or prove unable to maintain his mortgage payments. I have had experience in my new town of former tenants who bought their homes and who Droved unable to keep up the mortgages payments. I have been able to arrange for the corporation to buy them back at the price at which they were sold originally, and those who were buying their house on mortgage continue to occupy them as tenants. It is not necessary to enter into some of the emotional flights that some have entered on the subject of the amendment. Let us remember that no one is being compelled to buy his house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the numbers involved, if the Minister is able to help us, and at the economic situation which has led to an increase in demand for rented accommodation. In my new town it now costs the corporation about £16,000 to build a house to Parker-Morris standards. The subsidy on those houses is now well in
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
excess of £1,200 a year. In some cases it is reaching £30 a week. I am sure that Labour Members will appreciate that it is not possible for any Government, whatever their political convictions, to find the finance in the immediate, foreseeable future to enable local authorities to continue building houses and renting them, given the demand for rented accommodation, at rents which are subsidised to the extent that I have mentioned. We must recognise that the public finance is not available.

I draw attention to a second principle involving tenants of rented dwellings, especially those who are tenants in local authority dwellings which were built in the 1920s. Under the system of pool rents these unfortunate tenants are already paying more by way of rent than they would have had to pay on a mortgage to buy their house. I am sure that Labour Members must have come across many such cases in the areas that they represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not start trying to distinguish between Labour-controlled areas, as being more or less affluent or afflicted, than areas under other political control. I inform Labour Members that the discussions I have had with motor car manufacturers, the managers of general stores and others have convinced me that there is more disposable income available in the large manufacturing towns north of the Wash, as evidenced by the weekly sales figures for Sainsbury's and by the sales figures for motor cars. It seems that there is more disposable income available for such purchases in those areas. It cannot be claimed that any one party represents a more or less depressed or affluent area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in all areas we must think of tenants in houses which were built in the 1920s, tenants who, under the pool rent system, are paying very much more for their houses by way of rent than they would have had to pay if they had decided to buy by means of a mortgage. That situation will inexorably extend to more and more houses as rents have to increase throughout the country because the Government do not have the public money available to continue subsidising more and more rents at higher and higher levels. This is a very real situation. I am not trying to approach it by any form of

	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
electoral gimmickry. It is a real financial problem that must cause the right hon. Gentleman very much concern. No doubt he will be returning to it in his remarks upon the amendment. I say to the hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) that the market forces are operating because of the lack of finance available to the Government and the other authorities.

It cannot be questioned that public housing is low-cost housing. I have already referred to a rented corporation house in Redditch costing £16,000 on the latest contract, whereas on the latest contracts it is still possible to find a house costing £9,000. Admittedly the private house will not be built to Parker-Morris standards, but it will be built to the National Housebuilders Registration Council's 10-year guarantee standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many people who cannot understand why public housing should be provided at a higher standard and at a higher subsidy than is available for owner-occupiers. We are often told about the tax relief on mortgage interest that is available to owner-occupiers. That should be assessed in the light of subsidies that are available to tenants of rented accommodation. Based on the latest figures I have seen, the typical tax relief on mortgage interest on a private house of the sort that I have mentioned, a house costing £8,500—and there are still houses available at that figure in Redditch—is £340 a year, subject to certain assumptions, as opposed to well over £1,200 in the rented sector. I am not trying to make any political point. I am merely saying there is an economic case to put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joseph Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not disputing the figures and comparisons that the hon. Gentleman is making, but we must not overlook that the municipal tenant finds that subsidies are of such dimension that the overwhelming proportion of the exercise is taken up in interest charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of interest charges is a matter that will detain us when we come to the financial aspects of the Bill. In the financial provisions we realise that the Treasury subsidy to the

new towns is not open-ended either in financial terms or in time, and may come to an end. That will have the most disastrous consequences for local authorities and their tenants. That is an aspect we shall explore later when we consider the financial clauses.

I conclude my remarks on the amendment by a brief reference to the amount of owner occupation in this country as compared with that in Common Market countries, a factor to which the hon. Member for Preston, North referred. I believe that owner occupation in this country is about 52 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 53 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. It is 53 per cent. I do not have available the figures for the Common Market, but I accept what was said by the hon. Member for Preston, North. However, I must point out that there is a much larger private rented sector in the other Common Market countries. We have had to suffer from the decline of the private rented sector owing to the legislation of Labour Governments and the financial subsidies available to the public rented sector. If we consider the amount of owner occupation that exists in America, or in the older Commonwealth countries, we find that the percentage is a great deal higher. It is typically over 80 per cent.

We should not consider these matters only from a political point of view. We should deal with the real factual problems that are before us. Among them is the evidence that there were tenants who had the right to buy their houses. The amendment in no way seeks to compel anyone to buy anything. It merely seeks to preserve the rights of certain tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
