<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee rose on Thursday, we had for some time found ourselves involved in the thicket of difficulties which surrounded the definition of religious belief for the purposes of this Bill. The Minister had been helpful to the Committee, first, by drawing attention to the fact that this clause had to be read in the context of the definition clause—in particular page 42—and, second, by his readiness to recognise two things: first, that subsection (2) of Clause 57 needs to be looked at again in relation to the manner in which it covers atheism and agnosticism—that is to say, the absence or supposed absence of religion—and, secondly, I think I do him no injustice in saying that he had frankly recognised the difficulties attendant upon a definition of something so subjective as religious belief for purposes so objective as those of an Act of Parliament which is administered by legal and sub-legal machinery.<br><br>
We shall have an opportunity of returning to these matters when we come to the definition clause, as well as at a later stage of the Bill. In the light of the Minister's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
appreciation of the seriousness of the debate on the amendment which will require study before we consider Clause 57, my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) will perhaps not seek to divide the Committee—I cannot speak for him—and we can therefore make progress with this clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert J. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In due course I shall beg leave to withdraw the amendment, but I should like first to underwrite the comment made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) because in subsection (2) of Clause 57, in relation to the amendment, it is clear that there are at least two absurdities. We hope to return later to this subsection and, in some way, draw from the Government an assurance of reconsideration of this clause and, indeed, the wording in Clause 3.<br><br>
The two absurdities are, first, that we find included references to supposed religion and to the absence of any or particular religious belief—to my mind, it is difficult to include that which does not exist—and, secondly, it is absurd to ask that something should be included which is indeed absent. Therefore, one would have to revert not to the ascertaining of religious belief but to one's political philosophy and, if that did not help, to one's area of birth, to one's school, and so on, <i>ad infinitum.</i><br><br>
I leave the matter there, because the contributions of my right hon. Friend and other of my hon. Friends have already outlined the great difficulty arising here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I respond to the point made by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) in relation to Clause 57(2), which we have discussed in line with Clause 3. I take very much on board what the right hon. Gentleman said about clause 57(2) and the supposed absence of religious belief. We are looking at this and will be drafting an amendment to meet this point when we come to Clause 57(2) and I hope that that meets at least one of the points raised.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the amendments to which the Committee has just returned, we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
been considering one only of the difficulties that the endeavour at definition, which is indispensable, has the effect of highlighting. I want to refer to something which may present a wider difficulty and which goes even closer to the root of the matter and to our objections to this whole approach to discrimination and equality of opportunity.<br><br>
I should like to focus the attention of the Committee on the words in subsection (2) (<i>b</i>) of this clause:
<br><blockquote><p>"… due allowance being made for any material difference in their suitability."</p></blockquote>
I do so, not in order to query the precise wording, which would be improper at this stage, but to raise what, I concede, is a matter of principle which the necessity of finding some such wording as that serves to emphasise. It is of the nature of such words as "due allowance" and "material difference" that they are highly subjective and that the difference between two candidates for a post, which to one person might appear unimportant, may, to another, appear to be decisive. Again, there may be a difference between the two candidates which might be a difference in an area which one employer would regard as irrelevant to the interests of a job, and which another, in all good faith and without any religious discrimination, might regard as highly relevant.<br><br>
I do not think that it is a flight of imagination to invite the Committee to consider what must be a normal situation for a prospective employer or personnel manager who may be interviewing two or three people for a job. We all know what I mean by saying that in that situation, one can have the impression that the candidate selected is the man who fits. The paper qualifications of A, B and C, for all practical purposes, are the same. Certainly they are all above the minimum limits which may have been fixed for the job. A, B and C are all men who, in the opinion of the interviewer, would do the job adequately and satisfactory. Yet there is something about C which causes the personnel manager to say "That is a born sales representative. There is something about that chap that tells me that he will fit this job in a way that the other applicants will not."<br><br>
I have chosen the example of a sales representative because we all know, though we would be hard put to define it, what we mean by "a born salesman",
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
and I defy anybody, unless there is a question of a previous record, in an abstract list of qualifications—a numbered proforma to be filled out by the applicants—to include in it characteristics which fit together, to define what we all mean by "a born salesman". As I have said, I have taken the case of a vacancy for a salesman, but what I have suggested applies, to a greater or less degree, to almost any appointment which requires to be made.<br><br>
I concede that in the hiring and firing—and I hope that it will be more hiring than firing in Northern Ireland—of unskilled labour and, to a considerable extent, of skilled labour, this difficulty to which I refer can hardly arise. Indeed, I am prepared to concede that if an employer or a personnel manager sought to apply this kind of subtlety in taking on unskilled labour, one might deduce that he was looking for differences which were not material and that he was trying to make allowances which were not due allowances.<br><br>
But this Bill is not confined to unskilled labour. It is not even confined to tradesmen, the supply of whom, even with the regrettably high overall level of unemployment in Northern Ireland, is, as the Minister of State knows well, extremely tight in some areas and for some purposes. But the Bill covers a whole range of employments and, without hesitation, I submit that taking the whole range of employments which it covers, there are numerous circumstances in which it is part of the duty and responsibility of an employer—if he is directly responsible—and the personnel manager, to be sensitive to such differences which, from his experience, he has found will fit one man for a post and not another.<br><br>
The consequence of both this and subsequent parts of the Bill is that such a person making such a decision may well find himself called to account to say what differences he found in a number of candidates' suitability and what allowances he made. I wonder whether that is an onus —at any rate, in the form in which it stands in this definition clause—which it is realistic to place upon employers and personnel managers.<br><br>
We are, as this clause once again reminds us, endeavouring to make matters justiciable which hitherto they have not been, and we are intending to make the difference between the way in which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 99</span>
various firms handle those matters, the difference of success and failure for those firms. Let us not put too fine a point on it, but that is what Part III is all about: We shall penalise firms if the agency, subject to appeal, believes that firms are not furnishing equality of opportunity.<br><br>
Therefore, it is no light matter to attend to the precise terms in which the equality of opportunity is to be envisaged, because the Appeals Board, to which we shall come in the next clause, must direct its mind, and must direct its legal mind, to due allowance and material difference in suitability.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to consider, whatever may be their point of view on the general approach in this Bill, the danger of the Bill, as drafted, leading to the position which I have envisaged of a personnel manager being hauled before the agency, in effect, or the Appeals Board and being invited to say, "Well, there were these three candidates A, B and C, Mr. X. We found that A was a Roman Catholic. We found that B was a Socinian" —and that is possible, because those of us who studied the census returns for Northern Ireland, which provide us with these lurid details, have discovered the existence of a substantial number of Socinians in the Province; and assuming that B was prepared, for the purposes of the investigation, to come clean, I am by no means romancing when I suppose that B might be a Socinian—"and we found that C was a non-subscribing Presbyterian", which also happens to be the church of Mr. X, the personnel manager.<br><br>
This is what will happen. If it is not going to happen, we do not need this part of the Bill and, arguably, we do not need the Bill. But this is what we are asking for, by the manner in which the Bill is drawn.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
"Now, Mr. X" says the tribunal, "you knew that A, B and C were respectively Roman Catholic, Socinian and non-subscribing Protestant, and you chose to give the preference, in appointment to this job, to a member of your own Church, applicant C. Would you kindly tell us what difference you found in their suitability for the job to which you appointed C? Was it a difference in their standards of education?"—"No, sir." "Was it a difference in their experience?"— "Well,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
no sir. As a matter of fact, they have none of them done work of that sort before." "Then, Mr. X, would you care to tell the board the reasons why your choice fell upon C?"—"Well, sir," replies X, "I have been personnel manager in this firm for 12 years, so a good many applicants have gone through my hands, and I reckon I have a fair feeling for the type of person who is going to fit this job." "What do you mean, Mr. X, by 'the type of person'?"—"He has to be a pushful chap, sir, to exude confidence in the product that he has to sell." "But, Mr. X, are you really telling us that, having looked at Mr. A"—Mr. A in the meantime has another job and is doing very well in it—"with all your experience, you did not think that Mr. A could promote the sale of the product of your employer?"—"Well, no sir, I would not go so far as to say that. But, you know, sir, it is a matter of flair; you get a feeling between three people that that is the man for the particular job." "I see. Thank you very much, Mr. X. That will do."<br><br>
Has the board or the agency or, in cases of enforcement the county court, ascertained that there was a material difference in the suitability of A and C, and have they ascertained whether X made due, or undue, allowance for it? I submit that it would be impossible with any good conscience to come to that conclusion. So what are they going to do? What will happen in practice?<br><br>
I will say what I and my hon. Friends fear will happen, human nature being what it is. The agency will say, "We are an agency for promoting equality of opportunity. We have got to be seen to be doing something. We know that there is some discrimination." The van Straubenzee Report states that it
<br><blockquote><p>"exists to some degree as a fact of life …"</p></blockquote>
Says the agency, "We know that; it is in the van Straubenzee Report. Here is an instance of a Presbyterian being appointed, and we cannot find any reason that we can get our hands on as to why the Roman Catholic was not appointed. What is to prevent us, in this case, from saying that we find that there was no material difference between the candidates, and that undue allowance was made by the employer or personnel manager for his personal prejudices by which, no doubt, unintentionally"—and,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
of course, unintentional discrimination is included in discrimination—"he was swayed?"<br><br>
Would not anybody be swayed in judgment of those characteristics? I do not know about non-subscribing Presbyterianism, but I have heard it alleged that one of the characteristics of the northern Protestant, and of the Scottish Protestant is that as a businessman, he has that hard determination and pushfulness which brings success. What wonder then if there were a prejudice between these co-religionists which resulted in the appointment of C. I do not believe that we should put that kind of onus either upon the agency or upon those bodies to which appeals will be carried.<br><br>
We have not the opportunity to examine this matter in detail because your wisdom —and I do not query it in any way, Mr. Crawshaw—precludes us at this stage from a verbal examination of the clause. I am therefore obliged to record the doubt as to whether it will be possible to define
<br><blockquote><p>"due allowance and material difference"</p></blockquote>
—the real meaning of which we might understand in the general context—in such a way that the consequences which will flow from the attempt to apply the clause will not be the consequences which led my hon. Friends and myself to invite the House of Commons to reject the Bill, namely, that we believe that it will do more harm and prove more divisive in its presence than in its absence.<br><br>
If one is looking for an illustration of that danger, I think it is to be found in this definition clause, in the problems which beset the very attempt to define so general a concept as equality of opportunity, in order to render it the subject of civil, and potentially, of criminal procedures, by reason of the provisions of this Bill.<br><br>
I do not know whether it will be our decision when we have heard the debate that this clause is so bad that it ought not stand part of the Bill. Obviously if we enact the Bill, there must be some sort of definition. However, I place on record that the more we study the terminology of the definition, with the warmest good will—granted the principle established as we proceed—the more anxious we become about the consequences of the attempt to work this legislation.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tom Litterick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must confess that I was surprised to hear what I heard as I came through the door rather late—for which I apologise. The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) appeared to be speaking out of ignorance, not of Ulster, but of how businesses run their affairs and how businesses should run their affairs.<br><br>
One of the by-products of this type of legislation, which I welcome, is that for the first time hundreds of employers in Ulster—as, indeed, thousands of employers on the mainland in the United Kingdom—are obliged to look carefully at the way in which they select employees. The community, through this legislative assembly, has decided to define what I will call this "X factor" in the selection process for employment. In effect it is saying that this X factor is unacceptable as a criterion by which people should be given jobs, and opportunities to work.<br><br>
May I use an historical analogy? When Britain entered the Second World War, her armed forces were led by an officer corps which had been selected on what we call an "old boy" system. These people had been selected for commissions on precisely the kind of X factor we are discussing in the Bill. They seemed good chaps, just like those who were doing the selection. We know what happened. The people selected were those who had gone to a certain type of school and who came from a certain background. Then came the war, and we quickly discovered that our armed forces were being led by the most incompetent bunch of boobies that ever went to war. The Committee might bear it in mind that the response of the community and the armed services to the thunderous failure of those who had been selected on the basis of the magic X factor was to institute formal and professionalised selection procedures for the armed services, in line with the business of aptitude and intelligence tests. I understand that the right hon. Member was subjected to them himself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Litterick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman must have been in the cookhouse when the inspecting officer came along.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just stood out anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Litterick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Modesty was never one of the right hon. Gentleman's weaknesses.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0063">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 103</span>
The response of the armed forces to a crisis in their own internal administration was to institute professional selection procedures.<br><br>
I suggest that the pressure which the Bill will exert on industry in Northern Ireland as similar legislation is exerting in the mainland United Kingdom is to force those who select would-be employees at the very least to eliminate the X factor from their considerations and to use properly professionalised selection procedures. If I may bore the Committee for a few minutes, there is nothing mystical about this: it is the essence of selection procedures in modern management that they should be demystified. No general manager worth his salt would accept from a personnel manager or selection officer that he had a hunch that a particular person was a fine fellow.<br><br>
The procedure is quite simple: one starts by describing the job one wishes to fill, and from that detailed description of the job one abstracts a specification for a human being of the qualities of mind and physique, of training and aptitude which are required to do the job. The other half is that one looks at human beings and judges them in terms of those formalised, and, more often than not, quantified criteria, leaving out the mystical X factor—therefore, from a managerial point of view, reducing, but not eliminating, the probability of error. This is the effect of professionalised selection procedures.<br><br>
I am well aware that there are many firms that do not have professional managers in the sense that they are professionally trained. I suggest that that is their problem. When the agency or appeals board or whatever approaches a company and asks on what criteria a particular person was selected, it will have to justify itself. As a professional manager I say "Hear, hear". I can assure everyone in this Committee that it is quite hopeless to try to argue whether one man rather than another should be selected for a job unless one starts from commonly-agreeed criteria. Therefore, it seems that this is quite sensible in that for the first time, I am quite certain, hundreds of firms in Northern Ireland will have to formalise their selection procedures. This will not only benefit the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> sectarian discrimination, but every industrial and commercial organisation in Ulster, because most of them will have, for the very first time, to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
have formal selection procedures and recognisable selection criteria. I can assure hon. Members that that is a huge advantage and will help not only the situation we have been discussing, but the efficiency of Northern Ireland's industries.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that what we have just heard will be very helpful to the Committee. In many respects it sets the scene even more perfectly for the arguments which my right hon. Friend has made. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) rightly says, the problem which personnel management has grappled with over the years—on which no satisfactory conclusion has yet been reached—is how, having done one's job description and arrived at one's job specification, one can then objectively match the individual with the specification. With all the techniques available, psychological tests, aptitude tests, personality tests—one could list them <i>ad infinitum</i>—at the end of the day, as the hon. Gentleman knows, one is still faced with the human predicament of trying to assess something in that personality which cannot be assessed by a test. For all the failings of the interview, frequently the final decision whether the person meets the specification depends on the outcome of the interview and on the feeling which the interviewer has, and one is left with the crunch issue of this aspect, whatever it happens to be.<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman is saying that he has so perfectly refined his selection procedures, and that he was never left in any doubt about the right man for the job, I look forward to seeing a book published which will become a bible for the Institute of Personnel Management.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Litterick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a whole library of books. The hon. Gentleman should consult it. There is an infinite number of books showing how the skills have been developed over the past 30 years. They are not precise but they have a high degree of sophistication.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what I am saying. These skills have been refined and are being refined continuously. People are still seeking to remove the objectivity from selection. One spends a couple of years on these courses, being taught the techniques; yet the hon. Gentleman knows that at the end of the day, the subjective
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0064">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
interview has not been made redundant, that it is in the interview—the face-to-face confrontation with the applicant—that frequently the decisions are made.<br><br>
My hon. Friend was saying that even if one manages to remove 99.9 per cent. of the uncertainty—and it may come more often than we are led to believe—where someone who is selecting is confronted with a range of applicants who appear almost perfectly to meet the specification, he still has the dreadful task of making a choice of applicant. There is no point in dodging the issue. That X factor comes into play, and I hope that the provisions of the Bill will remove that X factor in terms of it being a person's religious denomination. As my right hon. Friend has suggested, the tragedy is that frequently many make the decision that the X factor will not be a religious factor, but it will be construed as a religious factor when an appeal is made against his decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again we are having a repeat of the academic argument that we had on Clause 2. Why is this legislation necessary? It is necessary because one section of the community in Northern Ireland, the Roman Catholics, have felt for about 50 years that they were being victimised and discriminated against by Protestant employers.<br><br>
When a person applies for a job there is no difference in the employer's mind between Socinians and Free Presbyterians. It might be interesting to know how the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) was able to ascertain that there were so many Socinians in Northern Ireland, as evidenced by the last census, but a person would not be given a job or refused a job because he was not a Socinian or a Free Presbyterian.<br><br>
What has been happening in the past in Northern Ireland is that if the Socinian lived in the Shankill Road he got the job, if he lived in the Falls Road, he did not get it. That is what it is all about in Northern Ireland. It is not the religion of the applicant which counts. It is the result of the questions asked by his prospective employers during the interviews, or his academic qualifications and the school he attended. It is on the sort of politics he has. Does he believe in a United Ireland? Is he a Socialist? Does he believe in the maintenance of the link with the United Kingdom?
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
Does he support the Orange Order? It is the attitudes which determine whether the man gets the job—not the Church he does or does not attend on Sunday.<br><br>
We in Northern Ireland know the necessity for this legislation. The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) made rather heavy weather of bringing before the Committee a hypothetical case of three applicants for a job, one of them getting the job because he seemed to be more capable of doing that job.<br><br>
This legislation is necessary because there are firms in Northern Ireland. One of them employs nearly 10,000 workers, of whom 200 are Catholics and 9,800 Protestants. Another firm employs 1,600 workers, of whom 1,560 are Protestants and 40 are Catholics. I do not want to name the firms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not stop now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is why the Government felt this legislation to be necessary.<br><br>
Again, in what would be referred to as nationalist areas in Northern Ireland, undoubtedly there is evidence that there may be a firm with a majority of Catholics and a minority of Protestants, but the agency would be taking into consideration the political climate in those areas, and the population, and whether there was a majority of Protestants or Catholics. The fact that there may be a majority of employees following one religion does not necessarily mean that that firm is indulging in discrimination.<br><br>
The Belfast shipyard—this is a case which everyone can take, and there is no contradiction—employs over 9,000 people, and I am not sure whether there are even 200 Catholics employed. Many of the jobs in the Belfast shipyard are for labourers and unskilled workers. No academic qualification is necessary for those jobs, as was rightly said by the right hon. Member for Down, South. One would think that with such a lot of unemployment affecting both communities, particularly in such an area as that which I represent—Ballymurphy—where 48 per cent. of the male population are employed in this particular area of West Belfast, someone from Ballymurphy would have a labourer's job in the shipyard—a floor sweeper, say—but he does not. In fact, in the anti-unionist or non-unionist areas of that constituency, very few people have jobs in the Belfast
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0065">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 107</span>
shipyard. Perhaps the shipyard is not engaging in discrimination. Perhaps it has an "old boy network" operating, but an outsider considering the total figures would be driven to the conclusion that something more than qualification is sought from an applicant for employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has fairly pointed out that there are circumstances in which an imbalance results from causes other than discrimination. Does he feel that that aspect is allowed for in the definition clause with which we are dealing? In particular, would he or the Minister say whether the words "in those circumstances" would enable the agency to have regard to the sort of extraneous factors to which the hon. Gentleman has rightly drawn attention?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for the Minister, but I am confident that when he replies, he will say that the agency will be able to take all those circumstances into consideration. I would hope that the agency being set up by the Government will be manned by responsible people, that they will not be people who deliberately go out of their way to find an employer against whom they can take some action. This provision is meant to do away with discrimination, not to take action against an employer unnecessarily.<br><br>
The whole protection in the Bill is to abolish discrimination. The people who are appointed to the agency will be responsible people and they would be able to take into consideration all the circumstances—the geographical location of the factory, the political complexion of the neighbourhood and everything else—which would determine whether an employer was practising discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I refer to a point which has already been raised in Standing Committee and also on Second Reading in the House and in the other place? That is the reconciliation between Clause 1(1) and Clause 16.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) has properly made clear his view that that discrimination is not always one way. He also referred to nationalist areas and to anti-unionist and non-unionist sectors, bringing out the point that the question of discrimination and equality of opportunity is to some extent religious in character—if one can call it religious—and to some extent political.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 108</span>
The Under-Secretary of State, referring to something which was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave), said in the Second Reading debate:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill is concerned with religious discrimination. Clause 3 makes discrimination on the grounds of religious belief unlawful. However, because of the connection in Northern Ireland between political and religious beliefs, the Bill must also cover political discrimination, otherwise a person could say that he was discriminating only on political grounds when he was in fact practising religious discrimination. The Bill provides that it is no defence to religious inequality to say that discrimination is on political grounds."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 16th February 1976; Vol. 905, c. 1063.]</p></blockquote>
I am not the only member of the Committee who wonders why the discrimination on political grounds should be outlawed in the Bill, but that the Bill should not also provide positively for equality of opportunity on political as well as religious grounds.<br><br>
I suspect there is a good reason for that. There has been some discussion of this matter already, but I think it would be helpful if the Minister of State or the Under-Secretary, when replying to the debate, would put clearly on record why there appears to be a conflict between Clause 1(1) and Clause 16, in which discrimination is defined.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme:</span><span class='membercontribution'> I think this clause, like Clauses 1 and 2, is central and fundamental to the Bill. I listened with great care to the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) when he dealt with this X factor.<br><br>
His hon. Friend also challenged my hon. Friend about the basis of how people are selected for jobs and what modern methods are used. I assume that the same methods are used in Northern Ireland as are used in Great Britain. Employers assess ability, experience and, as the right hon. Gentleman says, they assess whether a person is thrustful and, if it is a sales job, whether he can sell an article. All these factors are taken into account, but the one factor that is different in Northern Ireland is the religious one. It is this factor that is not taken into account in Great Britain, but which is unfortunately taken into account in Northern Ireland; that is the reason for this Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 109</span>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
We have, therefore, to take this clause on that basis. When the right hon. Gentleman talked about due allowance, due allowance must be made for all the factors I have been talking about, but in the end a person should not be discriminated against because he happens to be a Roman Catholic or a Protestant. I do not see that it helps a great deal to go into religious denominations. There is a divided community in Northern Ireland; that is the reality of the situation, and I regret it. I see it in practice, and representations have been made to me about alleged discrimination. I receive as many complaints from the majority community as from the minority community.<br><br>
I would say to my hon. Friend that there is no argument about it: this Bill will operate in an even-handed manner across Northern Ireland. If there is discrimination which is outside the terms of the Bill, in the sense that it goes against its principles, it will be dealt with, whether it comes from nationalist or unionist areas. As for the point about the political matter raised by the hon. Members for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) and Armagh (Mr. McCusker), Part II will take account of this. It is unnecessary to deal with the political discrimination in Clause 3, because Part II and Clause 16 will take care of it. The clause we are discussing sets out factors of which an employer may take account. The definition is in terms of the result to be achieved rather than the grounds of individual acts.<br><br>
I come to the right hon. Gentleman's hypothetical point. That result is equality of opportunity between persons of different religious beliefs, and it will not be open to an employer to defend his failure to provide such equality on the basis that he acted on the grounds of political opinion. This is why it is essential in Parts I and II to refer separately to the issues of political and religious discrimination as such.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not really understand what the right hon. Gentleman says. I must be very obtuse. He says that it is not necessary. Would there be any harm if Clause 3(1) read:
<br><blockquote><p>"In this Act 'equality of opportunity' means equality of opportunity between persons of different and political beliefs"?</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 110</span>
Would it make any nonsense of the Bill? Would it not make things a little more clear?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the purpose of the Bill is to promote equality of opportunity on the basis as stated in subsection (1) of this clause. In achieving that equality of opportunity, the two facts must be taken, as it were, together and are taken by the Bill in Part I and Part II.<br><br>
In this clause we are dealing with the basis of religious discrimination, and we shall come to the other part in Part II. The point with which we are dealing clarifies what this clause stands for and what equality of opportunity stands for. There has been a great deal of logic chopping by the right hon. Gentleman, as illustrated by his hypothetical case this morning. My hon. Friend mentioned something about discrimination and how selections were made in the armed forces. I witnessed discrimination. If I may say so, there are many people in this Committee this morning who could exchange stories about Her Majesty's Forces. I remember compulsory church parades and all that went with them. We are not dealing here with how the right hon. Gentleman was made a colonel—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A brigadier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A brigadier—I beg pardon. I was only a warrant officer bomber navigator. We will not go into that this morning. We were discussing whether or not other factors could be taken into account. The agency can have regard to factors which are material to the job. Therefore, these factors are material to the job.<br><br>
I come to the central point of the right hon. Gentleman's hypothetical interview. I think that the right hon. Gentleman is of the opinion that this agency will be a naive body which will not look at the overall factors. It will not merely decide at one plant between one person and another. The agency will be concerned with the overall policy and, through the assessment that it makes, it may want to examine the possibility that certain firms, for many years, have been practising discrimination. Thus when firms select candidates, it may be possible for the agency to ascertain on what basis those candidates were selected—whether or not, as my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0067">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 111</span>
Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) said, there is available employment within adjacent areas which could be called upon in times of labour shortage or when jobs are available as such.<br><br>
There may be other areas where, by their very nature, there are no jobs available for the people of one community; but firms must be able, if they are challenged, to prove that they are not discriminating on the basis of religion or political opinion, but are taking into account the purpose of this Bill.<br><br>
I therefore urge the Committee to accept the clause. We shall be coming to how the agency investigates and remedies certain practices in Clauses 12 and 13. We shall be coming to Clause 16 relatively soon, when these other factors can be raised, but I can say to the right hon. Gentleman that, from the Government's point of view, the clause is an important factor in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that anyone could have listened to the Minister's reply and still be under the illusion that the Committee is wasting its time in looking very carefully at the implications of this definition. I should like to pay a tribute to the Government Whip for letting his hon. Friends off the leash. Less capable operators sometimes attempt to muzzle hon. Members on their own side. The hon. Gentleman is not making that mistake. This is very beneficial to the Committee because the contributions from both the hon. Members for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) and for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) emphasised real problems, about which we ought to be more satisfied before we part with the Bill. I shall, if I may, take them in that order.<br><br>
Like the Minister of State, I do not want to be sidetracked—indeed, Mr. Crawshaw, if I were, you would quickly order me back on to the parade ground—into the military experience of hon. Members. Suffice it to say—and I do not say this for the first time—that in the early years of the war I personally found that the officers occupying the staff positions, the Grades GSO1 and GSO2, were, taken as a whole, the most capable body of men with whom I have ever had to act in any walk of life. I should be sorry, therefore, if the idea were diffused that the selection processes by which men were selected for staff training and higher command in the pre-World War 2 British
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 112</span>
Army, had failed to elicit and improve a great deal of the available talent.<br><br>
The importance of the contribution of the hon. Member for Selly Oak is that it brought out dramatically that the consequence of this Bill—and the inevitable attempt which firms will have to make to have something to say when they are accused of having discriminated upon religious grounds—will be to foster a whole new industry. Perhaps we should welcome it as a contribution to full employment in Northern Ireland, but woe betide the firm that cannot produce the advice of an industrial psychologist for the questionnaire, and the boxes which have to be ticked and the forms which have to be completed by applicants. We shall certainly give a boost, by this Bill, to the industry of industrial psychology in Northern Ireland, because all employers will have to equip themselves with an alibi. <i>[Interruption.]</i>I am coming later to one or two questions which I have to ask about the applicability of this Bill in other fields. I may come a little nearer home even than the hon. Member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Litterick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the essential point being made by the right hon. Gentleman that the Bill will, I fully expect, prompt the development of professional personnel management in Northern Ireland. It is not a new industry. It is called professional personnel management. That is all, and that is to the good.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, I accept that there will have to be—genuine or bogus—methods adopted in order to show, as it were, a clean bill of health. But what will happen—and my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) who has practical experience as a personnel manager will bear this out—is that at the end of that process, too, someone will take the responsibility on his own hunch for appointing A and not B. Otherwise what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) is saying is that in future people will be appointed by a computer procedure. They will be appointed on a points system drawn up by industrial psychologists. It will be a question whether it is 96 or 97 points that will decide whether A or B fills a particular post. I do not believe that to enforce in this way—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman allow me? It is inconceivable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0068">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 113</span>
that the agency would come to an opinion such as he is stating, based on an isolated case. It is based on the overall principle in the operation of industry in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But if the right hon. Gentleman looks at the clause, he will see that the definition of equality of opportunity applies, as it must apply, to persons. It is dealing with the appointment of a person to a job and all the other circumstances, which are attachments of one individual in front of another, are made out in the succeeding subsections. The inquisitions which the agency will have to conduct to accumulate a series of individual cases so as to draw its view on trends—quite apart from what we shall come to later in the Bill, where equality of opportunity is directly applied to individuals under the guise of discrimination—will mean that where previously management's decisions would have been taken honestly and genuinely without any consideration of religious beliefs, there will be a growing system of cover-up. There will be the means of providing a pretext and a machinery which will neutralise the invitation this clause affords to the agency to investigate, since there will be cases of appeal under this part of the Bill relating to individual equality.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is probably the individual case that would prove whether there has been consistent discrimination in a firm. If there was one isolated instance, the agency would not go running after it if it knew that the work practice at that firm had been on an even-handed basis on the past.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for agreeing that in the end, when the terminology of this clause comes to be appraised and legally considered, it will be in an individual case and on the question why A was appointed rather than B when we perfectly well know that A and B are of different religions. For myself I must say that I believe that in the end, regardless of industry psychology and the accumulated lore of personnel management, a great many appointments, the more important ones especially, will be made upon the indefinable and unjusticiable judgment of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 114</span>
those who will bear the responsibility for the consequences of whether A or B has the job. I do not know whether the Bill applies to appointments in the Northern Ireland Office. I suppose it will be so small that it may come below the minimum exemptions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I answer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will apply to the right hon. Gentleman's appointment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. Do not be silly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not being silly, because the selection of the right hon. Gentleman was presumably made with a view to his aptitude or otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary for State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. J. D. Concannon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The best man for the job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The best man for the job. We have been hearing from the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) that that sort of thing is out of date—the old-fashioned rule of thumb where one looks at a man who is known to all concerned and says "He is just the man to be Minister of State in the Northern Ireland Office". This should be introduced first in Downing Street and in Whitehall instead of hon. Members being promoted to the Whips' Office, made Parliamentary Secretaries and given Cabinet appointments simply on a hunch, something which the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak despised. No, it will not be like that in future. We are told that it should not be like that in future. There should be a perfectly impersonal computerised procedure and all the members of a party will be put through it. They may be subjected to psychological tests. They may go before a board of psychologists who will have defined the job of the right hon. Gentleman and who will have worked out the exact psychological aptitude.<br><br>
It so happens that in this case, as we all know, hunches have as good an effect as would have been achieved by the most refined procedures. I am afraid the hon. Member for Selly Oak has implanted an anxiety in our minds which will take a long time to eradicate.<br><br>
I turn to the point raised jointly by the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) and myself and which the right hon. Gentleman did not settle. The hon. Member for Belfast, West said that we all
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0069">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 115</span>
know there are circumstances in which, although there is a gross statistical imbalance between religious beliefs in employment, there are reasons for that other than discrimination on the part of the employer. It may be the composition of the population in the area. It may be the danger for certain persons of traversing areas in order to reach their employment. It may be tradition or a whole range of causes which have nothing to do with discrimination on grounds of religion.<br><br>
When the right hon. Gentleman was asked by the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) how that would be dealt with, he first appealed to the assertion that political belief has also to be taken into account in Part II of the Bill. He distinctly said—and he repeated it several times and referred to Clauses 1, 2 and 3 of the Bill—that in considering whether there was equality of opportunity, political opinion would be brought into the matter.<br><br>
I have failed to find any reference to political opinion in Part II of the Bill and cannot but conclude that it has been deliberately left out. Therefore, the point which the hon. Member for Belfast, West and I were making, rather jocularly in the case of the Socinian from the Falls Road—we all know the genuineness of what he was saying—is not covered by Part II of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I perhaps correct the record? I said "Part II", but I meant Part III. I apologise to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, because we were misled and puzzled. We therefore have the fact that where equality of opportunity and the procedures under Part II are concerned, we shall not be able to pray in aid anything but religious belief as here defined.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for Belfast, West that that will lead to some grotesque results. He and I then combined to ask the right hon. Gentleman how the agency would be able to take into account the other sorts of circumstances such as I have mentioned in judging employment in a particular case. I fail to read this subsection as though the circumstances therein referred to were the kind of circumstances which are bothering the hon. Member and myself.<br><br>
On the contrary, if we apply subsection (2) to one of those cases, say, to the case of a factory in a predominantly Protestant area, access to which is threatened for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 116</span>
those coming from another and different religious area, it seems that if one construes subsection (2) in those circumstances the agency would be obliged to ignore those circumstances. It says, where the other person has an opportunity "in those circumstances", then the complainant—as I will inaccurately call him—ought to have the same opportunity in those circumstances. So, to the best of my understanding the definition of equality of opportunity is so drawn as deliberately to exclude a great part of reality as we know it in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I conclude by saying this. Once again in the Minister of State's reply we returned to this divergence between purpose and method. I repeat, our purpose in debating this clause, in seeking to vary its effect, is not to make it easier or in any way to condone discrimination upon the basis of religious belief. Our purpose is to ascertain whether the attempt to apply these provisions will lead to so much debate, so much misunderstanding, so much sense of unreasonableness, so much sense of unreality, that it will, in practice, have the opposite effect.<br><br>
I say candidly to the right hon. Gentleman that I think this debate on clause stand part has thrown up real difficulties. The wording of this clause is so tightly drawn that it will invite these problems which will have nothing to do with the prevention of religious discrimination. I say also that the Minister ought very seriously to study with his advisers the points which have been raised this morning. We share with him the object, and we fear that, as it stands the clause will be an irritant rather than a solvent.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We come here to the appeals board for the purposes of Part II of the Bill. I would particularly draw the attention of the Committee to the words "by this Part", in line 31, which make it quite clear that it is only appeals concerned with the activities of the agency
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0070">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 117</span>
under Part II which will go to the Fair Employment Appeals Board.<br><br>
I wish to query whether it is necessary for the purposes of Part II to set up a completely separate quasi-judicial body. After all, if we look at the procedure in Part III — the sharp end of the Bill, if I might so describe it, dealing with the prevention of unlawful discrimination, what happens, roughly, is that the agency takes a view. Having taken a view, it proceeds, if it thinks fit, to act upon that view. But if the person proceeded against—I do not think my terminology is quite accurate, but I will be understood by the Committee—disagrees, he can go to the county court as set out in Clauses 28 onwards. Then the county court, the normal court of law, has to address itself to all the questions which we have been considering in the context of Clause 3, and those which are raised by the provisions of the Bill in Part III.<br><br>
What my hon. Friends and I question is why there should be this separate machinery for Part II. I take it for granted that there is no disposition on the Government's part to institute additional machinery for the sake of instituting it. After all, goodness knows, we have boards enough without looking for ways of setting up a new board. Although I recognise that this board is limited in its personnel, that it will be a judicial, rather than an administrative board, that it will not be an active and interfering body, as we fear the agency will be, nevertheless the question must be faced: "If the courts of law are good enough to decide whether discrimination has taken place under Part III, why are they not good enough to decide whether the facts on which the agency is purporting to act under Part II, can be fairly made out?"<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
We should not, and here I think that I carry the whole of the Committee with me, set up para-judicial bodies. We have too many "para" bodies in Northern Ireland as it is, without having a para-judicial body. Unless there is an overwhelming necessity to set up, side by side with the courts of the land, para-judicial bodies for performing special purposes limited to one part of one statute, we should not do so.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 118</span>
The right hon. Gentleman and I will recall from an earlier Parliament, the activities of the para-judicial body—and I hope I do no wrong in calling it that —which was set up under the Industrial Relations Act 1971. I had occasion, as he did, to criticise it severely. I think that we both felt that it was unfortunate that the existing judicial and statutory procedures, if there had to be any, were not used. Against that same background, I put this question, with the same presumptions that I put my question to him this morning. Is it really necessary for Part II alone to go through all of the business of establishing a separate appeals board when appeals under Part III and the remainder of the Bill can be perfectly well dealt with without any such additional machinery? I hope that we will hear a convincing reason, if there is one, before we agree to this clause being added to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that in many respects we are trying, in this Bill, to work on a voluntary basis as far as possible. As the hon. Gentleman has rightly pointed out, the functions of the appeals board arise under Clause 8 in connection with the register of equal opportunity, and under Clause 14, which deals with the appeals procedure against directions given by the agency.<br><br>
The difference between Part II and Part III is that in Part III the appeals will be against the findings of the agency of unlawful discrimination. In that respect, these will be heard by the courts. Under Part II, however, an appeal will be made to the board, rather than to a court, because a review of the directions can be termed to be balancing different policy considerations rather than applying the law to determine facts. Nevertheless, due to the discussions on the Bill in the other place, the Bill now provides that at least one member of the board shall be as barrister or a solicitor of not less than seven years' standing. Again, this is purely for advisory purposes, when the board is set up. The other two members of the board, we hope, will be from both sides of industry—an employer and an employee.<br><br>
The effect of this clause, therefore, is purely advisory. It is basically to keep matters voluntary and to make sure that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0071">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 119</span>
they are kept out of the courts if at all possible. I am sure that all of us who have been in the House of Commons over the past 10 years would wish that to be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Airey Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find some difficulty about this, arising from what the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) said. The Minister has told us that an appeal to the county court, under Clause 28(1) as I understand it, would be a question of the application of law rather than a determination of facts. In both cases, appeals to the appeals board or to the courts would involve questions of fact and law. There is no real distinction here. Obviously there will be a lot of complication in having two sets of appeals procedure—one to the appeals board and one under Clause 28, which we shall come to later on, to the county court against the agency's finding, on complaint, of unlawful discrimination. I do not think that that distinction should be made. It is more a question of determining the facts in the first case and applying the law in the second. Both cases must be questions of law. There is a difficulty in having two sets of appeal bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say that, like the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave), my anxieties have not yet, at any rate, been laid to rest by the Under-Secretary —least of all by his reference to the appeals board—and this may have been unintentional—as advisory.<br><br>
I hope that it is regarded as having a judicial function and not—The hon. Member for Abingdon dissents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I was agreeing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. If there is a justification for the appeals board, it is to keep questions of policy—leaving them to the agency—apart from questions of establishing fact in relation to the law—leaving them to the board or perhaps, as some might prefer, to the courts. But I cannot go with the Under-Secretary when he draws the sharp distinction between the sort of questions which will be appealable under Part II and Part II. For instance Clause 8(1)(<i>a</i>) enables an appeal to be made to the appeals board by a declarant aggrieved by the removal of his name from the register under Clause 7(2)(<i>b</i>)(iii).<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 120</span>
On looking at Clause 7(2)(<i>b</i>)(iii) we find that the agency may say that he has:
<br><blockquote><p>"… acted in a manner inconsistent with adhering to the Declaration;"</p></blockquote>
For example, it says "you discriminated under Clause 3 in not providing equal opportunity to our Socinian friend as compared with our Roman Catholic friend." He says "No, I did not. The agency is wrong. It is finding unjustly and wrongly against me. Therefore I appeal against its decision."<br><br>
It appears to me that there is no difference between the subject matter of that appeal under Clause 8, and the appeals which Part III of the Bill rightly direct will go to the courts. I am sure that the Under-Secretary would not suggest that because there will be a lawyer on the appeals board, that is sufficient reason for an additional and different body to exercise judgment in the same kind of case.<br><br>
What would be alarming, and I think that it is the reason why my hon. Friends and I query this clause—would be if the criteria which are to be applied by the appeals board are different from the criteria which would be applied by the courts. I have no wish to anticipate a consideration of the activities of the agency, to which we will come in subsequent clauses. I only say that if the agency does not have power of life and death over a firm, at least the Bill gives it power of advantage and disadvantage. Where, for example, a firm is largely dependent upon Government contracts, it will virtually be in the power of the agency to put that firm out of business by its findings under Part II of the Bill. We shall be considering this in greater detail later. I do not know whether the Minister is assenting to my proposition. We shall have to wait until later to see whether I am mistaken. I will simply say that I read the Bill as intending to give the agency powers of advantaging firms whom it considers provide equality of opportunity and disadvantaging firms whom it considers do not do so.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has fallen into the same difficulty as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0072">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 121</span>
Benjamin Disraeli when he unintentionally made his maiden speech in the House. He was getting up to go out when the Speaker called him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is too anxious to have me intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to accept the gentle imputation from the right hon. Gentleman that his interventions are so helpful to the work of the Committee, and sometimes so helpful to my argument, that while I do not in any way stimulate them I am always very happy to see them rising to the surface; I thought that this was one of those occasions.<br><br>
I revert to the simple point that under Part II the citizen may be disadvantaged in his property and his business affairs by decisions of the agency arising from interpretations of specific cases, and that, if the citizen wishes to challenge that interpretation and therefore that consequence, he ought as properly to have access to a court of law under Part II as he does under Part III.<br><br>
May I add this last plea to the Under-Secretary? My hon. Friends and I want to see this Bill do as little mischief as possible, and if it is in its power to do any good we are happy that it should do so. We therefore wish to query anything in the Bill which will give rise to misapprehension and to opinions, even unjustified opinions, that the agency is misconceiving the situation and is interfering when no interference is justified. The establishment of a separate appeals board to deal with the subject matter of Part II strengthens our fears. I shall ask the Under-Secretary, if he replies again, to acknowledge the serious points which are being made and to consider—it certainly would be a streamlining of the Bill—whether it is necessary to have Clause 4 and Schedule 2 in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I continue to share some of the right hon. Gentleman's apprehension about Clause 4 and the existence of two appeal bodies. He must be right in saying that the appeals board set up under Clause 4 is a judicial body and that the appeal to the county court under Clause 28 must be based on questions of law. Whether there is religious discrimination may be a question of law on the facts of a particular case. The Under-Secretary should deal with this point,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 122</span>
because he rather gave the impression that in some way the appeals board would have fewer judicial powers. It is, of course, a quasi-judicial body, as the right hon. Gentleman said. I think our minds should be set at rest on this point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I gave that impression, I have obviously been put right by the hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) and the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave). The appeals board is, of course, not purely advisory. Its decisions do have legal effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is very important. It could not be advisory—an appeals board is not advisory. It must be judicial in some form or another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have just pointed out that the board's decisions have legal effect. It is not purely advisory. But there is a distinction between Part II and Part III. Under Part II the point at issue is whether the directions issued by the agency are reasonable in all the circumstances. The whole point about the agency is, of course, that it tries to deal with matters on a voluntary basis— putting issues, say to firms and individuals. It has to act in a reasonable way in all the circumstances. This is purely a question of a different attitude toward the legal issues of unlawful discrimination in Part III.<br><br>
There are, of course, many aspects. I think quite a lot of us share fears of some kind about appeal boards such as that set up by the industrial injuries legislation. This board will look at particular issues without having to go to court, and to a great extent its decisions are to be accepted. What we are saying is that there is a difference between Part II and Part III. That difference lies in looking at the decisions taken by the agency and making sure that they are reasonable in all the circumstances. What is in Part III is purely legal definition of unlawful discrimination. This is the basic difference, as we see it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am still not satisfied about this. The legal definition of unlawful discrimination must apply to both courts of appeal. It is a question of law under Clause 3 whether there has been discrimination on the facts presented to the appeals board. When the Under-Secretary says that the board is advisory, he cannot
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0073">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 123</span>
be right in any sense. No appeals board can be advisory in the sense that he is saying. Therefore, there is no real distinction here between the functions of the two appeals courts. I think that the Minister of State will be wise to read through our proceedings later, and then decide whether there is not considerable force in our arguments. There will be great confusion for employers and others in appealing on the various grounds provided in Clause 4 and Part III. Both are questions of law, in fact, and we should bear this very much in mind.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Under-Secretary responds—as I think he must—to the point just made by the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave), may I point out that there is nothing particularly unique about Clause 14(2) to which the Under-Secretary referred. I appreciate that in Clause 14(2) the appeals board is considering whether the directions given by the agency to the appellant have been in all the circumstances reasonable, and I quite agree that the appeals board has to exercise a judgment—something which is very far from an advisory activity and very far from being unknown to courts of law, many of which are constantly interpreting what is reasonable or not for a person to be required to do.<br><br>
But if the Under-Secretary looks at Clause 30, unless I am mistaken he will find that it gives the county court the right to substitute different recommended action for the action recommended for the agency with the purpose of eliminating discrimination. In other words, in Clause 30 we accept that the county court is a proper body to look at all the circumstances and say "We do, indeed, find that there has been some discrimination, but, looking at the circumstances, we think that the agency has been mistaken in the sort of directions it has given, and we are going to draft different recommendations and directions and substitute them for those of the agency."<br><br>
I submit that there is no difference in kind between the activity of the county court under Clause 30 and the activity of the appeals board under Clause 14, more especially as in Clause 14 the case will have had to be established upon the examination, as was previously agreed, of individual instances.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 124</span>
I hope, therefore, that the Under-Secretary and his advisers will take this point very seriously. There is a difference from the point of view of the public and that of employers whether they have an appeal to the courts. I am not saying that appeal to the courts is a resort which the citizens enjoys making, but the courts give him a confidence which no other body is capable of giving him. Therefore, employers who read that not only will there be an agency set up, but also an appeals board, different from a court of law, which will have one barrister on it—and, no doubt, the other two people will be perfectly admirable individuals—will be bound to ask why they cannot go to a court if they think the law is being misinterpreted or misapplied by the agency. I ask the Government to see whether they cannot give this reassurance and simplify the Bill; they might even save a little money on the way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to do a little better this time, because it is obvious from what has been said by the Opposition that they are a little woolly about the provisions in the Bill. The function of the appeal body in Part II is to hear appeals against the opinions of the agency and its directions to remedy the apparent failure to provide equality of opportunity. The appeals under Parts II and III are against unlawful discrimination. Clearly, from what has been said from the Opposition Benches, we shall consider very carefully the views put forward without saying that we could or would alter it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. It seems that these amendments are rather different. Whereas Amendments No. 18 and 19 appear to be of much the same kind, Amendment No. 17 is on a very different subject.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I felt that it was suitable to group them together, I do not think the Committee is at a disadvantage by my so doing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison). If it would be of any help, I think he will find that in moving my amendment, the anxieties which I shall be expressing about the background to the drafting of the guide and recommendations will not be unallied with the proposals, which also commend themselves to my hon. Friends and myself, which he and the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) are making in their amendments.<br><br>
This clause is concerned with the issue by the right hon. Gentleman's Department of a guide to good manpower policy and practice. I will not at this stage dilate upon the question whether we need another such document. I am sure that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) will be able to recommend a whole library of such documents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Litterick</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have his confirmation, so we are in for a treat later. We shall be able to consider later whether we need such a guide. The guide incidentally is to contain recommendations as to policies and practices which, if adopted, would promote equality of opportunity.<br><br>
I think it is necessary to look at what the guide is to be before we decide who ought to be consulted about it, but to that extent that part of the guide represents the Department's unofficial and unbinding but nevertheless clearly important interpretation of Clause 3 and Part II of the Bill generally. It will be for those in the Department in compiling that part of the guide to struggle with some of the difficulties which have detained the Committee this morning for an hour and a half without arriving, it must be admitted, at a perfect resolution. So be it. If Clause 5 is to stand part of the Bill, we shall have from the right hon. Gentleman's Depart-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 126</span>
ment yet another guide to good manpower policy and practice.<br><br>
We have to consider, since this is being made a statutory obligation, and since it is being made a statutory obligation to consult Lord Feather and company, why he should have the special privilege of statutory consultation for the drawing up of the new glossy when others are so conspicuously omitted. What is there about the present work and the present state of mind of the Advisory Commission on Human Rights which makes it uniquely qualified, apart from the agency, to advise the Department of Manpower Services what to put into its guide?<br><br>
There was published yesterday, I think, a working paper of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Perhaps members of the Committee have not yet had the leisure to study it, but what came out from a cursory examination of that document was that it had by no means made up its mind, but was still betwixt and between, in mid-stream, on the major remit which it had received in the 1973 Act which brought it into existence.<br><br>
Why should an advisory commission, which is in the middle of its work under the 1973 Act, albeit a standing commission, be given this unique statutory canonisation as adviser-in-chief to the Department of Manpower Services on the compilation of guides to good manpower policy and practice? I think there is in this something almost offensive to others who have just as good a right to an opinion in that unique situation.<br><br>
There are two ways in which we could approach this. Perhaps it was characteristic of my hon. Friends and even of myself that with that direct approach which characterises Northern Ireland Members and also with that desire for economy of expression—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Litterick</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are joking.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes—economy of expression. After all, the points I have put before the Committee have been deployed in the minimum space possible. Perhaps that has cost the time of the Committee, because it was necessary, in discussing Clause 4 stand part, for the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) and myself to go over the ground three times before the Under-Secretary understood what we were driving at. I am pre-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0075">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 127</span>
pared to accept that there are disadvantages in excessive concision in expounding a case in Standing Committee. There may be disadvantages—although I think they are outweighed by the advantages—in brevity and omission in case of doubt in the drafting of a statute.<br><br>
As I say, we have the alternative of whether we should take out this extraordinary special case of the standing advisory commission which is the proposal of my hon. Friends, or whether we should add in a list of other people who have at least as good a right, if not better, to be consulted upon the compilation of what I have been guilty of describing as "the new glossy".<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
This is very much a matter for the Committee to decide, but I have moved the amendment so that we can hear from the Government what is the reason for the unique distinction which he is conferring here upon the standing advisory commission and so that we can consider, if the subsection is to be amended, how it should be remedied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I will not be accused of excessive concision if I deal shortly with Amendment No. 18. My hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) will speak to Amendment No. 19.<br><br>
It seems strange that the only body which the Department has a duty to consult should be the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Having had some association with the work of that body, which I applaud, I none the less feel that it is extraordinary that in a Bill which seeks to promote equality of opportunity between people of different religious beliefs through the individual firms, the employers and employees should not be consulted as a matter of duty. This, of course, is before the publication of a guide to good manpower policy or recommendations as some hon. Gentlemen would suggest.<br><br>
A guide to good manpower policy could not be prepared without consultation. It would be in the interests of good will and the working of this Bill if representatives of employers and of the unions were included. I am glad to see the right hon. Gentleman nodding his head. They are the people most involved in this Bill. They will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 128</span>
have to take action in their own premises and works to prevent unlawful discrimination. They will have to attend training courses and conferences—a matter about which we had some debate a few days ago. Much as I regret that particular paraphernalia to be added to the Bill and the functions of the agency, I think the employers and unions should be consulted.<br><br>
On Clause 1 we heard a good deal about the opinion of industry in Northern Ireland, and there were various opinions about what it actually was. What is not in dispute is that good will, as well as compliance with the law, will be required if the Bill is to change attitudes among both employers and employees. Therefore, I hope I have used proper economy of expression in referring to Amendment No. 18.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is indeed strange, as both the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) and my hon. Friend have said, that Lord Feather's Committee should be singled out, unless the reason is that in its annual report for 1974–75 that committee devoted Chapter 4 to the Bill which we are discussing. I think that it would be better not to specify any body working in this field, than to mention only one.<br><br>
Amendment No. 19 enables attention to be drawn to the overlapping scope of the proposed agency with the functions that are most admirably performed in the regional sphere by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and locally by the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints.<br><br>
In discussions about whether a Bill of this kind is necessary at all, I have heard it suggested that the ombudsman could be enabled to do the work proposed to be done by the agency in the Bill. It is this which makes it more necessary that the agency, in compiling a guide to good manpower policy and practice, should be in close communication with Mr. Justice McGonagle, or whoever it is, and that the function of the agency should be clearly defined in relation to the functions now being performed by the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Commissioner for Complaints.<br><br>
It is a little surprising that we have not yet heard much about that from the Minister. In one of the two Reports on Northern Ireland for 1974, the Parliamen-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0076">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 129</span>
tary Commissioner for Administration said in paragraph 12:
<br><blockquote><p>"Four of the complaints which I investigated related to applications which complainants had made unsuccessfully for posts or for promotions in the Department of Agriculture's Technical Inspectorate. In one of these cases the complainant stated that out of nine promotion posts in the particular category with which he was concerned only one had been given to a Roman Catholic. However, my investigation did not disclose any evidence of religious discrimination."</p></blockquote>
That is presumably the sort of matter which would fall within the purview of the Fair Employment Agency.<br><br>
If we turn to the Annual Report of the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints for 1974, we find that one of the cases which was inquired into was a complaint against the Western Health and Social Services Board concerning the appointment of a clerical officer. Here again, the complaint was of an allegation of discrimination on religious grounds.<br><br>
In dealing with that complaint, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints actually used the magic words "employment patterns" which is reminiscent of paragraph 118 of the Report of the Working Party, so ably chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee). It refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"Findings of patterns and trends of employment, indicating practices with discriminatory effects".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to suggest that these
<br><blockquote><p>"could well form the grounds for the institution of programmes of affirmative action."</p></blockquote>
I therefore invite the Minister favourably to consider the amendment and, in so doing, to tell us how he envisages the relationship between the agency and the Parliamentary and local Commissioners. To whom would he expect someone to resort who believes he is discriminated against in employment by a public authority? Would the dividing line be that which separates the public from the private sector?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I believe that the intent which is illustrated in this clause gives an indication of what the Bill is all about. The Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights in Northern Ireland is a body which was set up under this Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the previous Government.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 130</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The last one. Its very name indicates that it is intent on enhancing the human rights available to everyone in Northern Ireland. As such, after the length of time it has existed, and the number of people whom the Commission has met—undoubtedly it has had discussions with employers and with the responsible trade union movement in Northern Ireland—if it has been of any value, it must be aware to some extent of the problems that have existed in Northern Ireland for so long.<br><br>
If its function is, as I accept it to be, the enhancing of human rights for everyone in Northern Ireland, I cannot see any valid reason for objecting to its inclusion in the list of organisations which are to be consulted by the Minister.<br><br>
Also the clause states that the Minister can have discussions and consultations with other people as he thinks fit. I take it that it will not preclude discussions with the CBI. Certainly the Minister has given previous indication that he is willing to consult with any responsible body of persons in Northern Ireland to see how this legislation can be made effective and in the interests of all those who feel, rightly or wrongly, that in the past they have been the victims of discrimination.<br><br>
What valid objection could there be against the inclusion of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights? It may be that Lord Feather was appointed by the Labour Government, or it may be that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Speaking for myself and my hon. Friends, we are not opposing the inclusion of it, but we are saying that we do not think that this Standing Commission should be—as suggested by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell)—canonised in relation to other bodies. What it is necessary to include are those people who are most directly affected—the employers and the unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any attempt by my right hon. Friend to canonise any particular organisation. But, as I have said, the <i>raison d'être</i> for the existence of this organisation leads one to believe that they have had consultations with various bodies in Northern Ireland and that they are concerned about human rights.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0077">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 131</span>
The same cannot be said for the CBI, because it is not its function to employ its energies in ascertaining whether human rights are being done away with. The function of the CBI, the function of employers, is to make profits and to keep their members in business. But the reason for the Standing Commission on Human Rights is entirely different, to inquire into why a person has been victimised and to see whether anything can be done to enhance their human rights and, consequently, their way of living.<br><br>
I repeat that perhaps some hostility is being generated—and one can take it by the hon. Gentleman's intervention—by the fact that this Commission is headed by Lord Feather, who has had a distinguished career in the trade union movement. The fact that the hon. Gentleman a few moments ago mentioned the CBI seems to indicate—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I expressed no hostility to Lord Feather and the Standing Commission on Human Rights. I applauded his work, with which in the past I have had a good deal to do. I was saying that we should include, as a statutory requirement, consultations with employers and unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not precluded by the wording of the clause, which says that the Minister is prepared to have discussions with other persons as he thinks fit. Knowing the calibre of my hon. Friend and the way that this has been appreciated in Northern Ireland, I have no doubt that he will invite the agency to have discussions with everyone involved, anyone who can contribute to enhancing human rights in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I have less support for the amendment spoken to by the right hon. Gentleman, namely, that which proposes that we should include the Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints in Northern Ireland. I have known him for many years and he is carrying out his present duties in a most distinguished way. But I have always believed that the Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints in Northern Ireland is the final arbiter, the person to whom one goes at the very end of the road, after having exhausted all other means.<br><br>
It would be invidious if the inclusion of the Parliamentary Commissioner were to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 132</span>
mean that he would be in consultation with the Advisory Commission and that he would, therefore, be part of whatever decision was arrived at. Later on a person might feel aggrieved about something and would have to take an appeal to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the hon. Member who, as always, is speaking so eloquently, happens to have read the clause, which is concerned with the Department consulting bodies about the content of a guide. He appeared at times to be under the impression that it was a question of the agency consulting—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then the hon. Gentleman has been misreported.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole question of manpower policy is involved, and directions, instructions and advice will be given to people covered by this clause. But if the Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints is involved in decisions before such things are issued or guidelines are laid down, and eventually someone feels aggrieved and takes an appeal to him, it seems that that person may not have the same faith in a decision given by the Parliamentary Commissioner as he would be if the Parliamentary Commissioner had remained over and above any discussions which were initially understood.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is probably my fault. I did go a little wide, as I wanted the Committee to hear something about the relationship between the agency and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints. But we are discussing a guide to good manpower policy and, surely from the cases that I have cited, it should be clear that the Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has experience in the field of complaints of discrimination in employment. It is not a question of putting anybody above anybody else. It is simply a question of obtaining advice from those with great experience of such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, as the hon. Gentleman has said, it is not a question of putting anybody above anyone else. If we were so minded, we could list scores of names of people and organisations who should be consulted.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 133</span>
At the moment the Advisory Commission on Human Rights seems to have an unassailable case for being included in the consultations. There is no restriction or disqualification on anyone else in Northern Ireland with whom the Minister thinks he can have fruitful discussions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend allow me to clarify a pointless conflict between the Parliamentary Commissioner and cases of religious discrimination? If he will turn to Clause 58(2)(<i>b</i>), he will see that all cases of religious discrimination will be excluded from the Parliamentary Commissioner, in the sense that the cases will go through the agency and through this Bill. Therefore, there will not be a conflict of interest in the manner in which my hon. Friend feared. I hope that explanation clarifies the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole point about Amendment No. 17 is that the hon. Gentleman, by the effect of his amendment, would leave out the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, and that we would not have to consult the Advisory Commission itself. In effect, I think that the Advisory Commission has taken an active interest in this Bill and it has a statutory duty under the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 to advise on the effectiveness of the law in preventing discrimination on general political opinions or religious beliefs, and in providing redress for personal grievance of discrimination. From that standpoint, in itself, it would be odd if we did not consult the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Not to make consultation obligatory would be a reflection on the usefulness and on the hard and diligent work of the Advisory Commission.<br><br>
I turn to Amendment No. 18. This clause reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"…after consultation with the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, the Agency and such other persons as it thinks fit …"</p></blockquote>
I am entirely in agreement with the sentiments put forward by the hon. Gentleman. An assurance was given in the other place on Second Reading. We give similar assurance, also, that the Department will consult:
<br><blockquote><p>"representatives of employers and employees".</p></blockquote>
Consultation with those people will be included.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 134</span>
We find that Amendment No. 19 is unnecessary for the reasons that my hon. Friend has just given. It seeks to include the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Commissioner for Complaints with the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights and the agency as bodies whom the Department of Manpower Services must consult in preparing the guide to good manpower policy and practice.<br><br>
In reality, both the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Commissioner and the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints are <i>ex officio</i> members of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights and, as such, are already included among those persons whom the Department must consult in this matter. Therefore, we see their specific inclusion as unnecessary. I should like to add, however, that we see a great deal of merit in the argument and should like to look at this again. If the hon. Gentleman would be kind enough to withdraw his amendments, we will look at them in a form of acceptance of Amendment 18, and to see whether it is necessary to write in the Parliamentary Commission and the Commissioner for Complaints on Amendment 19.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I explained, the difficulties which my hon. Friends and I feel over the unique reference to the Standing Advisory Commission would be considerably diminished if Amendment No. 18 were made. Although I understand why the Under-Secretary wishes to take time to consider whether anything on the lines of Amendment No. 19 is necessary and, if so, how it should be dealt with, I see no reason why Amendment No. 18 should not have been accepted straight out and written into the Bill.<br><br>
I therefore propose, with the permission of the Committee, to withdraw Amendment No. 17 so that we can secure the admission of Amendment No. 18 to the Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The next Amendment is No. 18, in the name of the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave):<br><br>
In page 3, line 40, after "Rights", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"representatives of employers and employees".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On Amendment 18, we—</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 135</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but we have ended the debate on Amendment No. 17. Amendment No. 18 is an amendment which was not moved, but which is about to be formally moved, after which I am afraid that I must put it to the Committee. It can be accepted or rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can it not be withdrawn?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 are, in fact, not before the Committee until they are moved formally when we reach them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what you say about the proper order in this case, Mr. Crawshaw. With regard to Amendment No. 18, we must have an undertaking that there will be the specific obligation included in the Bill to consult the persons referred to in Clause 18—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do, but it is not within my power to allow it. The debate is finished on the amendment proper. The hon. Gentleman who is to move it formally may wish me to put it to a vote, but we cannot have another discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I might be able to do something if I could finish my sentence. If there were a specific obligation, my hon. Friends and I would be prepared not to press this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a nodding agreement that there is an undertaking by the Government, in which case the amendment is not moved.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whilst we have accepted during the debate so far that other clauses were central and essential to the Bill, that argument could not be made for this clause. We would argue that under Clause 2, if the Committee had not been so restricted, the duties which are now being conferred upon the Department and the agency could have been adequately covered by Clause 2. In many ways, our amendment was another attempt to reduce the wordiness of the Bill. It was in no way intended to diminish those who would be involved in the discussions, but rather to tidy up the Bill and to vest some confidence in the Department and in the agency.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
When one witnesses the spelling out in Clause 2 of what is required of the agency, and then when one witnesses the spelling out in Clause 5 of the additional bodies that must be consulted, one cannot help but feel that the underlying suspicion in Northern Ireland of the people —even before they are appointed—who will be part of this agency, emerges because we are binding them around with qualifications and are specifying in great detail what they must do.<br><br>
Is it being suggested to this Committee that if it is essential to have a manpower policy, one must say to the Department and to the agency, "In compiling this policy or this guide, you must consult with A, B, C, D and E."? Would we not accept that if, as the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) said earlier, we must man the agency with responsible people, the personnel involved in the implementation of this Bill must be the type of person we hope will, of their own volition, have consulted the Commission on Human Rights?<br><br>
The Department would obviously consult their own child—the agency—and such persons can include anyone—the CBI, the ICTU, the British Institute of Management, the Institute of Personnel Management and so on. When one witnesses how strictly we are trying to tie down and spell out what is expected of these bodies, one cannot help but feel that at the back of one's mind there is a suspicion that the motivation of these people may be suspect, that their authority may be suspect, and so let us make sure that they write it all down so that we get certain things done.<br><br>
I cannot help but wonder what the Department of Manpower Services—that is its title—has been doing for the last two years. Is the Minister who is responsible for that Department suggesting that it does not have a manpower policy and that it does not guide and advise companies on manpower policy, or is he suggesting that the policy that it has at present is not all it should be, or that it is not selling it on the basis that it should be. That is my first query.<br><br>
When one reads Chapter 8 in the report and recommendations, one sees spelt out on page 20 the reasons why it is thought necessary to have a guide to manpower policy. In the first place, they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0080">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
would make it more difficult for attitudes of prejudice and intolerance to find expression in practice and, secondly, they would help to produce the unfair treatment which results from ineptitude and thoughtlessness rather than wilful bias. If anyone believes that an already inept and thoughtless personnel department or manager responsible for recruitment for a particular company will somehow be converted by a guide one day being pushed through the letterbox, then he is fooling himself.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
I accept that their two objectives are well worth striving for, and some form of guide might well be worth producing. On pages 21 and 22 the report goes on to specify in detail the sort of things which the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) would find in all the other documents and books he has already suggested. It says for example,
<br><blockquote><p>"Properly validated and standardised tests can help to implement non-discriminatory personnel policies … The company should publicise its policy on equal employment opportunity as widely as possible … Careful attention should be given to short-listing and interviewing procedures to ensure that these are fair … Those responsible for the engagement of staff should document the reasons for the rejection of all unsuitable applicants",</p></blockquote>
and so on.<br><br>
I suggest that, after producing this manpower policy and meeting all those detailed requirements, we shall be back to the point where we shall find ourselves time and again in the Committee —the X factor. We shall be back to the situation where irrespective of the tests used, what techniques are employed, what policy one has, what declaration one signs at the end of the day, frequently, and more often than not, our recruitment agent—be he a personnel manager, a training officer or whatever—is confronted with the problem of the selection of three people. Whereas that manpower policy may ensure his right to choose applicants, it will not take from him that unenviable duty of having to decide who is the most suitable applicant, and will not protect him when the unsuitable applicant, decides to cry "Discrimination!"<br><br>
I have been in the situation, as I am sure all of us have been, where I have not been successful in applying for a posi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
tion. Somehow, the first thing that springs to one's mind is not that one was not the best applicant; one does not automatically think that one was not the best person for the job. Normally, one is convinced that one was the best person, so there must be another reason, and with the best manpower policies in the world, with the best tests in the world, we shall still have that aggrieved person believing that he was rejected for some other reason.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend implied earlier that he did not think too highly of personnel practices and procedures. I hope he did not mean that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would go along with the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) in that these require highly developed skills, which are essential to modern industry. I am sure the Minister will bear me out that in Northern Ireland on a <i>pro rata</i> basis with Great Britain, most companies have professional personnel managers. I am talking about companies of a size which can afford them. If one examines the activities of industrial training boards, one finds evidence of their success in persuading companies to set up personnel training offices, properly manned and staffed. They are assisted financially sometimes, but they are there. Staff are attending courses on personnel management to implement the various skills which the hon. Member for Selly Oak was advocating.<br><br>
But I am pleased that the Government are supported by the Report because it does not say that properly validated and standardised tests will eliminate the discrimination. If properly validated and standardised tests can help, that is as far as we can go.<br><br>
I conclude by asking whether it is necessary always to spell out what we expect of this agency. Is it right to try to tie it down in this detail? Having agreed that a guide of some description is necessary, do we have to say "Now you have it, you must take the necessary steps to publicise it"? Is it necessary to tell the Department of Manpower Services, when it has agreed this guide, after widespread discussion throughout Northern Ireland, that it had better not keep it in the top drawer but make sure to distribute it?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0081">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
When I think of a guide, I think of a "glossy", as my right hon. Friend has said. I do not like the idea of compulsion being placed upon the Department and the agency to produce quickly this glossy guide, which will then be the bible upon which manpower policy is based. In our amendments and our thinking on this clause, we were hopeful that we could have brought about the situation where the Department and the agency in consultation could, as their various activities developed, come up with recommendations which could be circularised. In the fullness of time, these might well have been described as a composite guide. The idea of producing a guide puts the Department and the agency under time-factor pressure with which we disagree. We regret the inclusion of this clause; we feel that all that is being said in it could have been adequately covered in Clause 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with much of what my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) has said. It must be restated that whilst we accept that the Advisory Commission on Human Rights would be rightly concerned to encourage fairness in the selection of employees, we cannot see how it could be more confident than some of the bodies which have been mentioned in contributions during the course of the debate to compile in detail an appreciation and analysis of the alleged difficulties and then go on to supply a detailed contribution to the whole policy of good manpower. We therefore align ourselves with those who have suggested that this advisory commission ought not to be given a privileged place.<br><br>
The second point I should like to make is that this elaborate guide to good manpower is unnecessary, because it will be changed and amended so frequently that it would be better published by way of simple recommendations than by an elaborate production, a so-called guide to good manpower policy. May I draw attention to the points made by my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend, who stressed the fact that it is naive to believe that simple, terse definitions such as are to be found in Part II of the Bill are adequate to meet complex situations. We conclude that such is the Government's obsession to categorise people that they will press on with these simple, terse definitions which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
will be totally incapable of meeting the complex questions and situations which will arise but cannot at this stage be anticipated and defined in detail. Because of this, the guide to good manpower will find itself obsolete and irrelevant in the light of those ensuing difficulties.<br><br>
May I illustrate this point briefly? How do we guide employers in ascertaining what is a due allowance or a material difference? These matters evidence themselves in an impromptu manner which cannot be covered by pre-prepared guides and legislation. Therefore, we are saying that a guide will be both irrelevant and costly, and we should not give the Advisory Commission on Human Rights a privileged place in this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see no reason why the Under-Secretary with reasonable concision should not be able to deal with the clause before we rise this morning. However, there is one point to which I should be grateful if he would address himself. I take it that there is no reason why, without this clause, the Department should not be able to do all the things contained in it. There is nothing to stop the Department from producing .a "glossy" or from making recommendations. Indeed, I trust they do that from time to time anyway.<br><br>
The remainder of the clause follows by common sense. I therefore query whether it is wise to write into a Bill as an obligation what a Department may in any case do, because, in interpreting the law—and this will ultimately have to be interpreted by the courts—the question will arise as to why this was a statutory obligation unless it was in some way to be binding.<br><br>
What causes me anxiety—and perhaps it should also cause the Government anxiety in relation to the activities of the agency—is the fact that we are to have, in the terms of a recommendation, the Department's view on what is the agency's work. The fact that these recommendations are made statutorily and have to be made, will inevitably result in their being regarded as binding in any case before the courts.<br><br>
I do not think that that is desirable, and it is certainly not necessary. I feel that in this respect the Government would have been wise to leave in the relevant chapter in the report of the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0082">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) as part of his report and not have endeavoured to make it a clause in a statute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First let me say that if on Amendment No. 18 there was any misunderstanding, I thought that I had cleared it by asking the Committee to agree to our tabling a relevant amendment later.<br><br>
On the clause itself, the Committee have missed the point. What we have said is
<br><blockquote><p>"… and such other persons as it thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
That means that consultations could and will, by the obligations we have placed, be as wide as possible, and the guide will be published only after the very fullest discussions with and advice from all the interested parties in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
This clause is one aspect of the Bill which is designed to promote equality of opportunity through voluntary means. The purpose of the guide is to help employers and others establish practices which are conducive to equality of opportunity. However—and this perhaps meets the hon. Gentleman's point—there will be no compulsion to follow the guide, and failure to do so will not in itself incur the risk of legal proceedings. What we are doing with the widest consultation with those involved with Northern Ireland, is to evolve a guide to practice which will suit all the people.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The key words are those which the Minister has just used—"… will not in itself …" be binding. The reason for our anxiety is that this statutory guide, which will in no way ever be submitted to the House, is bound to be taken into account and regarded as having authority—(<i>Interruption</i>). In that case, if the hon. Gentleman demurs, I must beg leave to doubt the wisdom of having this done by statute at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, that is what we are saying. This is a guide, and I am saying that the agency may take it into consideration, but it will incur no legal proceedings.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I raise, on a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw, the fact that one of the Committee Room clocks is running slow, which is most dangerous to the prosecution of the Committee's work. Perhaps you will give instructions for that to be put right?</span></p>
