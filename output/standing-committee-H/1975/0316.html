	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>FAIR EMPLOYMENT (NORTHERN IRELAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our last sitting the Committee agreed that Clause 6, as amended, should stand part of the Bill. Is it desired that any of the amendments to Clause 7 which have already been discussed, should be moved separately?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to ask your permission, Mrs. Jeger, to move one of them formally. First, however, may I raise a point of order concerning the working of the Committee. I have a practical suggestion which I hope will help hon. Members. May I say, Mrs. Jeger, at the beginning of this morning's proceedings without incurring your censure, that we are very sorry that your affliction is still upon you, and that I am sure that we shall endeavour to keep of our own accord, so far as possible, within the rules of order so as to place the least possible strain upon your vocal organs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the present difficulty in obtaining Amendment Papers hon. Members who apply as usual at the Vote Office are told that the Amendment Papers will be available in the Committee Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, at 10 o'clock, on being given that information in the Vote Office. I arrived in this room at five minutes past ten to find the Amendment Papers for the Committee being distributed. This means that most hon. Members would have to come here in order to get their Papers and then go about such necessary matters as they may have to attend to in the compressed time before the Committee sits at 10.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion which I should be grateful if you would examine, Mrs. Jeger, in the proper quarters between this sitting and the next, is whether it would be possible at the same time as the Amendment Papers become available in the Committee Rooms—and I am sure we all realise the burden which is being placed
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
on certain staff by the duplication and distribution—for a certain number—it would not need to be many—to be placed in the Vote Office so that hon. Members coming in through the Members' Lobby could pick them up without having to come upstairs and then go downstairs again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for raising so small a matter, but as you will be aware, Mrs. Jeger, time is very precious in the half an hour before Standing Committees sit, and I am sure we should be grateful if you would be good enough to look into this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman. That was certainly a fair point, and I will see whether there is any way in which we can help. However, one of the problems is that only a limited number of photostat copies are made and that is why distribution is being concentrated in the Committee Rooms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as this morning's business is concerned, I can assure the Committee that there is nothing new on today's Amendment Paper. There are no Amendments that were not seen previously on the Paper. It might be helpful if hon. Members would hold on to today's Papers for future reference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Jeger. There should be no difficulty in having copies put in the Vote Office. There will not be an enormous demand for the Amendments. It is very much a special interest matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a different point of order, Mrs. Jeger. May I seek your guidance with regard to Divisions in this Committee. At our previous sitting the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) carefully asked the Chair to confirm the time of day, which was said by the Chair to be 12.29 p.m., and he made reference to a pairing arrangement that he had made. Can I obtain some clarification from you, Mrs. Jeger, as to what your practice is likely to be when it is necessary to call a Division? What period of time will you normally allow to elapse before the doors are locked? Could you hazard a guess at what time, subsequent to a Division being called, the roll would actually be called in the Committee Room itself?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you and other members of the Committee will appreciate, if there is a pairing arrangement at 12.30 and a Division is called at 12.29, when the door is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
locked, it is not only impossible to get into the room, but obviously it is equally difficult to get out of the room if the door is locked. It would be helpful to have on record how long you would normally allow to elapse and what might be your guess as to what time the roll is actually called following the announcement of a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. He must not in any way involve me in pairing arrangements, which are not for the Chair. For telling the time, I always go by the figures on the right-hand side of the television screen which I can see more directly than by a sideways look at the clock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the time which elapses before the doors are locked, that is entirely within the discretion of the Chair. If the hon. Gentleman wants me to put a figure to it, about two minutes is normal. According to Standing Orders, it is merely to allow Members who are outside the Committee Room to come inside. It is not intended to allow for long journeys.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulties at our last sitting, but I hope that I have been helpful to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Jeger. It will be within the recollection of hon. Members—and this may assuage the feelings of the hon. Gentleman—that on that occasion you allowed a rather exceptionally long time to intervene. I remember noticing the degree of patience which you were exercising. While it is within your discretion, I think it will be within the recollection of hon. Members that on that occasion, perhaps in view of certain circumstances, you exercised your discretion with great wisdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make it clear that there is no implied criticism of the Chair whatsoever in this matter. I was merely seeking to clarify the position and have it put on record. In reply to what the right hon. Gentleman said, there are no feelings to assuage because I have expressed none in the matter. I have merely sought information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
	<p>What I want to have clearly on the record, which might be considered by Committee Room by a particular time and of the House, is that, although the Chair cannot be involved in pairing arrangements, it is none the less accepted that for whatever reason—whether it be pairing arrangements or other commitments within the House—there may be a situation in which a Member has to leave either the Chamber of the House of Commons or a Committee room by a particular time and may have arranged to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is necessary to leave the Chamber of the House, it is generally possible to do so in the course of the Division, because the waiting time is considerable. But when a Division is called in a Committee one is not merely locked out of the room; one can be locked inside the room. If a Member is to be confined in the room for several minutes, and he has another commitment, it is impossible to accept that position of being locked in if one is to meet that other commitment. I wanted to have that on record, and I hope that the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) will ponder the matter.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret the hon. Gentleman's predicament. It was because I wished to be meticulously fair about the pairing arrangement we made that I tried correctly to establish the time, because the pairing starts at a particular time. If the pair has not started, there is no pair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we should get on. I wish only to say that if hon. Members are locked in, they are not compelled to vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question gives us an opportunity to proceed further in our examination of the kind of machinery set up as a result of the register of persons subscribing the declaration, which is instituted under the previous Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee starts this investigation under an advantage compared with its proceedings last Thursday, because in a sudden accession of enlightenment last Thursday the Committee decided, very wisely—and I hope that the Government will take advantage of it—that it would eliminate Schedule 3 from the Bill. We are therefore exempt from considering the special difficulties which have been caused for enforcement by the wording and contents of that Schedule which many of us found objectionable. As a result of the omission of subsection (3) of Clause 6 we shall be relieved of the unpleasant necessity at a later stage of going again through the distasteful details of that Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing I say depends upon the impropriety or otherwise, or the desirability or otherwise, of the wording which will eventually be adopted for the declaration in Clause 6. I say only that I hope that without grudge or rancour—and I am sure that both qualities are foreign to the characters of the two Ministers on the Committee—the Minister will take this opportunity to reconsider the content of the declaration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Clause 7 we come for the first time to the manner in which the register of declarants will be used for the purposes of pressure, persuasion or compulsion at whatever point in the scale one might assess it. I want to draw attention to what, in our view, is a faulty approach in the Bill as it now stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could make this most clear by directing the Committee's attention to subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>), which says that the agency shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"remove from the register the name of any declarant who … has declared that he no longer adheres to the Declaration"</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that if anything was plain-sailing, that provision was. In subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>)(iii) the clause goes on to say that if the agency concludes that the person is, in its view, breaking the declaration, the agency has the power to follow a procedure laid down in Clauses 12 and 24, and Clause 8, in the matter of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
This again is perfectly straightforward. It is a perfectly intelligible and controllable piece of machinery that, having got the register of those who have made the declaration, the agency should use its power to remove from that register the trigger which detonates its investigation and its policing—if I may use that rough expression—activities; and those policing activities are, in the terms of the Bill, properly subject to both statutory provisions set out in Clauses 12 and 24 with the appropriate Schedules, and also the right of appeal in the Clause to which we are presently coming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit to the Committee that there is no need to institute another procedure, side by side with that, subject to no sort of appeal and liable to the suspicion—of which I am sure that the agency would not be guilty—of harassment and unreasonable behaviour. That is the ground set out in subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>)(i).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read this Clause in conjunction with Clause 8, there is no appeal procedure, and none of the statutory machinery of the Bill applies under sub-paragraph (i), so that the power of the agency stated in paragraph (	<i>a</i>)—to require a reaffirmation—is unrestricted. So far as I can see, Clause 8 is deliberately so drawn that action by the agency under subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>)(i) of this Clause would not attract the safeguards or the appeal. There may be some way in which they are attracted, and no doubt the Minister will draw the Committee's attention to it, but the broad proposition that I put to the Committee is that having got an appeals procedure and being about to institute a statutory-controlled form of investigation by the agency, we should not short-circuit it and allow the agency to use its power under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) as a direct means of bringing duress to bear on declarants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be no misunderstanding in the Committee that my hon. Friends and I naturally consider that if a person makes a declaration, he should be held to its terms, and there should be means of proceeding to deal with him if he is shown not to have conformed to its terms. Whether a register is the best method of doing so, I would not, at this stage, argue because we have added Clause 6 to the Bill. I would argue, however, that enforcement, however gentle it is and however subtle the persuasion, should be subject to statutory safeguards
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
and to the right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Clause stands, if one looks at paragraph (	<i>a</i>), one can see the power of the agency to require reaffirmation
	<br><blockquote><p>"… at such intervals and in such manner as the Agency may determine …"</p></blockquote>
Read in the light of paragraph (	<i>b</i>), this appears to give the agency an unrestricted power without giving reasons, and without cause shown, to come down on a declarant suddenly on a Monday morning and say that to remain on the register, he must reaffirm his declaration. In those circumstances, the declarant should have all the rights and the agency should have all the duties which are attracted by subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>)(iii) and Clause 8. Therefore it is wrong that the reaffirmation procedure should be separated from the investigatory and appeal procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, what I am saying to the Minister is that he is losing nothing—nothing, certainly, that he ought to want—if he only allows the agency to remove from the register under the terms of paragraphs (	<i>b</i>)(	<i>ii</i>) and (	<i>b</i>)(	<i>iii</i>). I am sure the hon. Gentleman would agree that it is quite unreasonable for the agency to come down upon a declarant with the clear implication that he is in breach of the declaration, otherwise why ask him to reaffirm it? That is the clear implication, that the agency should be able to come down on the declarant without having investigated the matter and consequently without his having the grounds of appeal provided in Clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am on this point, perhaps I might invite whichever of the Ministers is to reply to clarify subsection (2). There is no question here of reopening matters discussed on a previous Amendment, but on "Clause 7 stand part" the Committee is entitled to more clarification than it has yet had as to the meaning of subsection (2). I am not now arguing, as I was previously, that subsection (2) (	<i>a</i>) should be removed but I am asking that its meaning should be made clearer to the Committee than it has hitherto.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context, I refer to the remarks of the Under-Secretary at our last sitting. His attention was drawn to the words in line 39, page 4 "in such manner", when it was pointed out that those words are quite at large, or appear to be quite at large, and that, whereas the Bill prescribes—or used to prescribe, at any rate—a particular form of declaration, it is left to the agency to devise for itself any form it likes of
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
reaffirmation, however onerous or however undesirable it might seem. Having gone to the trouble to debate and discuss what ought to be the proper form of an initial declaration, it seems quite wrong that the form of a reaffirmation should be left at large. If that is so, we were wasting our time and shall perhaps in future be wasting our time in giving a statutory form to the declaration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of that debate the Under-Secretary was asked whether the words "such manner" would or would not include the administration of an oath by the agent. I have read his words again very carefully, but his reply was not explicit and I think that the Committee should know one way or the other before we part with this Clause. I asked the Under-Secretary
	<br><blockquote><p>"Would they or would they not … include 'on oath'?"</p></blockquote>
He replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"They could".</p></blockquote>
I think that caused considerable surprise, indeed, some dismay in the Committee, so much so that the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) took up the point and asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the agency can require a person to take an oath?"</p></blockquote>
To which the Under-Secretary replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this will depend upon the agency, which, of course, has the duty, according to the Bill, to use its common sense and practice to good effect."</p></blockquote>
I wish that the wording of the Bill was as plain, intelligible and commonsensical as the hon. Gentleman succeeded in making it, but then he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It could not require the employees"—</p></blockquote>
I think he meant the declarants—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to take an oath which would have effect in a court of law … But a great deal of latitude will be given to the agency".—OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee H,</i> 11th March 1976; c. 173–174.</p></blockquote>
This point should be cleared up, because it will cause some irritation and misunderstanding if declarants think "If we sign this declaration that will not be the end of the matter. It will be possible for the agency, without cause shown under subsection (2)(b)(	<i>i</i>), not to have a general renewal of oaths or affirmations after one or two years, but to come to our firm in particular if they do not like the colour of our eyes"—a thought put into my mind by the remarks last Thursday of the Under-Secretary—"and invite us to reaffirm"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend said last week was right, but the Government have looked at the situation, and if the right hon. Gentleman meant a legal oath, or that an oath would be taken, the straight answer to that is "No."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the right hon. Gentleman intervened. I think that we have achieved something, in that we can put it on record—and it will no doubt become known to those who will be working this procedure if the Bill goes through, and to those who are deciding whether or not to sign the declaration—that, in practice, it is not in the contemplation of the Government that the agency would in any formal way seek to put declarants more upon their honour than the declaration itself does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his gestures of assent, because I tried to formulate the last sentence or two in precise form. Having the affirmation of the Minister of State, that can go out and will, I hope, give some satisfaction and reassurance to potential declarants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we shall expect before we part with the Clause is that the Under-Secretary will give us a further indication of what lies behind subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>); that he will give us more indication of what he would regard as a commonsensical occasion for the agency to require a reaffirmation; and that he will undertake to consider whether he needs subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>)(i) at all, and whether it would not be of advantage to his Bill and to the advantage of what we are all aiming for, whether or not we agree with the way in which the Bill seeks to do it, to be able to say to employers "If you sign this declaration, there will be no question of its being used against you, except by means of procedures which have been laid down in the Statute by Act of Parliament and which are subject to a right of appeal on your part." I think that that would give the declaration a much better chance of voluntary acceptance than it has as the Clause is, and as the explanation for the Clause stands at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My anxieties about the Clause were expressed largely in my intervention last Thursday on Amendment No. 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee knows, we on this side are in general support of the Bill. I am glad of the clarification by the Minister of State, in his intervention in the speech of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), of the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) as to whether or not reaffirmation under subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>) would be on oath. We now understand that it would not be on legal oath, but perhaps we could have further clarification of what kind of oath, pledge or promise is envisaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had clarified this point. If we are talking about an oath in the ultimate definition, there is a legal oath that is taken and which would stand up in a court of law. I want to make it absolutely clear that an oath will not be asked for, either legal or otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be obliged for that very clear statement by the Minister of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attitude to the clause as a whole must depend on a reply being given to the request I made to the Under-Secretary of State. At the foot of column 176 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of our Fourth Sitting, he will find a slight misprint. Instead of "schedules" I said "schedule", referring to Schedule 3. I suggested that because of the difficulty I found in the Schedule he might wish to consider having it redrafted before Report. To that there was no reply, but I hope that we may yet have a reply, because the arguments already advanced and yet to be advanced have force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last week the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) said, in defending this part of the Bill, that employers in Northern Ireland should be queuing up to sign the Declaration. One can perhaps understand that approach, but one is tempted to ask whether that would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
be desirable. Would it not be embarrassing? If one is to believe all that he has told us, and all that Labour Members have implied, it would be extremely embarrassing to have every employer in Northern Ireland lined up at the door of the office to sign the Declaration on its first day of issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inference was that employers should be doing that. I am trying to see the practical difficulties that would occur if they did. We are confronted immediately with the question of who can sign the Declaration immediately—if "immediately" is the right word—and when it can be signed if not immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 6 states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As soon as reasonably practicable after the commencement of this Act … employers … organisations of workers"</p></blockquote>
will be invited to sign and encourage their members to sign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that the CBI and the ICTU will sign the Declaration immediately the Bill becomes law. They have already indicated that in their report, and their names were inserted in the draft. They will not therefore have any problem studying what the Declaration says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that Harland and Wolff is a member of the CBI. On the basis of what we have been told in Committee during the past three weeks, could it go along immediately on the first day and sign the Declaration? The Boilermakers' Union is an affiliated member of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. On the basis of what we have been told, could that union sign the Declaration on the first day?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the practical questions we must ask ourselves. Is it not better that some form of investigation is undertaken, no matter how rudimentary, before the Declaration is signed as to whether or not they will be allowed to sign? Will ICI, Courtaulds and Du Pont, three companies with impeccable records with regard to their policy and practice, be allowed to sign? Will Harland and Wolff, Short Brothers and Harland, the ropeworks, or Hughes Kennedy Bakery not be allowed to sign? Would it not be better in some respects that applicants should be required to submit a notification of their intention so that some investigation as to their current practices could take place before they append their name to this document?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would go so far as to say that it would be extremely unlikely that a company should be allowed to sign this Declaration
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
unless it has seen this good guide to manpower policy. It needs to study that document to see whether its current manpower policy is in line with it. Perhaps when it does that, an indication of a desire to sign could be notified to the Agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is harking back rather to Clause 6. We should keep more closely to this Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am looking at the portion which deals with the Agency keeping the register and its power to fix the form and rectify it and to remove names and add names. If the Agency will be empowered to remove names from the register, it is important that such names are not allowed to be appended to it in the first place if it is likely that they will be removed. Investigations should take place before that occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enthusiastic companies, acting as the hon. Member for Belfast, West has said, could queue up on the first day to be first to sign the Declaration. They may currently be using policies and practices which they feel, in all sincerity, are legitimate and genuine, and which may entitle them to sign the Declaration. However, another part of the Bill indicates that unintentional discrimination can be construed as intentional discrimination, and that company could later be investigated and, on the basis of a head count, be indicted for discrimination, even though it may not have thought that it was practising discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to give an indication to companies and to the Agency that a system will be set up which will avoid names being appended to the Declaration and included in the register, which on subsequent investigation, for whatever reason, may be found not to comply and which will then be removed. I hope that the Minister will say that he does not want people queuing up on the first day to sign the Declaration, and that a procedure will be implemented to avoid the embarrassing situation which I suggest will occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to follow the latest argument of the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker). He has constantly argued against the principle of intent and everything else, and now he says that I must make sure that no one goes along to sign the Declaration, or words to that effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0119">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>207</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly the impression that the hon. Gentleman gave me and, I think, my hon. Friends. If I have misunderstood him, I apologise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kernel of the Clause, was accepted but for two points which have exercised the minds of hon. Gentlemen opposite. The first concerned the oath, which we have now had a chance to look at and put right. That is now perfectly understood. The second point made was on appeals under subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no right of appeal to the individual, as the Clause stands, when the Agency removes his name from the register because he has failed to adhere to the Declaration as required by subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>). This is because it was considered that removal would be almost automatic in such circumstances and there would be no room for appeal. After listening to the arguments this morning, however, I think that the right of appeal is arguable. If it will help the Committee to make progress, I need not say more than that we will consider the point which the hon. Gentleman has put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is indebted to the reasonable response of the Under-Secretary. I would only add, to feed it in, as it were, to his considerations, that we have in mind the case of a declarant who has signed the Declaration in good faith, who genuinely believes that he is, in fact, fulfilling it, and who is then approached by the Agency with a request that he should reaffirm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would not have to be a very unreasonable person in those circumstances to say with or without an oath "I have made my Declaration. My word is my bond. I refuse to reaffirm what I have affirmed and what to the best of my belief I am keeping to." It is therefore onerous to attach the right of appeal only to a case where he succumbs to the blandishment to reaffirm, and then the Agency under paragraph (	<i>c</i>) refuses to comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker), my hon. Friends and I having criticised provisions of the Bill, when we then accept that they have been added to the Bill by a majority in the Committee, must not be accused of inconsistency if we then in subsequent stages of the Bill consider what the consequences of those provsions will be, how they ought to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
amended and how they will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I do not think that we shall make progress the faster for that kind of accusation of inconsistency being levelled across the Committee. It was out of tone with the helpful manner in which the hon. Gentleman replied to the debate and we shall look forward to seeing the results of the Government's reconsideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only comment that the Under-Secretary made on what I said on Thursday and this morning was a sedentary interjection which I could not catch. Do I understand that he is not prepared to look again at Schedule 3, that he is utterly tied to every dot and comma in that particular Declaration? I do not think that he is being particularly considerate or helpful if he is not prepared to consider or reply to what I have ventured to put before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to help the Committee. On Clause 7 I should not have thought strictly that Schedule 3 arose. I shall have to put the Question on Schedule 3 in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert J. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 35, in page 5, line 40, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) has not by-passed an opportunity throughout these proceedings to imply that we are opposed not only to the method of arriving at a particular objective but that we are opposed to the objective to which this Bill would draw the community in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering this Amendment I believe we have an opportunity to underwrite that we agree with the objective of the Bill: that we reject discrimination in employment in Northern Ireland. But paradoxically we do so by apparently strengthening the wording of this clause by introducing Amendment No. 35. However, lest you feel, Mrs. Jeger,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0120">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
that we are giving general consent to the Bill, may I say that we are apparently strengthening the wording but at the same time drawing the attention of the Committee to the all important point that when we expose the general defects of this legislation we are drawing attention to its ludicrous nature—and, indeed, its impotency in many ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to Amendment No. 35 may I ask in what circumstances would the Government envisage the discretionary power to waive recourse to the guide or recommendations? In what circumstances would the Government envisage the waiving of these discretionary powers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we look carefully at the Bill, and the trouble to which, after consulting the Advisory Commission on Human Rights and perhaps many other bodies, the Department is going to produce this guide and recommendations, we ask why the reluctance in some situations to use them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could it be that we shall prove in time the truth embodied in the words of the report produced under the chairmanship of the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee), which states that discrimination in Northern Ireland "exists to some degree"? Is it possible, therefore, that after a lot of work to produce a guide and recommendations, it is discovered that opportunities to use them are to be so limited that the Government now suggest using the words "may have regard" to the recommendations, because there will be situations when the Government will not have recourse to the guide and recommendations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) informed us that already volumes of guides to manpower policy exist, and when one considers that after all the research that will take place and the reduction or, indeed, the simple amalgamation of all these marvellous volumes, there will be instances in which this guide, a result of all that labour, will not be used, some interesting possibilities and reasons emerge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In emphasising that situations may arise in which the guide or recommendations will not be used, I suggest that these particular instances highlight the fact that the Bill exposes a general defect, namely, that it is impossible fairly and consistently to apply the legislation to industry in Northern
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
Ireland. The Government might recognise that situations exist in Northern Ireland which render equality of opportunity impossible at all times and to all persons. That is the exact wording of the Bill, that equal opportunity must be possible and must be applied at all times and to all persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it possible that the Government, by inserting the word "may" instead of the definite word "shall", which we request, are conceding that there are situations which render the offer of equal opportunity at all times and to all persons, totally impossible? I take a hypothetical case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that we have a textile firm in Coalisland, the work force of which is predominantly Roman Catholic, and that two or three specialists are needed to complete a process requiring a certain skill which is not readily available in that area but which could be developed and offered to those who could be trained, although it would take some time to do so. Let us suppose that these vacancies could be filled by Protestants living in the next town, that the owner of the firm decided that he could comply with this legislation, that he could advertise in all the papers, as he would have to, right across the board, offering to transport the workers and to pay them meal allowances, but that in so doing he jeopardised the viability of his firm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What has this to do with the Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is wondering what this has to do with the Amendment. I am coming to the point. The Amendment seeks to remove an absurdity in the Bill. That absurdity lies in the fact that the Government are insisting that there may be situations in which the guide to manpower policy and the recommendations relating to manpower policy may not necessarily be applied in an appeal procedure. I ask the simple question therefore—why? What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are only two possible reasons. First, that consistency with the Bill's terms means that, in certain situations, the future of certain industry in Northern Ireland will be jeopardised. This may be why the Government have inserted the word "may". There will be occasions when they will not be prepared to submit particular firms to the full rigours of this legislation because of special geographical problems and problems of manpower. That is why
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
they have left a way open for themselves. That is whythey have left the options open in this case. The second reason is that by exempting one or two particular firms the great fallacy and lunacy of this legislation is highlighted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the long rambling attack on the Bill to be unintelligible. I am certain that most people in Northern Ireland, particularly the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and intelligent employers when they read the case which has been put forward by the hon. Gentleman will be just as bemused as, I am sure, most Committee members are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member wants consistency, he should advocate that every "may" should be "shall" in this clause—or indeed, throughout the Bill. The clause states that if an employer feels aggrieved that his name has been unjustly taken off the register, he "may" appeal. To follow the hon. Gentleman's logic, if he wants compulsion written into the whole Bill, the employer "shall" appeal—he should appeal. It should not be left to his discretion. He said that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. So if he is trying now to force the Government into substituting the word "shall" for "may", the same conditions should apply to the employer. One would think it only logic if an employer's name was removed by the agency on the grounds that he was not complying with the terms of the declaration which he has signed, and not fulfilling the good manpower policy which is to be evolved after considerable discussion with all responsible parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To hear the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues, one would think that on the day that this legislation becomes law my right hon. Friend will immediately engage in a witch-hunt, and will be looking for employers to make an example of them, and to impose all sorts of penalties upon them. My right hon. Friend, who has had considerable experience in industry, would be the very last to engage in such practices, as that would not bring about what we hope to achieve in Northern Ireland by this legislation. If an employer's name has been removed from the register on the grounds that he is engaged in discriminatory practices, it will only be after the most thorough investigation that this will be done, and if it is proved that he is not engaged in good manpower policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely it would be a very legitimate and acceptable defence of that employer, when
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
he has appealed against the exclusion of his name from the register, to say to the Ministry, "There is your good manpower policy. I have subscribed to it and do not believe that I have contravened it in any way." In any circumstances, that argument would be justifiable and acceptable. The aggrieved employer will have an opportunity, if he avails himself of it, to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would think that a good employer, one interested in having a work staff that is as representative as possible, would avail himself of the opportunity to appeal. If he does not avail himself of the opportunity, the Fair Employment Agency cannot be blamed. If his name is removed from the register on information which is at the disposal of the agency, one would think that it is imperative in his own interests that he should avail himself of the opportunity to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) is unnecessary in these circumstances, because all the available information will first be taken into consideration before the name is taken from the register and the onus will then be on the employer to make his case as cogently as he can before the agency. I do not believe that it is the intention of my right hon. Friend to engage in tactics to make life difficult for employers. The intention of the Bill is to ensure that employers, recognising the divisions that we have had in the labour force in Northern Ireland in the past, now begin to take into consideration the rights of all workers in Northern Ireland irrespective of political persuasion or creed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) has carried the Committee up into regions of imagination inaccessible to those of us who have the use only of opinions of English or, perhaps, also of Welsh logic. It would, indeed, be entertaining—though I am sure that you would check any such propensity, Mrs. Jeger—to contemplate the consequence of making it compulsory upon injured persons to have recourse to the sources available to them under the law for redress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I intervene briefly in order to make it clear that this probing Amendment—and my hon. Friend, the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) made it perfectly clear that it is an inter-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
rogatory Amendment—is directed to a very serious and precise point. First, we are here considering the Appeals Board, not the agency. The question is what the Appeals Board may or may not consider. It says that the Appeals Board may have regard to the document described in Clause 5; but, therefore, presumably it may not. What we want to be clear about is against whom, as it were, this option on the part of the Appeals Board bites. Does it bite against the appellant? Does the appellant come forward and say "Look, here are the recommendations. I have carried out every one of them." In those circumstances, could the Appeals Board say "No, we are not prepared to take account of that. I am sorry. You can take your recommendations away. We are not listening to them. We are concerned with other matters to which those recommendations do not relate"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it may be that the word "may" must be onerous and disadvantageous to the appellant. On the other hand, it may mean—I hesitate to say "shall" mean—that in an appeal the Appeals Board itself can say "We have the alleged facts put in front of us by the agency and by the appellant. Now let us have a look at the recommendations in the guide. Let us take that as our criterion in this case. It has not been pleaded by the declarant and the agency has not alleged that he broke this or that recommendation. Nevertheless, we, the Appeals Board, are going to take it into account." In that case the meaning of "may" will be to the advantage of the appellant. Therefore, we need to be clear about the juridical effect of "may" in this context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that some anxiety is bound to be aroused—and this was voiced by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford)—if, when employers have done their best to comply with what against our advice has been made a statutory document issued by the right hon. Gentleman's Department, they then discover that it is only something to which the Appeals Board may have regard. Therefore, it was natural for those of us reading the Bill to query the word "may". I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will take this point, although it turns upon a monosyllable, very seriously because it turns upon justice done or not done as between the agency and a declarant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know, Mrs. Jeger, that leaving out the word "may" and inserting "shall" is in this House what one might call a beginner's
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
amendment. wherever the tyro discovers the words "the Secretary of State may" he takes up his pen in all good faith and puts in an amendment "leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'". But, of course, that is not the case here. We are dealing with a prescription given not to a Minister responsible to this House, but to an Appeals Board as to how it is to act in a judicial capacity. It therefore behoves us to be very clear in this context why we are choosing permission instead of direction and what the effects of that will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, in order to avoid unduly protracting proceedings at a later stage I might take the opportunity, Mrs. Jeger, to ask another question arising in this subsection to which the amendment relates. It may even turn out to be germane to "may" or "shall". In line 37 the right hon. Gentleman will see that this subsection only relates to appeals under subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>), namely, to appeals against the removal of the name from the register in consequence of what is found by the agency following an investigation under Clause 12. Curiously enough, subsection (3) does not apply when the appeal is against the agency's refusal to restore a name to the register after reaffirmation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have done my best, Mrs. Jeger, but I cannot understand why an appellant whose name the agency is refusing, despite his reaffirmation, to restore to the register should not be able to invite the Appeals Board considering his appeal to have regard to the recommendations of the Department of Manpower Services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not put down an Amendment to leave out those words. Often, as you are aware, Mrs. Jeger, in the study of the Bill in Committee new points arise as one reads it with ever increasing intensity. But I take comfort from the assurance which was given by the Under-Secretary when we parted with Clause 7, which I think if he comes to an affirmative conclusion in his later consideration will result in a certain remoulding of Clause 7 in the context of reaffirmation. It may therefore be that that will reflect upon Clause 8(3) of the Bill and that it will be found that these curious words excluding appeals against reinstatement after reaffirmation from the right to have the recommendations of the Department of Manpower Services considered in the course of the appeal, will be found to be no longer necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I say to the right hon. Gentleman that it may not be necessary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
but this is an extremely serious amendment and it could be a practical amendment in its effect. What we decide on this could prevent quite long-winded and aggravating legal proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) with his customary skill has come, in a sense, to the defence of his hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford), who did not make it clear at all that this was a probing Amendment. In fact, I thought he tried to justify it to the Committee. I think that the right hon. Gentleman earlier referred to consistency, or to the fact that because something had been passed in the Bill previously, the Opposition were quite entitled to make their arguments against it. That is quite correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is germane to the point that if we look at Clause 5(4) we see that where the agency could have regard to the guide the word "may" is there. The right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends did not insert "shall" at that particular stage, so why should the word "shall" now be inserted—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish; then I will give way. Why should the word "shall" now be inserted when we come to the appeals procedure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had an Amendment omitting this in the provision to which the hon. Gentleman has just referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But there was no specific amendment dealing with the word "may". Therefore, I assume that it is not on all fours with this Amendment which we are discussing at the present moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not because "may" applied to an agency is in a different context from "may" applied to an appeals board. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will recognise that when you, Mrs. Jeger, in your wisdom, decided not to select an Amendment which would have removed that word and the rest of the subsection, we are now chided for having overlooked it. Far from having overlooked it, we wanted to get rid of the whole thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that in effect the Amendment was intended merely to delete
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
"may", but we cannot tell whether that is the case because it was proposed to delete the whole subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would inform the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) and the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) that the purpose of having the word "may" as opposed to "shall" is that the guide about which we are talking is a guide, and, as such, there may be factors outside the guide that may be taken into account by the Appeals Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guide is not holy writ. In other words, it does not encompass every aspect that the Appeals Board may want to take into account. We want to be flexible in regard to the operation of the Appeals Board. One would think that because it "may" may not use the guide in making a judgment it will do so judging it against the terms and the operation of the Bill. We therefore feel that the Amendment tends to make the matter mandatory by changing the word "may" to "shall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, that does not even strengthen the Bill if one considers that the Amendment is meant to do so. In fact, it narrows it in a sense, because the guide is, as I said, a guide. I give an example. The health and safety at work provisions have a guide which again is not mandatorily to be used in an assessment, but may be used as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether it would be in order to answer the right hon. Gentleman's question which was outside the terms of the Amendment. I hope that it will help the Committee. He asked about subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) and its implementation. Subsection (3), dealing with past conduct, as to whether the appellant has acted consistently with the Declaration, is relevant only to an appeal under subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>). I hope that that clarifies the right hon. Gentleman's point, and that we can make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is obliged to the right hon. Gentleman. Could I deal with his last point? I take the logic—although I query the result of it—that the matter which is technically before the appeals board in an appeal under subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) is whether the agency was right in its conclusion that the employer was not likely in future to adhere to the declaration. It is wholly unrealistic to suppose that such an appeal could be conducted or determined without regard to his past practice. Surely what such an employer will say is "Look,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0124">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
here are the recommendations of the Department. I have done my best faithfully to carry them out in the past and here is my evidence for it. I will do so in the future. What an unreasonable attitude the appeals board is taking up!"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there is a certain crazy logic about the exclusion of appeals under subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>), when one thinks about the practice of the matter and the questions which will be raised before the appeals board, then whatever is the status—the "may" or "shall" status—of the recommendations, they should apply to all appeals before the appeals board. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will consider that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the intention of my hon. Friends and me to narrow the scope under subsection (3). But we were worried, and to some extent, we remain worried, by the apparent power of the appeals board not to take into account the recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps here I could refer—as did the right hon. Gentleman—to Clause 5(4). It is obviously right for the agency to be able to go beyond the recommendations of the Department of Manpower Services. Indeed, it would be difficult to make sense of the functions of the agency if it could not be thinking about these things, and in a way, thinking ahead of the Department of Manpower Services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question in subsection (3) is whether the words as drafted could not be read as excluding the evidence offered by a declarant that he was in line with the recommendations of the Department. Perhaps I could make a suggestion to the right hon. Gentleman. The Opposition have no wish to limit the considerations to the Department of Manpower's recommendations, but we say that those recommendations ought to be taken into account by the appeals board in any of these appeals. Would he therefore be prepared to consider whether some other formulation which would meet his point could be decided upon, such as—I am not attempting to draft wording while on my feet—"shall amongst other considerations have regard to"? I am not proposing that the right hon. Gentleman would wish to respond to that suggestion immediately, but in the light of what was said on "Clause 7 stand part", perhaps he would be willing to consider the two suggestions I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are extremely concerned about this matter. As the Minister well knows, there may be companies on the Falls Road, in Sandy Road, the Shankhill Road, Newtonard Road, Coalisland and other places, whose only excuse—if that is the word—for the circumstances which exist in their factories is that, despite taking account of all the recommendations in the guide to good manpower policy, they are still confronted with a work force which is predominantly Catholic or Protestant. They may feel that the only thing with which they can go to the appeals board is the guide to good manpower policy, set against their own employment and recruitment policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A straight head count would indicate that they were still guilty of all sorts of things, but because of the security situation, their geographical location, and the population basis, they were still unable radically to change the composition of their work force. If the only thing they could say was "There is the guide.

In effect, the Amendment allows the appeals board to take into consideration the very factors outside the guidelines. That is why "may" was used as opposed to "shall". "Shall" would narrow the situation possibly to where the guidelines became the sole criterion, whereas the word "may" in effect, allows it to go beyond the criterion. The very point that the hon. Member made would have to be taken into account in a Northern Ireland context.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come, in this clause, to one of the methods whereby the register of declarants is to be used as a means of bringing pressure to bear upon employers in Northern Ireland. I do not think that that is an unfair description. My hon. Friends and I are anxious that such pressure as is brought to bear should be fairly brought to bear, and that it should be brought to bear in a manner which is in accordance with the rule of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would limit the duties of the agency under the clause merely to publicising the names of employers and organisations on the register. All and sundry would not simply be told "Here is the register of people who signed this declaration and you can draw your own conclusions, which may be right or may be wrong, as to those who have not signed it." The clause, instead of leaving it there—and it would be difficult to deny the agency the right to publish the list: it cannot be argued that the list should be kept a dark secret—goes on to make specific requirements as to notifying public authorities. These are presumably public authorities which will have occasion to require the services of employers who may or may not have signed the register.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, therefore, a clear implication in the body of the clause that the public service, in deciding between two contractors or two persons who may offer their services, or sell their goods or services, to a public authority, should prefer the persons who were on the list of declarants to those who were not. I can see the heads on the Government Front Bench nodding like cuckoo clocks, so I
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
accept that it is the intention of Government Departments to discriminate, if I may use the dread word, between those who have decided voluntarily—and that was the word—to subscribe to the declaration, and those who, for whatever personal reason, have voluntarily decided not to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposition which I wish to put to the Committee is that if it is the intention of the Government and of Parliament that a condition of supplying or contracting for these Departments in Northern Ireland should be that the persons selected to supply or contract are declarants—declarants that they intend to keep the law—we should do this in a straightforward and not an underhand manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since before the First World War there has been a fair employment clause in Government contracts which was openly publicised and accepted as Government policy by Parliament after Parliament and Government after Government. The terms are published and stated, and a contractor well knows what he must or must not do in order to be a contractor for a Government Department. My hon. Friends and I submit that it is more in accord with the rule of law, with fair dealing and a society living under the rule of law, if that is the intention of Parliament, that we should achieve it by the plain provisions of a Bill. It can hardly be said that the methods by which the Bill proceeds under the clause are plain or direct. The Bill positively refrains from giving directions—certainly, as to selection of contractor or supplier—to these public authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I would rather that the Government and Parliament came clean. If it is to be the policy that as a condition of fulfilling a Government contract, one not only keeps the law—and that goes without saying—but that, right or wrong, the declaration in this Bill is subscribed to, let them say so. Let them do it in one of two ways—either by a provision in an Act of Parliament, or by the same method by which the fair wages clause has been, in effect, the known and acknowledged law of the land since about 1912.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of that, we have this extraordinary procedure whereby the contents of the register are notified to those bodies. I assume that the bodies are an all-embracing list, though somewhat indirectly arrived at, of public employment in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
Northern Ireland. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would indicate whether this list is wholly comprehensive, or whether there are any areas of employment and the payment of State money within Northern Ireland which do not come within the scope of the definition of subsection (2) included in the words which the amendment would omit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal point—and we shall come to this again in the context of a later amendment—is that we should not make public authorities the executants of public policy without telling them what is that public policy. If the right hon. Gentleman says "Yes. We want discrimination to be exercised according to whether or not a potential contractor is on the list. But since it is a voluntary declaration we do not think that we should proceed directly to our objective"—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
I am sure that the central point really must appeal to both sides of the Committee. The object, on which I imagine we would generally agree, is that the Government must set a good example and those who are in contact with them must also set a good example. I do not think that would be disputed. But if duress is to be brought to bear, it should be brought to bear directly by provisions in the Bill and by what those provisions, upon their face, do. Therefore, we would prefer that the Government came forward and proposed either a corresponding procedure to the fair employment clauses or wrote into the Bill their actual intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is our objection to this approach in the Bill. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that he is in a serious difficulty and that, in moving the amendment, we are in no way querying the objects of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that this is a serious amendment, but I do not accept that the Government are in any difficulty with it. The Government have a duty, when the Bill becomes an Act, to see that bodies directly related to the Government, as set out here, are informed of the terms of the Bill and, not least, of the publication of names of equal opportunity employers and organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out to the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) that not all organisations which receive money and are, in effect, under the direct control of the Government are listed in this particular clause. Short Brothers and Harland, which is Government controlled, and Harland and Wolff readily come to mind as companies which have not been excluded for any reason other than that if we go along that road, it will be endless. We have included bodies which are, of course, well known as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not trying to get by sleight of hand what they ought to try to obtain frontally, as it were, by legislation. Following the voluntary method of having the list published, the Government have an obligation to inform agencies of the exact terms of the Bill and of the register, and, by the very nature of events, I assume that the agencies will take into account those who are and those who are not registered. Compelling people, trying to close every door and batten down every hatch would, in legislation terms, be almost an impossibility.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
It is sufficiently known that the employment clauses—which have operated, as the right hon. Gentleman said, since the early part of this century—I have, in essence, been a guide to fair employment practices in contracting the normal standards that a Government would expect in both the public and private sectors. We see this spelling out as the most sensible and practical way of dealing with the matter. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment for the reasons I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the discussion on a previous amendment I asked who could sign, when they could sign, and how soon was "as soon as reasonably practicable". Now we know what "as soon as reasonably practicable" means. It has to be done within six months. On a rough calculation, on the basis of information given previously by the Minister when he told us that there were 35,000 places of employment in Northern Ireland, if firms start queueing from the day that the agency opens its doors they will need to sign once every one and a half minutes for six months to get their names included in the register in time for the first publication at the end of the six-month period. That will undoubtedly have serious repercussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been indicated to me by a number of construction companies, they are already obliged to sign a declaration before they can get a Government contract. In fact, many large construction companies in Northern Ireland already have the very problem that we have so often discussed. There are areas where traditional skills are found. For example, I believe that roofers and slaters come from the constituency of the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt). That is the traditional skill in that area. When the IRA blew the roof off the parish church in Lurgan, people from the Falls Road put it back on again. That was acceptable. That is the situation. Other examples have been cited in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet we are saying to employers who perhaps specialise in roofing and slating, "If you do not get your name on this register and if we do not vet it and establish that you are not guilty of impropriety, your name will not be published and you will not be in a position to contract for Government work". We feel that this proposal sets too strict a
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
time limit. We do not like the implications inherent in issuing a register which exerts undue force on employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly avoid repetition, Mrs. Jeger. I revert to the question whether the list in subsection (2) is embracing. The right hon. Gentleman, intelligently and reasonably, said "Of course, it does not embrace all those who are spending Government money". Indeed, it could not. We would have to pursue all the possible ramifications. However, I take it that it includes Government agencies, Departments of Government, the executives of area boards and local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I probably did not spell it out. I thought I had made the point that the Government agencies are the agencies to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. I excluded firms with Government contracts, Government investment, and so on.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. That makes clear the basis of my proposition that, in relation to all these bodies, except local authorities to which I shall come later, the Government are in a position to issue instructions. There would be nothing to prevent the relevant Departments from issuing a circular to all these bodies saying "You must obtain a list of the declarants of the Declaration of Intent and ensure that you have the up-to-date list". They would be in a position to say "We expect you have regard to that list in selecting suppliers or contractors." And thirdly, "We expect you, if a supplier or contractor in your opinion is in breach of the declaration, to notify the agency as any citizen has the right to do."

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
I take it that it would be within the power of the Departments, as a matter of Government policy, to do just that, to achieve everything, and more, than will be achieved by this clause, and to make a statement announcing that that was what they had done. The right hon. Gentleman could make that statement on one of the subsequent clauses of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, of course, the case of the district councils; but they, of course, are democratically elected bodies who carry direct responsibility for the manner in which they act. Though they might, indeed, be advised by the Government of how the Government were instructing Government Departments, and the wish might be strongly expressed that they would act in a similar manner, it would be natural that no attempt was made to put them under a direct obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I are saying that this clause is the wrong way to go about a perfectly reasonable intention. It is not the sort of thing which ought to be written into a statute, that an agency shall inform public authorities, who, when they think that something is amiss, shall inform the agency. That is not a straightforward way, or a way consistent with good legislation of going about the object of making the Government a good contract letter and an encourager of good behaviour as defined in the Bill. So the reply of the right hon. Gentleman makes it easier to envisage the alternative approach which we believe would be preferable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, the question we are asking—perhaps I am anticipating one which you will be putting presently, Mrs. Jeger, but I put it as a matter of argument—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>is whether this is the kind of thing which ought to be attempted to achieve by a clause in the Bill. I think it would be a good thing if the Government were at some subsequent stage in the Bill to make such a declaration as I have outlined. It would be helpful and would be a perfectly proper thing for a Government to do or say, and they take open responsibility for it to Parliament and to the public. I should like the right hon. Gentleman to consider that and to consider also, in the light of that possibility, whether this clause is necessary.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), and I think that on his last point certainly the Government could consider how best they might give advice on this matter. But basically all we are doing in this clause, and what the amendment seeks to prevent us from doing is to facilitate the task of the agency in informing the public bodies of the exact position. I see no objection to that. It is an open form of administration of government. If we have an agency, why should not the Government inform people of the exact position?

	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i>—Ayes 4, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>As the subsection stands, if a public authority comes to the conclusion that a contractor has, for instance, acted in a manner inconsistent with the Declaration of Principle in performing that contract, it is made an obligation upon the authority
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
by this clause to inform the agency of that opinion. So far as my hon. Friends and I see no objection to that, it being Government policy that Government contractors should be like Caesar's wife. It seems perfectly right that in the event of an apprehended breach of the principles, the contractor should do what any citizen has the right to do, I take it—to bring the matter to the attention of the agency.</p>
	<p>Then there are added the words "or in any other circumstances". These appear to make the public authorities into universal policemen. This appears to rule that if the Post Office were to become aware that an employer in circumstances which had nothing to do with the Post Office, or had nothing to do with any public authority or its contracts, was not acting in accordance with the Declaration of Principle and Intent, they ought to run and tell the agency.</p>
	<p>Of course, all citizens have rights and duties in this respect, but it seems wrong that by statute we should make the public authorities special constables, as it were, for the purpose of policing the Declaration of Intent. I hope, therefore, that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that these five words should not be in the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reasons advanced by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) are, I think, valid.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Debate on this clause affords a convenient opportunity, especially in respect of subsection (5) which
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
deals with the matter of names being added to and removed from the register, to inquire about a question of machinery. It is a matter of machinery that I think will be relevant throughout this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a register of names of persons who have signed the declaration. Clause 9, with which the Committee has just parted, gives the agency the duty of publicising this register. The agency has a duty, too, in circumstances which we considered earlier, to remove names from the register and in certain circumstances to replace names. But presumably the register remains, in a sense, open. It might happen in a number of ways that there would be a trickle of names added to the register. That might happen as a result of employers taking a purist view, if I might so describe it—in other words, changing their minds. Employers might even change their minds when they contemplated the working of Clause 9. It is not for me to speculate on that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, a new firm might be formed. The right hon. Gentleman himself has been instrumental—and we pay tribute to this—in bringing new employers to Northern Ireland who had not previously operated there. That is another source of new names coming continuously on to the register. There is also the fact of the limitations, because it might be held—and perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would refer to the topic—that although Parts III and IV are separate from Part II, it would be unreasonable and clumsy for employers who were below the limits set for the application of Parts III and IV, to sign the register. Whether that be so, certainly one envisages that if a firm expanded in such a way as to bring it within the mischief of Parts III and IV, there would be strong arguments—I put it no higher—for that firm signing the declaration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons there will be a continuing trickle of names coming on to the register. This is a tiresome and untidy situation. We have a register constantly in a state of flux, which, nevertheless, is a public document and is being made the means of proceedings under the compulsory clause of Part II, as well as under the terms of Clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Committee would be interested to hear how the right hon. Gentleman and the Government see the

One falls easily into bureaucratic habits, and I do not believe that any of us would wish to find Government Departments with a special clerk part of whose time was spent in sticking in supplements and making corrections to the agency's register of declarants to the Declaration of Intent. But there is untidiness and clumsiness, and if the Government have given attention to this matter perhaps we might hear their view of how the provision will work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this context I pose the specific question on which I touched. Does the right hon. Gentleman really envisage small employers, with five, eight or 10 work people who will not come within the scope of Parts III and IV for some time, being encouraged to place their names upon this register? Or is the cumbrousness, and indeed the invidiousness, when we have firms of that size, of the distinction between a declarant and a non-declarant, doing more harm than good? If we are to have this procedure, if we are to have a Clause 9 and all that followed from Clause 6, we want the thing to work with common sense. We want it to work with efficiency, and we want it to work without undue complication and official elaboration. We do not want this to be an additional source of bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, therefore, the right hon. Gentleman would favour us with the Government's view of how the provision will work in practice, and how he will avoid this becoming an administrative incubus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see the point developed by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell). Today industry is called on more and more to account for its activities. It creates problems, but they are the problems of a modern society. It does not matter whether it is VAT, or registering for one thing or another, but faced with problems of this sort I agree to the extent that the matter must be handled intelligently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman made the point that small firms are excluded for a period to allow the development of the agency and the registering. The responsibility for the upkeep of the register will lie with the agency. The register will be open to public inspection. Again, I suggest that the agency will have to con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
sider intelligently how often to bring the register up to full strength and keep it accurate. I do not believe that the task will be as difficult as the right hon. Gentleman envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like many issues in industry, I believe that the majority will comply. There may be difficulties on the periphery with certain problems, but I believe that we shall find consistency. For instance, once a firm has gone on the register, I believe that it will want to remain. It will not be going on and off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty of putting firms on, in the initial stages, will cause a considerable amount of work, but I submit that that will be taken care of. I do not think that it is possible to legislate in the definitive terms advanced by the right hon. Gentleman. I suggest that we must allow the agency to use its good sense and perhaps be guided by the type of arguments used in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee, but the right hon. Gentleman took my point about small firms. In respect of Clause 37(4) which is germane to our debate, would the Minister give a little more attention to the way in which the process will work in relation to small firms? I ask your indulgence, Mrs. Jeger, in referring for this purpose to Clause (374) at this point. That clause says that no provision of Part II applies to small firms, if I might so define them, there set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What exactly will that mean in relation to the declaration of intent? Does it mean that the agency will refuse the signature of a firm which employs fewer than 25 people—and I am deliberately putting the question in a comprehensive form as I envisage that that may be of some assistance to the right hon. Gentleman—or does it mean that when a firm which is on the register and formerly employed 50 employees falls upon hard days and the total falls to 24 employees, its name must be taken off the register? I assume that it means that if a firm falls on good days and its lines are cast in pleasant places and its employment roll rises from 20 to 40, it will then come within the ambit of the clauses which we have been discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two specific questions arise: first, whether a firm which falls below the limit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
has to scratch, so to speak, from the list of declaration; and, second, whether a firm, though below the limit, is turned away from the agency's door and told "My dear friend, you may have all the enthusiasm and commitment in the world to non-discrimination and equality of opportunity but you cannot come on to this list." The two questions are to some extent linked together. I think that the more clean, as it were, the right hon. Gentleman can make the ambit of the register, the easier it will be to police and the less bureaucracy there will be in the administration of it. It may be that he has a little advice for the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I have. I thought I was right about this, and it has been confirmed that in effect firms below the total—and we are dealing with firms that will be excluded for the first two years of this measure—could sign the declaration, but that having done so they would not be liable to the regulation statutory duty and it would be quite informal—in other words, the signing of the register for firms below the total to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. Therefore, the offences in Clause 10 would not apply to these particular firms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for coming back at the right hon. Gentleman, but he realises, as does the Committee, that it is these matters of how something actually works which is the business of this Committee to try to envisage. He has said that in the first year a firm employing only 15 employees could sign but that none of the consequences of not signing—namely, in terms of being taken off the register, in terms of being forced to reaffirm or in terms of the penalties—would apply to that firm. Presumably, however, the terms of Clause 9 would apply to that firm, because if it is on the register, that firm's name is within the list of firms that have to be notified to public authorities. Although no penal—I think that they are technical, not penal—sanctions, no statutory sanctions would follow, we are saying in the Bill: first, it is voluntary to sign and, second, Part II does not apply to a firm with fewer than 25 employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, in the case of firms with 15 employees—and this is a very real possibility in circumstances of supplying or contracting to public authorities, because
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
there must be many firms with fewer than 25 employees who contract with local authorities—one can envisage that a discrimination might be made between two firms employing fewer than 25 people, one of which has voluntarily signed a register which was not voluntary under the terms of Clause 6 but was excluded from application to the Bill by the terms of Clause 37. Nevertheless, a 	<i>ratio decidendi</i> between that firm and another—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Translation, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mrs. Jeger. A ground of distinction, perhaps, rather than of discrimination, would be set up. I think it is one of those legal tags which we get away with in the House and in Committee, even though they are not the choicest of Latinity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the right hon. Gentleman has apprehended a problem here and perhaps he can respond now or reply later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the regulations under Clause 9 would not apply. I will further check the point and if that is not correct I will obviously inform the Committee. But that is how I see the situation at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now coming to those clauses in the Bill which the Opposition find most contentious and most objectionable. It was in the early stages of the Committee's proceedings that reference was made to a letter and questionnaire which I sent out. The Minister stated that it was biased, slanted and was intended to get a response from the people to whom I sent it in order to assess their opinion on this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know the rules about repetition. I hope we are not going to have the same debate again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you remember, Mrs. Jeger, on that occasion I refrained from getting involved in the debate and I accepted your ruling at that time but I said that I would have to make some comment when we reached the clause. I will keep my remarks brief, but I want to clarify my position, and I think the Minister would want me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paragraph which the Minister stated as being misleading was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, the means of achieving this objective adopted in the Bill is to establish a Fair Employment Agency, which will be empowered to require employers to record and disclose the religious affiliations of their work force."</p></blockquote>
The Minister subsequently denied that and gave us a categorical assurance that that would not be the case. I accept that and I regret if I implied that in my letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the power in Schedule 5 that if the agency so desires, it could empower an employer to do this, but we shall be discussing that later. What we were touching upon, and what we were careful to do in the questionnaire, was not so much to debate who would keep or collate the register but to deal with the concept of keeping registers of religious affiliations. The question in the questionnaire referred to was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do you believe that the keeping of a register of the religious beliefs of your employees will be helpful in guaranteeing equal opportunity?"</p></blockquote>
We did not state there who was to keep it, but I accept that the inference from the accompanying letter was that the employer would keep it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrespective of who was to keep it, 100 per cent. of the 70 replies received stated that they did not think the keeping of registers of religious affiliations would be helpful. That reinforced our view because the Opposition felt very strongly about this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in the debate the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) referred to another investigation which has taken place in Northern Ireland. He said that the findings of that body—the Cameron Report—justified this Bill. That is what this debate is all about and the reason why this legislation is so necessary. He was encouraged to put certain things on record by his hon. Friend the Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham) who interjected to seek your support, Mrs. Jeger, in helping the hon. Member for Belfast, West to quote extensively from the Cameron Report—and, of course, much of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
findings of the Cameron Report were based on an attempt to identify and keep under review patterns and trends of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bodies which were trying to identify and keep under review the patterns and trends of employment in Northern Ireland at that time were affiliated to the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, and the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) was closely associated with that movement. He did not quote the comment in the Cameron Report that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"his conduct in our judgment was reckless and wholly irresponsible in a person occupying his public position".</p></blockquote>
I hope that we shall not be able to accuse him of that during his time on this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told that the Committee that produced the Cameron Report, which was used as justification for the Bill and these clauses, was set up by this Government. But of course it was not set up by this Government. It was set up by the Northern Ireland Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am trying to be lenient with the hon. Gentleman, but he is going a little wide of the clause, which deals with the identification of patterns and trends of employment. Perhaps he could relate what he is saying to the clause. I realise that it is difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was argued earlier that justification for the clause was to be found in the Cameron Report, which came to certain conclusions based on the identification of trends and patterns of employment. I suggest that the identification of trends and patterns of employment is extremely dangerous and difficult and could lead to all sorts of erroneous conclusions, many of which are found in the Cameron Report. We need to get to the meat of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I acquired at the weekend lists of names of employees of the Londonderry District Council and the Newry and Mourne District Council. I assume that this would be a first step in the agency's task if it was to identify trends and patterns of employment in local councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) told us that the report was horrendously explicit on the religious affiliations of individuals in Northern Ireland. I did not inquire into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
the religious affiliations of these people. Perhaps the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak can tell us when he returns, as he is obviously an expert on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Newry and Mourne District Council, which encompasses a large area of my constituency and that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), covers a mixed population of about 50,000, so it is a very influential body. Its clerk is Mr. P. J. O'Hagen; its assistant clerk is Mr. Kevan O'Neill; its finance officer is a Mr. Joseph Morgan; its recreation and tourist officer is Mr. Raymond Turley; his assistant is a Mr. Quinn—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not sure how the names of these excellent gentlemen—excellent, I am sure they are—are helping to advance the work of the Committee in its consideration of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am highlighting the difficulties and dangers which will be implicit in trying to establish patterns and trends of employment in Northern Ireland based on religious affiliations. It has been argued here that names, religion and education are so intertwined that one cannot avoid this problem. It is important to look at this because it highlights a danger implicit in the Bill. The engineer is a Mr. Ellison and his assistant is a Mr. Michael McCreesh. In housing, which is no longer in the control of local councils, the area manager is a Mr. McGivern, and the district managers are Mr. McDonnell and Mr. Murphy. In all my dealings with those people—and I have had daily and weekly dealings with them—I have always received extreme courtesy. I am convinced that their efficiency and the manner in which they do their jobs could not be faulted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman is trying to help the Committee but it would be more useful if he could indicate the relevance of the names of individuals to the matter of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is "horrendously explicit", in the words of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, because, as the hon. Member for Belfast,
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
West (Mr. Fitt) confirmed, all of those people are Roman Catholics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman know? I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked a member of Newry and Mourne District Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the interjection of the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) is to be recorded, the hon. Gentleman should rise, provided the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) gives way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman know?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I asked a member of the council to confirm it to me. We cannot avoid this. We are now getting down to the unpleasant nitty gritty business of identifying patterns and trends of employment. Someone must keep a register of employees with their religious affiliations recorded alongside them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Someone is keeping one already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying for one minute that that implies gross, widespread, systematic discrimination. The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) is saying that. His argument for two weeks has been that if one looks at a particular organisation, counts the heads and lays down religious affiliations alongside them, on the basis of what one counts up, that is evidence of discrimination. He has quoted many examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a council responsible for 50,000 people in Northern Ireland, controlled by some of the stars and some of the bright up-and-coming members which the hon. Member for Belfast, West leads. On his assumption, if one counts heads and puts religions alongside them, if for any reason, there is an imbalance, that council is guilty of mass systematic discrimination. He is, in fact, telling us that the members of his party who control this council are also guilty of such a practice. I am not saying that. I do not believe that that is the situation. I believe that there are certain circumstances and conditions which have brought this about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>237</span>
and I hope that the hon. Member, if he cannot accept what I am saying, can explain what did create it. That, of course, is one example and one swallow does not make a summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Londonderry District Council, a large and influential district council in Northern Ireland, in the Cameron Report was indicted, when it was Unionist-controlled of being guilty of all sorts of discriminations in employment. The Clerk to Londonderry District Council—and I know that this is unpleasant and unpalatable, but this is what we are entering into and we must face up to it if this is the way that the Government want to go forward—is Mr. Geary, his assistant Clerk is a Mr. McKinney, the finance officer is a Mr. Healey, the recreation and tourist officer is a Mr. Cathal Logue, his deputy is a Mr. Shedden, the manager of technical services is a Mr. McCorkell, the area housing manager is a Miss McAneeney, and the district housing managers are a Miss O'Boyle, Miss McAnee and a Mr. McIntyre. I do not think that all of them are Roman Catholics, but eight or nine out of the ten or twelve names I listed are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the hon. Gentleman know?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know because I inquired from people in Londonderry. For the agency to find out this information. when it comes to keep registers of the religious affiliations of every employer in Northern Ireland, it will also have to ask someone. So we must ask. If we cannot get the information voluntarily, the agency will, of course, be given other powers to acquire it by other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no dealings with these individuals, but I have no reason to think that they do not fulfil their duties and their functions in a perfectly adequate and normal way. I do, however, remember that shortly after the council was established and it had recruited the senior personnel, it was put to it: "This does seem rather like a turnabout from the old council"—which was alleged to have discriminated grossly in favour of Protestants—"and now the evidence would appear that you are doing the same". The comment was made which I accept, "Well, perhaps Protestants simply did not apply". That may well
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
be the reason why there is an imbalance in such positions. But if that excuse was made in this Committee on behalf of some of the firms which have been listed by the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt), it would have been laughed out by Members on the other side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a disagreeable exercise, but it was done to highlight the problem which we are getting to here. If this agency is to identify and keep under review patterns and trends of employment in Northern Ireland, it must keep registers of employees with their religious affiliations alongside. On that basis they will have to take certain actions, and, whether one wants to talk about quotas or deny that there will be quotas, implicit in the affirmative action that will be taken is a desire to try to rectify the situation, to correct the balance. I hope to come back to the matter, not necessarily on this clause. We shall be reaching the nitty gritty on other clauses, but I am sure that my colleagues have something to add to my remarks on this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If any justification were needed for the introduction of this legislation, we have certainly just seen it in the attitude, the demeanour, the wording, the terminology and the sheer hatred of the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker). That hatred was not directed against any member of the Committee, but I take it from the very fact that the hon. Member felt compelled to mention names of individuals in the two local councils which he has carefully selected, in the hope that in some way or other it will justify his case in discussing patterns of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I were to engage in a similar exercise I could immediately apply my knowledge of Belfast City Council and Coleraine City Council, for example. I should not, in any circumstances, try to besmirch the names of individuals employed by local authorities, as has been done by the hon. Member for Armagh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the hon. Gentleman saying? He has pointed the finger directly at individuals and councils. He has tried to give the impression that Londonderry City Council is now controlled by the party that I represent, the SDLP, and that it has engaged in discriminatory practice since the councillors were elected. That is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
the full implication of the hon. Gentleman's remarks. He went over the names—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact is that the SDLP does not control Londonderry City Council. Many council members belong to the Unionist Party. Indeed, some of the most extreme Loyalists are represented on that council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least one Loyalist has been mayor of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned two local authorities to show that discrimination in favour of Catholics exists in those authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said just the opposite.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman then went on to wash his hands of the affair by saying "I know these gentlemen. They are good officers of the local authority. I have always got on well with them", after mentioning their names. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There are too many sedentary interruptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the basis of the hon. Gentleman's argument? He mentioned the Cameron Report, which gave reasons why there were troubles in Northern Ireland, brought about by a continuous system of discrimination and victimisation for many years against one section of the community. The complete justification is not only in Cameron. It is found in all the other reports of committees set up by the Conservative Government and the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the reason for the legislation? If there had been no problems, there would be no necessity for the clause. I am talking about patterns of employment, and how the clause will enable the agency to inquire into patterns of discrimination, to see whether equality of opportunity exists, and, if it believes that it does not, to inquire into the reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member says, first, that there is discrimination in the local authorities
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
to which he referred. What he says, in fact, is that there are fewer cases of discrimination amongst Catholics in Northern Ireland, but, given the majority/ minority population basis, there is not an awful lot of discrimination. I accept that it may exist in Northern Ireland; he accepts that it may exist, but is saying "Do nothing". He is advocating, in fact, that we should not take any steps whatsoever to inquire into the various bodies which employ labour in Northern Ireland, to see whether there are patterns of discrimination, and to take whatever steps we can to eradicate this evil or to abolish discrimination from industry in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause is, I believe, one of the major clauses in the Bill, because it is only by giving such power to the agency that it can be enabled to inquire of every local authority, of necessity, and every firm which employs labour in Northern Ireland, to see whether it is possible to begin to tackle the problem of discrimination which has been with us for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with every other clause in the Bill, those who are opposed to discrimination, those who are responsible, be they from employers or the trade union organisations in Northern Ireland, have had the full support of this clause. The opposition to the inclusion of this clause will, I believe, be received with regret in Northern Ireland by all those who want to see the evil practice of discrimination ended. They will not take too kindly to the attitude which has been put forward this morning by the hon. Member for Armagh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) and I tabled an amendment to leave out Clause 11, because we wanted elucidation from the Minister of State on what he means precisely by "patterns and trends of employment."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers proposed to be given to the agency are wide and a great deal will depend on how the agency interprets its powers and uses them. We need some precision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Working Party discussed in paragraph 114 what it called
	<br><blockquote><p>"the well-known difficulties involved in establishing religious discrimination".</p></blockquote>
In the next paragraph we find these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Generally speaking, however, it is reasonable to expect such attitudes to be reflected in overall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
employment patterns. By particularising without stating the precise context, we risk misunderstanding or misinterpretation. To illustrate what we have in mind, however, it would frequently be reasonable to conclude, in the absence of an adequate explanation to the contrary, that a firm which employed no Catholics or alternatively no Protestants, despite the fact that it had received well qualified applicants of that affiliation, had been practising discrimination."</p></blockquote>
We are, I think, in some difficulty because, as was said by the hon. Member for Armagh, how can one in fact get this right without running some risk of laying down numerical balances—in other words, quotas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made it clear, as the Working Party proposed, that there should be no question of quotas in this legislation. But I am not sure how the agency will be able to do what it seems is required of it without resorting to quotas in some form or another. I may be wrong, but I think that I would like to
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
hear more from the Minister on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As so often happens, the hon.
