<div class='page-header'><h1>FAIR EMPLOYMENT (NORTHERN IRELAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Airey Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That further consideration of the Bill be now adjourned.</p></blockquote>
There are, of course, many precedents for your accepting such a motion. My first point is that we have only just received the Amendment Paper and we have not had time to give proper consideration either to the amendments or to the Report of the previous proceedings, which we have not seen. This makes further deliberation and consideration of the Bill very difficult.<br><br>
It is, of course, imperative that these papers are deployed within a reasonable period, and I have no doubt that you, Mrs. Jeger, will cause inquiries to be made to ensure that this is so.<br><br>
That is not my only reason for moving to adjourn the Committee. My other reason is that, if we examine the financial effect of Part VI, we see that the total expenses of the agency and of the appeals board come to a considerable amount£150,000—to be paid out of the Consolidated Fund for Northern Ireland, and there are also other expenses.<br><br>
The Government's policy on public expenditure relates to Northern Ireland, and the appropriate table on page 112 of the White Paper shows the Northern Ireland expenditure for the present financial year. It is quite clear from the White Paper that the policy for the United Kingdom applies to Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I shall remind you, Mrs. Jeger, only briefly of the Government's position on public expenditure policy. They have at the moment and this is rather unpleasant, even in respect of a Standing Committee—no majority in the House of Commons, and this Bill could not be implemented as things are. Further consideration of the Bill is extremely difficult when it is not known whether they will ever be in a position to implement it in relation to their public expenditure policy.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
I therefore propose that the Committee should adjourn to a day subsequently to be fixed, on the grounds that the Government could not implement the Bill and that further consideration would be irrelevant until the Government's intentions are known. It is not known, for instance, whether the Prime Minister will come before the House at 3.30 p.m. to make a statement. Perhaps he will, but it is not known whether he will. It is not known whether the Government will resign or whether they will seek a vote of confidence during the day. Constitutionally they are not in a position to raise the money which, it appears from Part VI of the White Paper, is to be the Northern Ireland expenditure.<br><br>
I suggest that all these are considerations which you should bear in mind, Mrs. Jeger, and I invite you, therefore, to accept this motion on the ground that further consideration of the Bill should be delayed to a day to be fixed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether you intend to put the motion, Mrs. Jeger, which I think may just have been moved by the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave). If it is your intention, I shall defer my remarks until you have put the motion, otherwise I should like to continue to address you on a point of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to try to help the Committee, and I ask its indulgence for my poor state of health.<br><br>
It is for the Chair to decide whether to accept the motion for the adjournment in these circumstances—indeed, in any circumstances. My view is that I cannot accept such a motion. I certainly could not accept the motion on the ground of difficulty over papers, although I sympathise on this point. We are doing our best to see that the Committee is well served with documents, but there is an industrial dispute which is the reason for the late arrival and the form of the amendment papers. I do not think there is any great hardship involved, because as far as this morning's business is concerned, there are no new amendments. These amendments were all on papers which the Committee has received previously. As for the OFFICIAL REPORT, I have a copy and I hope that other hon. Members are able to obtain copies. Therefore, I honestly think that the best thing we can
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0086">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
do is to get on with the job for which we have been appointed, which is to proceed with the examination of this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. We are obliged for your guidance on the two matters which were raised by the hon. Member for Abingdon. May I briefly refer to both of them, as they concern the further work of the Committee. As regards papers, I quite appreciate that the amendments to which we are shortly to address ourselves have been on the papers for a considerable time. Nevertheless I hope it will be borne in mind that members of the Committee rely upon using at each of its sittings the new Amendment Paper. Indeed that is the only way in which confusion in the identification and debate of amendments can be avoided. I personally have the habit, which I confess has worked out to my disadvantage on this occasion, of most scrupulously destroying the old amendment paper beyond the point which has been reached in committee, taught by experience that that will save me trouble at a later stage. However, I think the Committee should take the view that in the exceptional circumstances, though they would not otherwise justify the Committee proceeding, we can deal with the clauses immediately before us with the provision which we have.<br><br>
I shall refer even more briefly to the other matter raised on a point of order by the hon. Member for Abingdon, by saying that it is the view of my hon. Friends and myself that although we have made plain, and shall continue to do so, our objections to this Bill, because we can see that it is not well calculated to achieve its object, it is not our intention, either in this context or indeed in any other context, avoidably to waste the time of the Committee or to defer the consideration of the Bill or its eventual passage into law, we hope with considerable improvement. We do not, therefore, find in anything which has happened in the Chamber reasons why it is not proper—indeed, right—for this Committee to continue to obey the orders given by the House to consider the Bill clause by clause.<br><br>
There is one further observation which I might make, still upon this point of order, to avoid bringing it up at a later stage when the Under-Secretary addresses himself to the first substantive debate. I am sure I am speaking with the agreement of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
all members of the Committee when I say that we are deeply sympathetic with the hon. Gentleman this morning, because not only is he bereft of the assistance of the Minister of State and left to defend alone and single-handed the Bill—which in many respects, as will presently appear, is in its form indefensible—but he must have great difficulty in concentrating his mind upon what is before the Committee. The statement of Dr. Johnson is celebrated, that it concentrates a man's mind wonderfully to know that he is to be hanged within a fortnight, but the hon. Gentleman's difficulty is that he does not know whether or not he is to be hanged within a fortnight or any other specific period of time. I am sure that it will, therefore, be understood and that we shall realise that the Under-Secretary is bound to be a little below par in the proceedings in Committee this morning, and we shall make all due allowance.<br><br>
I hope, Mrs. Jeger, that I have not unduly widened the boundaries of the point of order which was raised by the hon. Member for Abingdon.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. J. D. Concannon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Jeger. In reply to those remarks of sympathy, it is just one of those things when a Yorkshireman seemingly has to play second fiddle to a Lancashireman, even though it is a Lancashireman of very high repute. All I can say is that my bat is straight as any Lancashireman's bat this morning, though I may not be as good at the flashy shots—the hook shots and so on. When we continue with the proceedings, I think hon. Gentlemen will find that I have done my homework.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. We are genuinely sorry that you are not feeling absolutely fit, Mrs. Jeger. That would seem to be a very good reason why we might, without great loss to the Committee, have an adjournment.<br><br>
There are those of us who would like to adjourn in order to drink a birthday toast to the Prime Minister in pink champagne.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. W. Stallard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Afterwards.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, perhaps. We sympathise very much with the Prime Minister in his predicament at this time. The fact that we have one Minister in the Standing Committee illustrates the fact that we have half an administration in being at the present time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a bit cheap. There is only half an Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a very good half of an administration, a very tall half and a very lively half. We are delighted to see the hon. Gentleman. We know that he will acquit himself worthily. He did not have to tell us that.<br><br>
However, it seems reasonable that we should adjourn, Mrs. Jeger. I could not follows the logic of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell). On the one hand, he said that it was unnecessary that the Standing Committee should adjourn and that it could quite well proceed. But then his quotation from Dr. Johnson made me think that what he really had in mind was that we should adjourn for a fortnight, because that would be the time after which we would know whether the Under-Secretary was still with us. But be that as it may, we bow entirely to your ruling, Mrs. Jeger.<br><br>
However, if you do not wish to accept the motion moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon, it is open to you to suspend the Committee informally because there are various matters we should like to think about. I am sure you would like some respite.<br><br>
There is no disposition to delay the Bill. You will agree, Mrs. Jeger, that we have all been most constructive. We have not been dilatory. In view of the ambiguity of the Government at the present time—if there is a Government in reality—I feel that you should hearken to what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon. If you do not wish to accept his motion, perhaps you will, of your own volition, suspend the Committee informally for a suitable period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have already ruled that I shall not accept a motion for the adjournment. Any further points of order must be genuine points of order.<br><br>
I thank hon. Members for their solicitude for me, but I can assure them that my laryngitis is inflicting more pain on them
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
than it is on me. The best thing that we can do is proceed with our work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Jeger. You have ruled against my motion that the Committee do adjourn, but it still is a matter to which I should like an answer—and it cannot come from you, Mrs. Jeger—namely, what the Government's position is in regard to their financial policy and this Bill. Perhaps the Minister could tell us what the position is. Are we in a position to consider the Bill from the Government's point of view?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister were to try to do so, I should immediately rule him out of order. The business before the Committee is Amendment No. 28, with which it will be convenient to discuss the following Amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 29, in page 4, line 25, leave out subsection (3).</p>
<p>No. 30, in Clause 7, page 4, line 29, leave out from Declaration ' to end of line 34.</p>
<p>No. 31, in Clause 7, page 4, leave out lines 38 to 41.</p>
<p>No. 32, in Clause 7, page 5, leave out lines 3 and 4.</p>
<p>No. 33, in Clause 7, page 5, leave out lines 18 and 19.</p>
<p>No. 34, in Clause 8, page 5, line 39, leave out ' of Principle and Intent'.</p>
<p>No. 70, in Clause 9, page 6, line 31, leave out of Principal and Intent'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. This is an entirely different, and accurately so described, point of order. You have indicated the amendments which we shall be considering together, but I am sure that we would be obliged if you would confirm that it will be in order to refer in detail to the Third Schedule. It is impossible to consider Clause 6 without being able to look at the wording as well as the principle of the Third Schedule. I hope that you will, while allowing that, not close your mind as yet, at any rate, to the question whether there should be a debate on "clause stand part", in relation either to Clause 6 or the Question on Schedule 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are matters which will arise later and I shall keep an open mind, as I do on everything.</span></p>

Clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DECLARATION OF COMMITMENT TO, AND INTENT TO IMPLEMENT, PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 28, in page 4, line 18, leave out from 'declaration' to end of line 21 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'in the form set out in Schedule 3'.</p></blockquote>
Superficially this declaration is again meant to tackle the wordiness of the clause and to tidy it up as we have tried with other clauses, and in doing so, to remove the nonsense of such terminology as
<br><blockquote><p>"… of commitment to the principle of equality of opportunity, to be known as "the Declaration of Principle and Intent", and to encourage their members to subscribe to it."</p></blockquote>
If there is a declaration to be signed, that declaration is detailed in the Schedule. Here it is sufficient to say that people would be encouraged to sign that. It is not necessary to spell out details in this clause as is being done. That is a superficial reason.<br><br>
Our objection is much more fundamental because we are starting to pile nonsense upon nonsense. It is an insult to the hard-working, dedicated management of factories and organisations and other work places throughout Northern Ireland to suggest that they should sign such a declaration. It has nothing to do with the likelihood of the Bill meeting with any success. Inherent in the suggestion that they should sign the declaration is the fact that prior to signing it, they may well have been guilty of some of the practices that are being alleged against it.<br><br>
The opening words of the clause are "as soon as reasonably practicable". How soon is "reasonably practicable"? Can anyone, for example, sign the declaration prior to receiving the guide on manpower policy, which would be the first time that one is told what is good manpower policy? ICI wrote to me last week, saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"We ourselves have not found any disadvantage in following ICI's general policies regarding recruitment, promotion and general conditions of employment, which apply throughout the United Kingdom. It is part of these policies that we should not have to distinguish between applicants on the grounds of religious beliefs and we have operated on this basis throughout the whole of our time in Northern Ireland."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
Could ICI sign the declaration immediately?<br><br>
Would any one of the other 31,000 places of employment, which we are told by the Minister of State exist in Northern Ireland, have to think a little longer about it? Would they have to know, for example, what they were guilty of before they could take corrective action? Would they have to be advised by the Agency? Would, as I have earlier said, they need to get hold of the guide, study it carefully, search their conscience and then say that they are not in a position to sign the declaration? If it happened to be a construction company which was competing for Government contracts, by not being in a position to sign the declaration, it would rule itself out of consideration for a Government contract.<br><br>
We have many more fundamental objections to this clause, much more detailed than the amendment we have moved. As well as requiring employers to sign the declaration, it also suggests that representatives of employers and workers would be encouraged to sign it. The Minister of State last week cast aspersions on the questionnaire which I sent out to try to get the feel of industry in Northern Ireland for this Bill. He suggested that a questionnaire which was responded to by 60 employers representative of 25,000 workers was not a great deal to go on. Of course, the two or three bodies which will be signing this declaration—and we have already been told that they will be signing it because in Appendix III of the Report they even write their own names in—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going a little wide of the amendment. We can discuss these broader points on "Clause stand part".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mrs. Jeger. We are told who is going to sign it elsewhere, but how representative are they? The Minister told us last week that there are 500,000 workers in Northern Ireland. There are many more of those workers unionised in Northern Ireland—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is still not to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg your pardon, Mrs. Jeger. I think that I have, in some detail, outlined our objections to the clause.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0089">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert J. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) in some of his remarks. I again draw attention to the absurd position where, in signing a declaration of commitment to the principle of equality and opportunity, it is inferred that this is a new attitude on the part of many, if not all, the declarers. This does less than justice to industry, and to relationships within industry, in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
In the wording which we seek to remove—that is, of commitment to the principle of equality of opportunity to be known as a Declaration of Principle and Intent. I suggest that we face the same difficulties that we face in Part I of the Bill, where we have not only the difficulty of unnecessary verbiage, but the difficulty of undefined terms and of discovering just what additions and subtractions will be made to this Declaration by the Government as suits their purpose at any given time. This is a dangerous situation and would reveal that the Government are moving forward into this vital area of Northern Ireland life and into the life of its industry without any clear directions. This Declaration of Princple and Intent must be clearly defined. We must understand what is meant by it.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) made the point that it is well nigh impossible to discuss the Declaration without resorting to a consideration of Schedule 3. In Schedule 3 there is not just a simple statement that the declarant is against discrimination or that he is for equal opportunity, or a certain interpretation which could be conducive to the thinking of only this Government. We read:
<br><blockquote><p>"… bearing in mind the vital importance to industry of a fair and equitable society, …"</p></blockquote>
We would argue that what the Government mean by "fair and equitable" may not accord with the attitude of a future Government. When we compare the two words "fair" and "equitable", we are prone to suspect that the second word "equitable" is not just a confirmation or a strengthening of the first word "fair", but that there is an added meaning, and a significant added meaning.<br><br>
When we talk about an "equitable society", we are really talking about a society where certain rights are given automatically. That has nothing to do with fairness. It has nothing to do with
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
what is deserved by one's contribution to industry.<br><br>
It is not enough to leave the bald statement "a Declaration of Principle and Intent" and then to say in Clause 6(3) that this Declaration shall be in the form as set out in Schedule 3:
<br><blockquote><p>"or in such other form to the like effect as the Agency specifies."</p></blockquote>
There are no bounds to what can be added and no bounds to the particular political interpretation which could be placed on this Declaration. Therefore, we believe that this wording is dangerous and unnecessary and ask that our amendment should replace it.<br><br>
My third point is this. When we talk about "full equality in all aspects of employment opportunity", we again are on dangerous ground, especially when we talk about this Declaration having to be exhibited by particular employers. I pose the possibility that this imposition of a Declaration, whether we like to admit it or not, will result in the emergence of a quota system—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going very wide of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I submit that we cannot in all fairness talk about imposing this Declaration of Principle and Intent. As my hon. Friend said, no Government contract will be given unless one subscribes to this Declaration of Principle and Intent. It is an imposition. However, one cannot talk about this imposition without posing the problems for the employer who has, say, two Protestants and one Roman Catholic applying for a job—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt again, but the amendments are concerned with certain proposed changes of wording and not with the question whether the Agency shall have duties imposed upon it. There will be time to discuss such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mrs. Jeger. I shall conclude and, with your approval, make my comments at a later stage. However, we should like the Government to look carefully at these amendments, and to evaluate the arguments that have been put forward.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0090">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your point, Mrs. Jeger, that these eight amendments seek to make, in form, verbal changes to Clauses 6 and 7. I shall specify what those changes are, and the precise effect which they are intended to have. The Committee has been assisted by the indication which you gave in an intervention when my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) was speaking that you envisage that there will be a "clause stand part" debate.<br><br>
There are four separate effects from this group of amendments and four separate targets at which the amendments are aimed. In the first place, it is proposed to remove the wordy contents of lines 18 to 21, which are a kind of anticipation of the cloudy element to which we object in Schedule 3, so we propose to delete those words because they are the forerunners and earnest of so much to which we object in the terminology of Schedule 3.<br><br>
11.00 a.m.<br><br>
Secondly, we propose to eliminate the words in line 20:
<br><blockquote><p>" to encourage their members to subscribe to it."</p></blockquote>
The construction of the subsection runs:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Agency shall invite such organisations … to encourage their members to subscribe to it."</p></blockquote>
It seems to us quite wrong that, by statute, an agency shall be ordered to invite the CBI to encourage its members to do this or that. We can just manage to swallow an Act which directs an agency to invite the CBI to do this or that, but we simply cannot swallow the proposition that, by statute, an agency should invite the CBI to behave in a certain way towards its members.<br><br>
In the first place, we think it is insulting to the CBI and the TUC to suppose that, having signed this declaration themselves, they would say to their members "Take it or leave it. Take no notice. We do not stand very much in favour of this". It goes without saying, and therefore ought not to go into an Act of Parliament, that if the CBI and the ICTU think fit to sign this declaration—and to sign it as a result of a clause the next subsection of which seeks to encourage employers to sign it—they will say to their members "We have done this on your behalf and we think it is a good thing that you should do it". Therefore, it is not merely superfluous, it is not merely bad law—because it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
purports to deal with matters which ought not to be the subject of law and of statute—it is offensive to bodies of a kind set out in the first subsection.<br><br>
The third target at which our amendments aim is the issuing of certificates. The agency is to keep a register of those who have subscribed. That seems obvious—they are hardly going to chuck the bits of paper away after they have been signed—so that to say that they should keep a register, although it is verbiage for the sake of verbiage, provisions in an Act of Parliament for the sake of putting provisions in, and filling out the Bill and making it appear more than it really is; is not something to which one can take positive objection. But it is quite different when we come to the specification of the issue of a certificate in Clause 7(1), and it is that certificate which we propseo to eliminate.<br><br>
One does not have any difficulty in imagining the certificates. Of course they will be got up on the lines of those certificates which you, Mrs. Jeger, and I and other Committee members were accustomed annually to receive on school occasions, and on other manifestations of prowess, when we proudly brought home in a roll a gilded document which perhaps a member of the family, skilled in carpentry, framed and arranged to be hung on the wall. This is one of those. It will be splendidly got up. At the top it will have "The Fair Employment Agency". I take it that it will have a corporate seal. That is certain. That will be proudly displayed on the bottom right-hand corner, together with the signatures of the members. I am inviting the Committee to contemplate how ludicrous is all this that we are proposing to insert in an Act of Parliament.<br><br>
More than that, I think it would be thought inappropriate that an agency set up by statute should not have its corporate arms in colour, not just tricked, as the heralds say. No doubt, the Under-Secretary will be supporting an application—if he still exists—and perhaps the Under-Secretary will tell us—to ask the King of Arms to issue a coat of arms for the agency. Coat of arms or not, this document will splendidly drawn up.<br><br>
We can all imagine the kind of thing. There it will hang—"Equal Opportunity Employer. We hereby certify that the undermentioned Snooks is an Equal Opportunity Employer." Those words
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
will be in large gothic lettering, and everybody in the waiting room of that office, where they are hoping to make a contract, will stare goggle-eyed at this magnificent document, which says "You have come to call on an Equal Opportunity Employer", or "an Equal Opportunity Organisation."<br><br>
I do not know whether it has been noticed that there is a tendency to use initials for the sake of brevity, instead of the full nomenclature. The letters E and OE have a different meaning. They have a meaning which is printed on the forms which are issued by firms; so the Equal Opportunity Employer—the E and OE employer—will very readily, in the minds of those with whom he has to deal, become an "Errors and Omissions Excepted" employer.<br><br>
Beyond all this jocularity there is a sense of indignation that we should be purporting to put this sort of nonsense in a statute. This will presently become a subject of ribaldry. That is bad enough. But there are more serious aspects as well. Before I come to those, I want to complete my description of the effects of our group of amendments by referring to the fourth effect which the group will have, namely, to eliminate paragraph <i>(a)</i> of Clause 7(2). That paragraph enables the agency to require a declarant, as a condition of remaining on the register—a condition, when we look at page 5, line 17, of not asking him to take the certificate down from the wall of the waiting-room, pack it up and send it back to the agency—
<br><blockquote><p>"to reaffirm, at such intervals and in such manner as the Agency may determine, his intention to adhere to the Declaration".</p></blockquote>
It is a very serious matter that we should be empowering the agency to require a person who has made an affirmation to reaffirm it
<br><blockquote><p>"at such intervals and in such manner as the Agency may determine".</p></blockquote>
That would be regarded by most honourable and decent people as a very serious matter. I invite the Committee to accept that this is not an instruction which should be given by Act of Parliament.<br><br>
The Scripture says:
<br><blockquote><p>" … let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay …"</p></blockquote>
but that is very far from the wording of Schedule 3, to which I shall come presently. I do not know how members of the Society of Friends will feel when they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
are confronted with the proposed declaration in Schedule 3. It goes a little beyond "thy yea being yea and thy nay, nay", to which they are by the tenets of their religion bound.<br><br>
I therefore ask the Under-Secretary to consider very seriously whether, in the very texture and tenor of this Bill, he is not imposing a kind of religious discrimination, because there are those who conscientiously, as well as a matter of common decency and honour, would have objections, first of all to affirming in the form of the third Schedule, to which I shall come presently, but secondly to reaffirming it. They would say that we have their word and their bond; if they have broken it, we must carry on and act accordingly, but that they are certainly not going to be called upon to reaffirm what they have already affirmed.<br><br>
I hope that the Under-Secretary, when he deals <i>serio</i> and <i>seriatim</i>—seriously and in all—supplying, in accordance with your ruling, Mrs. Jeger, as always, the instant translation—with the specific points covered by all these amendments, will tell us what is meant by
<br><blockquote><p>"in such manner as the Agency may determine".</p></blockquote>
Are they to reaffirm with a new formula which the agency is authorised hereby to devise—"I declare upon my word of honour. So help me God "—even more insulting than the contents of Schedule 3? Or are they perhaps to be able to introduce into the form of the affirmation some admission of a previous failure to have done what the declarant or signatory had promised to do?<br><br>
These are the four separate, distinct and valid objections to the Bill as it stands, which this group of amendments seeks to remedy. The last point I made brings me back to the central issue still implicit in the precise points at which these amendments are aimed, read in conjunction with Schedule 6. If we look at Schedule 3, we will find that it is not such a declaration as that to which the citizen ought properly by Act of Parliament to be invited to subscribe. I will take the phrases one by one as they come in the Schedule. The first one was alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford):
<br><blockquote><p>" … bearing in mind the vital importance to industry of a fair and equitable society …"</p></blockquote>
It might, of course, be urged: what objection can anyone have for saying that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
he is in favour of fairness and equity? Of course not. We are all against sin. This is not, however, merely a statement casually made by one person to another.<br><br>
I always try to be fair, and I have always attached great importance to equitable dealing, although I must say that the man who went about saying that would commend himself to me as a humbug. There is an old proverb, and a good one, which is very relevant to the consideration of this schedule: "Beware of the man who says he is honest" because if he goes about saying he is honest, there must be some reasons for doubting his honesty. That is why one always has a slight <i>frisson</i> when one hears hon. Members—no names occur to me—who may say "To be perfectly frank with the Committee", or "To be frank with the House". We should always be frank with the House, and those who listen to us always assume that we are frank with the House. Therefore, it only creates a doubt if one goes around affirming what ought to be taken for granted.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
There is another objection. My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) was right to raise it, and I repeat that we have to address our minds to the wording of Schedule 3 in order to decide whether more than a simple Declaration of Intent in the terms of the Bill—equality of opportunity and nondiscrimination—is justifiable.<br><br>
Another objection is that when we sign a document we ought to do so with the intention that it means the same to others as it means to us. To sign a document which is ambiguous is to commit a kind of deceit. It is to leave it open to oneself to have the reservation <i>in pectore—</i>a mental reservation. I mean one thing by this, but other people might think that I meant something else.<br><br>
Politics is about what is a fair and equitable society. Day by day and Session by Session we assemble in this place in order to contrast different views of what is a fair and equitable society, and then we have the impudence to invite the citizen to sign a declaration in which he says "Bearing in mind the vital importance to industry of a fair and equitable society", when we know perfectly well that those terms mean different things to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
opposite sides of the Committee, and ought to mean different things, if we are doing our work here. It is the debating of those issues, and the deciding of those issues one way or the other, which is the work of Parliament.<br><br>
What humbug it is to write in terms, as if they were perfectly defined statutory terms, about which there was no disagreement whatever, and invite our fellow citizens to sign them. When I say "invite our fellow citizens to sign them", that is not the wording, so I come to the next section of the wording. The Under-Secretary is paying great attention—as, indeed, he should—but if he thinks that the examination of this schedule is a little tedious, that it is time-consuming, he has only himself to blame. If, instead of a plain declaration, this kind of verbiage is put into a Bill to be put on to the statute book—no complaint has yet been made; I thought that I might forestall it just in case—those who are invited—if that is the word—to give their assent to it as the law of the land should look at it very carefully.<br><br>
I come now to the words:
<br><blockquote><p>" affirm and declare without reservation ".</p></blockquote>
That is the next section of wording which, by implication, the first amendment would exclude from Schedule 3. What impudence it is to invite people to make a declaration and to invite them to say that they are making it without reservation. In the ordinary intercourse of life, it would be impudent if one were to say to a person who had made a statement and who had given one a promise, "No, that will not do. You must say that you have made your promise without reservation". Maybe "affirm and declare" is a mere hendiadys—a mere use of two words where one would have done.<br><br>
However, "without reservation" is a more serious matter. I can understand affirming and declaring—an orotund expression, remiscent of the Book of Common Prayer, perhaps, to which no speaker of English would take objection. But I would take very grave objection to being asked to make an affirmation and and declaration with reservation. My retort would be: "When I make an affirmation, I make it without reservation; otherwise I would have told you at the time". So I continue. What is it that he affirms and declares? His commitment to the principle of full equality in all aspects of employment opportunity.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
We have spent time already, Mrs. Jeger, upon the definition of equality of opportunity and have seen in our examination of Clause 3 what difficulties the Government have involved themselves in by the procedure of Part II, based upon equality of opportunity, as contrasted with the procedure of Part III which is aimed at something much more specific, namely discrimination.<br><br>
But we are not now asking the citizen to say that he will provide equal opportunity for his employees as defined in the Bill. Whether we ought to ask him even to affirm that I will come to in a moment, but at least he then knows what he is saying, he knows the meaning of the words and knows what it is that he is putting his hand to. We are all, when we make affirmations, encouraged, exhorted, to read the small print. But what is he to think when what he is to affirm is his commitment to the principle. Many people are committed to many principles, but do not act in accordance with them. They are fully committed to a principle. They tell everybody on the platform and elsewhere of their deep commitment to that principle, but their actions or behaviour do not follow from it.<br><br>
So this is not merely a difficult and ambiguous expression but one which is without practical content. There is no real significance in a person declaring that he is committed to a principle. The question is Will you act in accordance with the principle?".<br><br>
Apart from the objectionable vagueness of this next paragraph of the Schedule, I find it perfectly otiose that affirmation in these terms should be required.<br><br>
I now come to the next part. You will be pleased to know, Mrs. Jeger, that there are only three or four more parts of this Declaration which, I am about to suggest to the Committee, are wholly objectionable. The next one is "utterly reject discrimination". I will not dwell upon the question of the difference between rejecting and utterly rejecting, though I must say that, here again, the question of humbug arises. If a man says "I reject something", I want to assume that he does reject it. I do not assume that when he says "I reject this", he only partially rejects it. "Utterly reject" is more than a pleonasm, more than a piece of bombast. It is an insult to the signatory.<br><br>
Once again, like the earlier portions we have considered, we are putting before the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
citizen a wording which many self-respecting people would refuse on principle to sign—and I will come to the consequences presently of their doing so.<br><br>
"I … reject discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion". Here we come to a different and perhaps even more serious ground of objection. This Bill makes discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion unlawful. That is what most of the Bill is about. It defines those things, with some difficulty, but it endeavours to define them and then makes it unlawful. So we are here inviting the citizen to sign a declaration that he rejects breach of the law, or, to put it baldly, that he does not intend to break the law.<br><br>
I regard it as abominable, Mrs. Jeger, that the citizen should be invited by an agency of Government under the authority of a statute to sign an undertaking that he will not break the law and that others should be encouraged to sign that undertaking. It strikes directly both at the proper relationship between Government and citizen and at the rule of law itself that the citizen should be required by statute to sign a declaration that he will abide by the law. It may be that when he has broken the law and his punishment is being considered a court of the land might properly take into account what assurances and undertakings he was prepared to give for the future. There are subsequent parts of the Bill which make such provision.<br><br>
But I say that it is fitter for Nazi Germany than for the United Kingdom that we should pass a law which solemnly invites a citizen to affirm and declare that he has no intention of breaking the law made by Parliament. This is an impropriety and an insult and it should not stand on the face of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I want to help the right hon. Gentleman.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mrs. Jeger. That makes much more sense of the debate and it will save time because there will be no need to cover that ground at a later stage. We can express our views on the excessive improprieties—if necessary by dividing—when we come to the Third Schedule.<br><br>
Thus encouraged and fortified, I proceed to examine the rest of this document. One needs, for this task a certain encouragement and, in a strictly nonalcoholic sense, fortification. The reason why this sort of stuff is in the Bill and why such an insult is to be imposed upon the citizen is because people have at no stage, either earlier or in the drafting of the Bill, taken the trouble to think about it. There are a number of contexts for the well-known American phrase about "The buck stops here." But the House of Commons is the place where the buck should stop when the buck is the use of words which will be given the force of law.<br><br>
What has gone wrong? The reason why the Committee this morning must spend so much time, very necessarily, considering this wording, which is far more than a matter of drafting, is because at no previous stage has anyone taken that seriously. They have said "Oh. That is all right. Declaration of Intent. Splendid idea." But they have neither read nor thought about it. I shall later come to examine, as far as possible, what part the Under-Secretary and his friends have played in the drafting of this Bill and what attention they have given, before it was presented to the House of Commons, to what was going into the Bill. But it is mere carelessness at earlier stages of gestation which has necessitated our disagreeable task this morning of examining phrases which should never have made their appearance in print.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
I come to the second paragraph of the Declaration of Principle and Intent where the declarant affirms that it is his duty—if it is in an Act of Parliament, it is his duty—and his intention—if it is the law it must be his intention—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"to implement and maintain policies and practices designed to secure equality of employment opportunity at all times and to all persons".</p></blockquote>
I invite the Committee to turn at this point to page 9, line 25. The Under-Secretary may find it convenient to follow the reference I make, as he will have to answer this point. I direct his attention to page 9, Clause 13, line 25, which bears directly upon the propriety or otherwise of this wording in the Declaration, for the Declaration is in much wider terms than the legal requirements in the Act. The legal requirements in the Act—let us consider paragraph (a), to which I have referred, as a specimen are
<br><blockquote><p>"to secure that he"</p></blockquote>
—namely, the employer or whoever is concerned—
<br><blockquote><p>"takes such action to ensure equality of opportunity as is, in all the circumstances, reasonable and appropriate".</p></blockquote>
That and the rest of these clauses—the law of the land if we pass this—are the duty and should be the intention of the citizen.<br><br>
But when we come to drafting this declaration—we shall come presently to the consequences of his failing to make that declaration—we find that it is not at all in statutory terms, not at all with the limitations written into the Bill that he is sign it. He says it is his duty, which it is not. It is not his duty to secure equality of employment opportunity at all times and to all persons. That is not what the Bill is about. There is no such duty. There will be no such duty when the clauses of this Bill have been passed.<br><br>
I am glad to see that some little reflection seems to be taking place at last in certain quarters upon the propriety of inviting the citizen to sign an affirmation that he has a duty which goes beyond the requirements of the law, for I suppose that is one of the classic definitions of the breach of a rule of law. We are going to spend considerable time in Committee in debate on subsequent clauses in defining the circumstances in which it is the duty I repeat, the duty—of the citizen to secure equality of employment opportunity.<br><br>
I am tempted to interrupt my argument, Mrs. Jeger, to welcome the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) back to these deliberations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You were going to pull a fast one. You thought I was not coming.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I reassure the Committee, the Whip and the hon. Gentleman that the Committee has only just started to address its mind to the difficulties implicit in the wording of Schedule 3. I was going to say to the hon. Member for Belfast, West that in the inevitable reconstruction of the administration I hoped he was able to find a place, and that it was the reason for his unusual absence.<br><br>
I hope I have made my point clearly, for it was a very precise and serious one about the second paragraph of this declaration. I hope I have made the position clear to the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
Finally, let us look at the last paragraph of that declaration, which says.
<br><blockquote><p>"In making this Declaration I/We undertake to take all possible steps to achieve the aims and promote the principles to which it refers "—</p></blockquote>
then come the words—
<br><blockquote><p>"in the interests of social justice and economic prosperity ".</p></blockquote>
How on earth did that rubbish ever get into even the first draft of the Bill? <i>[Interruption]</i> I know. I am coming to that. It did not escape my notice that a copy of the van Straubenzee Report, turned open at the relevant Appendix 3, had somehow mysteriously come into the possession of the Under-Secretary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is open at page <i>(v)</i> which deals with the membership.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that, too. All these points will in due course be covered. But for the moment I am considering the term
<br><blockquote><p>"in the interests of social justice and economic prosperity".</p></blockquote>
What is the point of that qualification? Here is a solemn declaration which, if it is reaffirmed, may have to be reaffirmed upon oath—we have not been told what the words
<br><blockquote><p>"in such manner as the Agency may determine"</p></blockquote>
mean. Do those words add to or detract from the meaning of the words which precede them? Does it mean that I undertake to achieve these principles—that is, equality of opportunity and nondiscrimination—only in so far as that is in the interests of social justice and economic prosperity, or does it add something? It must do one thing or the other, or the words would not be in an Act of Parliament, would they? Perhaps the Under-Secretary's legal advisers and draftsmen
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
will tell him whether these words add to or detract from the significance of the preceding affirmation. If so, what it is that they add or what it is that they detract?<br><br>
Let us consider the term—"in the interests of social justice and economic prosperity". Speaking for myself—fortunately I do not employ more than 25 people in Northern Ireland and I am therefore outside the mischief of the Bill, and shall remain so for a considerable time—I would decline to affirm my adherence to the principle of equality of opportunity and non-discrimination in the interest of economic prosperity. I do not think that the ground for justice is the interest of economic prosperity. I would affirm these principles if I thought that a country which affirmed them would be poorer as a result, for justice is better than wealth.<br><br>
Perhaps, as an incidental consequence —I do not know—of eliminating some degree—I again quote from the report—
<br><blockquote><p>"of religious discrimination in Northern Ireland"</p></blockquote>
labour in Northern Ireland will be more productive—marginally, even more than marginally, perhaps. I say only that I do not care whether or not there is such a result.<br><br>
If it is right and just that the citizen should be given the redress and the new rights which are created by this Bill, then it is right and just irrespective of the economic consequences, and I do not think it proper to invite employers, workers or their associations or anyone else to say, when they affirm—if it is proper to make such an affirmation at all—their support for non-discrimination, "We are doing it in the interest of economic prosperity". For myself, I would scorn to say such a thing, and therefore I scorn to invite others to say it.<br><br>
As for social justice, I remember the late Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, a distinguished Member of the House, saying "Beware, when people put an adjective in front of the word 'justice', because if they have to put an adjective in front of it, it cannot be justice that they are talking about". Be that as it may, social justice for those who use the term means different things to different people—very different things to very different people—and different things, perhaps, on different sides of this Committee, different things on different sides of the House,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0096">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
as we observed yesterday evening above and below the Gangway on the Government benches. Thus it is a word—a phrase—of calculated obscurity and ambiguity which we are, as so far advised without any necessity, demanding shall be written into a declaration to which the subject is to be invited to subscribe.<br><br>
Pivoting on that word "invited" I now come to the context of this declaration, strictly confining myself to the use which is to be made of the declaration as covered by the four points of the amendments which are being discussed together. This is voluntary. The word is "invited". But beware of an invitation addressed by the State to the citizen. It is not the business of the State, which has the power to command when it is lawfully provided with that power, to go around inviting people. The natural meaning of an invitation is that it is something which one can decline upon one's own responsibility and without consequences to oneself, contrived at any rate by the State. Whether or not to accept an invitation to dinner it is upon one's own head whether one misses a good meal or boring company.<br><br>
Clause 6 is a prime example of the degeneration of the legislative process, indeed, of the growing breach of the rule of law in this country. It is a voluntary declaration, purely a voluntary matter whether one accedes to the invitation to subscribe to it, whether one succumbs to the blandishments of the agency using its best endeavours to encourage the citizen to subscribe to it. But what is to be done with it afterwards? It is to confer a title—kind of patent—upon the signatory. The words proposed to be left out from Clause 7(1) are a patent, which like all patents—it is the origin of the term—is accompanied by <i>litterae patents,</i> a certificate. Those who sign it are to be certificated.<br><br>
As we proceed through the Bill we shall find that those thus certified are endowed by the <i>Bill—[Interruption.]</i>—Perhaps those who were guilty of trying to put this sort of wording into an Act of Parliament should be certified. It had not occurred to me until the hon. Member for Belfast, West put the wicked thought into my mind about being certified. He should not have tempted me.<br><br>
As we read the Bill we find that this certification, the fact of having signed a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
declaration in these terms, the certification that one has done so and the retention of that certificate upon pain of having it withdrawn—Clause 7(2)<i>(d)</i>—is to have important consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The right hon. Gentleman is getting very near to clause stand part again. I hope he will leave himself something to say subsequently. We are still discussing amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful, Mrs. Jeger. Your solicitude, especially under your handicaps and disabilities, is deeply appreciated.<br><br>
On the clause stand part debate we shall have to go more deeply into the consequences of this voluntary declaration. I shall content myself by saying that it is contrary to the principle of the rule of law that, by statute, the citizen should be advantaged or disadvantaged according to whether he chooses to do something which is held out as being voluntary.<br><br>
Here I pray in aid a remarkable statement which bears directly upon this point, made, no doubt, officially on behalf of the Government, by the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. On 8th March, in responding to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost) the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said:
<br><blockquote><p>"With great respect to the hon. Gentleman, I must say that he misunderstands the meaning of the word 'voluntary'. Very few things in this life are voluntary in the somewhat wide metaphysical sense that it is understood by the hon. Gentleman. By voluntary … we mean that we have taken no legal powers and do not feel such powers will be necessary."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 27.]</p></blockquote>
The evil of this declaration, in the form in which it is drawn, and its certification—of its being held precariously at the will of the agency—is that the Government and the State by this legislation are trying to do by voluntary compulsion outside the due process of law, that which in a State living under the rule of law it ought to do by the law or not at all. It is a profoundly lawless approach that is embodied in the portions of this clause which we are considering.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I fulfil the promise which I made to the Under-Secretary. I promised him that I would inquire a little further into how we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0097">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
became troubled with having the distasteful task of needing so attentively to examine the wording of Schedule 3. I have not a word of criticism for the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) and those who collaborated with him. I am sorry that he is not here to receive that disclaimer in person. It is not to him or his fellow committee members that my criticism runs. When this report was drawn up the Government said "All right, we will accept the report good egg". They threw it over to the Parliamentary draftsman and said, "Hi, turn that into a Bill".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To which amendment is the right hon. Gentleman speaking?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am relating myself exactly to the relationship between Appendix 3 of the Report and Schedule 3 of the Bill, that wording which is summarised in the description in Clause 6 which I am seeking to replace by much simpler wording.<br><br>
That is what I am doing as I draw to the conclusion of this brief initial consideration of the troubles we are getting into over this declaration. Virtually all this wording is in Appendix 3 of the van Straubenzee Report. Without applying their minds to the question whether it was fit for an Act of Parliament, the Government have said that this Act should simply be translated into the terms of a statute. I do not think that is doing the job of Government. It is one thing for Governments to say to the Committee "Thank you very much. We shall look at your proposals in detail and consider how far they are fit to be dealt with by statute". It is not good enough for the Under-Secretary to say—and I hope he will not do so—"Look at Appendix 3 and look at the important people who thought that the wording was good enough for a statute".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You make your speech. I will make mine.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am making my speech. I am anxious not to defer the speech of the hon. Member, which will almost be his maiden speech in this Committee, to which we all look forward. But let me warn him that it will be no defence for the wording of the Bill to say "We found it in the Appendix to a Working Party Report", because when a Working Party has reported, the Government not only
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
have the duty of settling upon policy, but also have a duty which involves considering, without prejudice to what the worthy gentlemen who drew up the report had to say, whether the words that they proposed are fit to be written into an Act of Parliament.<br><br>
I hope that I have given the Committee sufficient reason to reconsider the propriety of the provisions to which we draw attention in this clause and in Clause 7, and with which I hope the Under-Secretary will deal separately, and, above all, the propriety of the imposition upon the citizen of that which is involved in the wording and content of the Third Schedule.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. Earlier this morning you refused to accept my motion for the adjournment of the Committee to await a statement by the Prime Minister. I do not in any way contest your ruling, but I should like to raise another point of order because it has come to my notice that Standing Committee G has adjourned on a Government motion to await the statement by the Prime Minister this afternoon.<br><br>
I do not wish to repeat the points I made because it may well be in your mind that this Bill should not be considered until the Government make a statement this afternoon on their public expenditure policy. I do not need to repeat them, but it is significant that a Standing Committee along this corridor has adjourned, and presumably the Chairman of Standing Committee G has accepted the motion by the Government—not by the Opposition—that it should adjourn until after the Prime Minister's statement this afternoon. People have not taken seriously enough what is at stake as a result of the position that arose in the House and its possible effect on Standing Committees considering Bills involving public expenditure. That is a matter of considerable importance.<br><br>
I, therefore, ask you to consider a new motion. Would you be prepared to accept a motion, That the Committee do now adjourn to a day to be fixed? Would you consider such a motion in the light of this new information?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman, but I think it would be best if we proceeded with our work, irrespective of what other frailer brethren have decided to do elsewhere in the corridor.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0098">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. That refers to the Chairman of Standing Committee G, Mrs. Jeger. I am sure that he is frailer than you would ever be, but it remains a matter of precedent, as far as this morning's Committee is concerned, that a Standing Committee has been adjourned on a Government motion on the same grounds as I moved the motion at the beginning of today's proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I was a little intemperate. The reasons for the adjournment of the other Committee are not known to me. I should not suggest that any frailty is involved. I merely thought that the virility of this Committee would make it more inclined to get on with its work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mrs. Jeger. It is fully within your power to have an informal adjournment. It is only right and fair that the Under-Secretary of State should have the opportunity of consulting his colleagues outside this room to discover why Her Majesty's Government, if that is the term, have moved for the adjournment of a Standing Committee on the grounds mentioned by my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Committee corridor is full of Committees which are continuing to meet, and those precedents are as equally relevant as the case of a Committee which has decided not to meet. We should get on with our work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. May I make a suggestion for the assistance of the Under-Secretary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will look after myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because I know how isolated the Minister finds himself when fully engaged in the Committee, and he is thus cut off from communication with his colleagues, may I suggest that the Committee may wish to consider these amendments further. In particular, we may perhaps have the view of the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) which would give the Under-Secretary the opportunity to ascertain how far the conditions prevailing in Standing Committee G might also apply to this Committee?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. I am getting a little nauseated by the right hon. Gentleman. I wish that he would look after himself instead of putting words into other people's mouths. I am happy to continue; the Committee is happy to continue. I do not have to run into the corridors. I was a Whip for six years. I happened to be a Whip on the Bill when the dissolution of Parliament took place in February, when everyone in the Committee knew that Parliament would be prorogued. But this did not stop us carrying on with our work on the Bill until One o'clock. I suggest, Mrs. Jeger, that your ruling is right and that we continue with the business. I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his sympathy but I wish that he would look after himself more and leave us to look after ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who wishes to speak further to the amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have listened to the mover of the amendments and his supporters. One would think that the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee), when he was chairing his party, sat down one dark night in a mood of spite and spleen before being called to the bar of the assembly to account for of spite and spleen before being called to some of these things, and wrote this out.<br><br>
Hon. Gentlemen have forgotten that the hon. Member was the only Englishman on this Bill. One would think that no one from Northern Ireland took part in it. If the right hon. Gentleman looks—and I shall point it out to him because it is relevant—at the Appendices to the Working Party Report, he will see that three of those members were from the Regional Council of the Confederation of British Industry; two were from the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Trade; and five were from the Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. The words in this Bill, including the words in Schedule 3, were unanimously agreed by this body which has made clear its intentions to sign this Declaration—a Declaration, I might say, of Principle and Intent.<br><br>
What is wrong with anyone signing a Declaration of Principle and Intent in which he believed? I have listened and waited for someone to tell me this morning why, in a Northern Ireland context, an individual should not be able to say that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0099">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 171</span>
he will abide or will agree with the Declaration of Principle and Intent in which he believes.<br><br>
What is the objective of the amendment of the hon. Gentleman for Armagh (Mr. McCusker)? I have patiently sat here this morning. I only hope that some hon. Gentlemen will now let me say a few words. The hon. Gentleman moved his amendment this morning, saying that it was unnecessary to spell it out. The Government think that it is not only necessary but important to spell it out, and to get the Declaration of Intent.<br><br>
What does Amendment No. 28 do? It removes the provision for the declaration of commitment to the principle of equality of opportunity to be known as "The Declaration of Principle and Intent". Secondly, it removes the obligation placed on organisations representative of employers, of organisations of workers, and of persons engaged in occupations, to encourage their members to subscribe to the Declaration. It is important, and we think it is important that the existence of the declaration should become well-known, that it should attract publicity; and that it should carry a local and international standing. The working party believed that there would be decided advantages in there being a simple, unambiguous declaration affirming the duty of management to implement—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unambiguous?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I said unambiguous. We might have differences of opinion. I have sat and listened to the opinion of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) for some considerable time this morning. I only hope that he will allow me five minutes to put the answers to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will look after that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is obviously a need for such a declaration. Hon. Members opposite do not think it is necessary to spell it out. I have merely said that we think it is necessary to spell it out. Throughout their speeches this morning, hon. Gentlemen have kept referring to "the Government". It is, in effect, to a great extent, the agency, to which will be appointed men and women who have the confidence of both workers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 172</span>
and management, of people of all religious and political persuasions who have the ability to be conciliated, who have a wide knowledge of employment problems and practices, and who are prepared to take on what will be an arduous and difficult task.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
The Working Party has set us a problem. It cuts out a lot of people in Northern Ireland from becoming members of the agency. When these people have been appointed there will, from my experience of Northern Ireland, still be two or three bigots who will complain of whoever are chosen, but I hope that these men or women will be big enough to overcome that problem.<br><br>
The Government will not be policing this operation, but the agency will—which is where we come to Amendment No. 31. This will be left to the good sense and understanding of those in the agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is it that will be left to their good sense?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The agency. I am referring to Amendment No. 31. When the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends were wondering about the word "duty", and were word-splitting, they were saying "the Government" all the time. I am only pointing out that those in the agency will be people with understanding who will have the confidence of both sides in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think there must be a misunderstanding. I think we are referring to the words in line 36 onwards:
<br><blockquote><p>"… the Agency may require a declarant … to reaffirm … in such manner as the Agency may determine, …."</p></blockquote>
Surely the Under-Secretary is not declining to indicate what the Government—this is a Government Bill—mean by "in such manner", the differences of manner that they have in mind, and the scope which they think these words leave to the discretion of the agency? That is the Government's business.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When we appoint people to such an agency, surely it is only right that we should give them leeway, and allow them to exercise their common
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 173</span>
sense and judgment. If the agency decides that it needs affirmation of the words contained in the clause, all well and good; but firms can change hands, and circumstances can change. I am only saying that a lot of this work will be left to the good sense of the people who will be appointed to the agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it, for example, include—and the hon. Member must have taken advice on this; he cannot justify the wording unless he has—reaffirmation on oath?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The whole point of the agency is that it will all be voluntary. No one will be forced into it. As I have said, a lot of this will be left to the good sense and practice that will be built up by the agency. Everything will be entirely up to the Agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman confirming that under this wording the agency could require reaffirmation on oath? Of course, I appreciate that the making of the declaration is, in the peculiar sense defined, voluntary. But I am asking the hon. Gentleman about words that he is defending as part of an Act of Parliament. Would they or would they not, under "manner", include "on oath?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They could, but I have been saying all along that this will depend, to some extent, on the agency. It would be most unlikely, but I will not say that it could not happen. At the end of the day it is not for the Government, but for the agency. I do not want to reiterate the type of man or woman whom we consider should be the chairman and members of the agency. The words I used at the beginning meant, in the Northern Ireland context, that they will be very special people. This is a special task that they will be called upon to fulfil. There are plenty of people who will fulfil these roles, but we shall always have to expect the brickbats of a few bigots.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It certainly sounds as though they may be special people, but it sounds like a very special declaration in the schedule. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the agency can require a person to take an oath?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I am saying is that this will depend upon the agency, which, of course, has the duty, according to the Bill, to use its common sense and practice to good effect. It could not require the employees to take an oath which would have effect in a court of law—if that is what the hon. Gentleman means. But a great deal of latitude will be given to the agency. It will not be dictated to by the Minister. Once the agency is established, it will be given, as I say, a lot of latitude within the confines of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman mean that the agency may use its power to remove a name, or refuse to restore a name, to the register in order to bring pressure on some persons to take an oath?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman must understand what the agency is all about. We are going to put in it some very special people with special knowledge of Northern Ireland. We are not saying what they will do or what they will not do. Here is an agency consisting of special people with special knowledge of the situation in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The prospect of very special people with very special power, and the pressure to which they can expose one, is not very reassuring to hon. Members, who are a little worried. I ask the hon. Gentleman to address himself to the worries that have already been expressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If this had all been in the Minister's hands, I could have imagined the remarks that would have come from hon. Gentlemen. But when, in the first instance, we are to appoint men and women who have the confidence of workers and management of people of all religions—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do not Ministers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, they do. We listened for an hour this morning to the right hon. Gentlemen hair-splitting. Hon. Gentlemen opposite thoroughly misunderstand the conditions that appertain in Northern Ireland. It is all right for them to sit there, pink-faced and blue-eyed, as if nothing happens in Northern Ireland.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 175</span>
This has come from a Working Party of people who see the declaration as vitally important in matters of international understanding.<br><br>
The purpose of the Declaration of Principle and Intent is to seek an open commitment to the principles of equality of opportunity, the rejection of religious and political discrimination, and a commitment to apply these principles in practice. Organisations representing trade unions and employers as envisaged by the Working Party in signing the Declaration will undertake to encourage their members to subscribe to it.<br><br>
The Confederation of British Industries and the Northern Ireland Congress of Trade Unions, as well as other organisations, have indicated unequivocally their preference to do this. They have, in helping to draw this up, spoken on behalf of the membership in declaring in unequivocal terms that they prefer to sign this declaration of principle and intent.<br><br>
The provision for the declaration contained in the Bill is of a voluntary nature. It is hoped that it will result in a conscious and deliberate effort on the part of the people signing to secure equality of opportunity. There will, however, be no obligation to sign the declaration. They will be subject to investigation the agency in the same way as other persons or organisations within the scope of the Bill. Those found to have failed to comply with the terms of the declaration will be removed from the register and will thereby lose their right to the title "Equal Opportunity Employers" and would be liable to the same proceedings as anyone else who fails to secure equality of opportunity or who engages in unlawful discrimination. There will, however, be no legal sanctions to enforce the declaration. The Working Party unanimously agreed to the Declaration of Intent. Even going through the speech of the hon. Gentlemen, they would agree to the principle and the intent. The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) said that he did not think it necessary to spell it out. Both we and the members of the Working Party have decided that it is important to spell it out, and I am inviting the Committee to resist these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been a bad night for the Labour Party, but I do not see why the Under-Secretary should be so rough with the Committee. The right
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 176</span>
hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) was not, so far as I heard him, indulging in word-splitting; he was doing what has to be done in a Standing Committee, trying to ensure that the wording of the Bill is put in proper form. We shall get on much better if we can be a little more polite to each other across the floor of this Committee. We are delighted to have heard from the Under-Secretary and I hope that he will not mind if I add a few words to the debate.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Down, South is not the only hon. Member who is no lover of what I call public relations legislation, or one could say cosmetic legislation. Clause 6 is rather of that order. The clause provides a declaration to which employers, workers and others are to be encouraged, through their organisations, to subscribe.<br><br>
I should like to have one thing quite clear at the start from the Under-Secretary of State: what legal sanction has this declaration? Has it any legal force, or is it merely an expression of principle? The declaration of commitment to the principle of equality of opportunity, to be known as the Declaration of Principle and Intent, is set out in full in Schedule 3 and has been examined by the right hon. Member for Down, South. Speaking personally, if this declaration were in general, albiet loose, pompous and platitudinous terms, it would not do any harm, although I am not sure what practical benefit it would bring apart from making some people feel righteous.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
What worries me is that the declaration includes the utter rejection of discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion, and it is the very purpose of this Bill to render such discrimination unlawful. The declaration, therefore, amounts to a solemn affirmation of law-abidingness and non-criminality.<br><br>
I hope that before the debate on Clause 6 ends, we call get this straight. It is a textial and logical absurdity, and I am not persuaded that this is a sensible way in which to approach the largely decent and fair-minded people who employ and are employed in Northern Ireland. I ask the Under-Secretary to address himself to the legislative propriety of this. Perhaps he might wish to consider having the schedules redrafted before Report.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0102">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 177</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I am blue-eyed. I believe that technically, for Mendelian purposes, mankind is divided into only two categories, in which case I am blue-eyed, though the colour is green. It is the fault of the hon. Member who had to stray into these personal observations, but I do not think he can regard that as a comprehensive—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I took the hon. Gentleman's observations symbolically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, Mrs. Jeger, you will have an opportunity, in ruling on soje other point, to indicate symbolism, which I must say escaped me.<br><br>
Let there be no misapprehension, although there is on the part of the Under-Secretary a genuine misapprehension, that there is a most serious matter at stake here. He seems to think that because a recommendation has been made and agreed in certain terms by the bodies mentioned and by such a committee, therefore those terms are fit to be written into an Act of Parliament.<br><br>
To begin with, I cannot find that the committee recommended that this should be statutory. Perhaps they did and I overlooked it. Perhaps we should have some advice on this. As I read it, it says in the Summary of Main Conclusions on page 34:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government should invite representative organisations of employers …."</p></blockquote>
The Government do not require a statute to invite people to do this or that, so I do not think that even technically the hon. Member is right in praying in aid of this clause and this schedule the recommendations of the Committee.<br><br>
The next and much more important point is that, worthy though these people are—and undoubtedly worthy—it is not their business to decide what is fit to be written into an Act of Parliament. It is no good the hon. Member repeating over and over again what special people they were and that only one of them was English. The people who have the duty to decide what is fit to be in an Act of Parliament are first of all the Government with their advisers, who take sole responsibility for what they present to Parliament in the form of a Bill, and secondly, this House and at this stage this Committee. It is our business to be satisfied, and we cannot
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
defer to the supposed opinion of a body of admirable people who comprised the von Straubenzee Committee and say that this is what they wrote in their report and we have put it into an Act of Parliament.<br><br>
The hon. Member then asked what was wrong with it anyway. It is very disappointing if by now the hon. Member has not begun to get some inkling of what is wrong with it, as he was told in the plainest and briefest terms of an alternative approach by the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison), who said that it is wrong to invite a citizen in the terms of a statute to sign a declaration that he will not break the law. That is one of the things that is wrong with it, and there were others. Perhaps the hon. Member would like to have the leisure to read the Report of this Committee sitting and concentrate his mind upon the various objections that were raised.<br><br>
I am assuming that the hon. Member cannot do two things equally effectively at the same time, which was the reason for my brief pause.<br><br>
He then said that the fact of having signed the declaration would carry a local and international standing. I must say that he was understating the effect of the subsequent provisions of the Bill, to which we shall come. In that case, it ought not to be a condition of something which carries for a firm or a person local and international standing, to make an affirmation which many people would conscientiously object to making that, apart from the other terms, they have no intention of breaking the law as made by Parliament.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Member astonished more than myself by saying that it was unambiguous. He did not mean that, because he went on to say that he and I might disagree about what it meant. If he and I disagree about the natural meaning of it, I am afraid that he cannot at the same time say that it is unambiguous. That is one of the objections to the declaration as enshrined in the Bill, that it can include phrases and expressions of the utmost ambiguity, to which people are supposed to give their adherence, and which encapsulate not merely the ambiguities but the divisions that lie at the heart of our politics.<br><br>
We had to extract it from the hon. Gentleman with some difficulty, but then we came to his view of Clause 7 (2)<i>(a).</i> The hon. Gentleman had clearly not addressed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0103">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
his mind at all to what was meant by the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"in such manner as the Agency may determine".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman's attitude was, "This agency is good, chaps. It does not matter what powers it is given in an Act of Parliament, nor how those powers are defined." I tell the hon. Member that it does matter to the House of Commons what powers are given to other bodies. He seemed to think that it was an excuse to say that the agency is not the Government. At one point he said that he would begin to understand the objection if it was the Government who were asking for these things. On the contrary, at least the Government—<i>vide</i> some recent events—are responsible to the House of Commons. The Government can somehow be forced to debate, and can be called to account.<br><br>
The agency is a body one stage remote from accountability to the elected representatives of the people. So the very fact that the hon. Member could use such an argument shows how little he has conceived the objections which there are to this proposal.<br><br>
Since he places such weight on the recommendations of the Committee, I invite him to look again at Appendix 3. At the end it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Working Party recommends that the Government's unreserved commitment to the objects of the Declaration should be indicated in the following terms:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'The Government fully subscribes to this Declaration, whose aims it will seek to promote as an employer and in all other aspects of its own activity'."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member may reply, "We are doing so. We are giving evidence of it. We do not need to write it into an Act of Parliament. It is not suitable for going into an Act of Parliament. We are making it clear that we agree with the general aims and objects". That is not what the Working Party recommended. The Working Party recommended that the Government should take the same medicine that they are administering to others.<br><br>
If the hon. Member is going to say that because the Working Party has made the recommendation that all and sundry should sign this declaration that we have kicked into the Third Schedule to the Bill, and we must not inquire beyond what the Working Party advocated, I say "tit for tat" to the hon. Member. In that case the Government ought also to do it.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely we have gone much further than that. The terms of reference to the Working Party were to look at the private bodies. The Government have proposed to make it applicable to public bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: So the hon. Gentleman has stated that it is not appropriate to do by Act of Parliament what the Working Party recommended should be done. The Working Party recommended that
<br><blockquote><p>"the Government's unreserved commitment to the objects of the Declaration should be indicated in the following terms".</p></blockquote>
The terms are:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government fully subscribes to this Declaration."</p></blockquote>
Clearly the admirable people, the special people, who served on the van Straubenzee Committee, solemnly imagined that the Government would sit down—I suppose they had been refreshing their memories with the memoirs of Lord George-Brown and the Declaration of Intent at the end of 1964—and sign such a Declaration. The noble Lord quite rightly said, "That is not the way to go about it. The intention is right, but the method of going about it is wrong." I agree, and so is the method of going about putting this declaration of principle and intent into the Third Schedule, and making it a statutory duty of the agency to invite people to sign it.<br><br>
This is something which the hon. Gentleman, with the assistance of the senior Ministers in the Northern Ireland Department, must reconsider. Now we know that the agency is to have the power to administer oaths. Now the Under-Secretary has said, "Of course, they will not be statutory oaths", which appeared to relieve his mind inexpressively when he got the third note telling him that he had not read the previous note correctly. But it does not relieve our minds, that the agency is to be allowed to prescribe unlawful oaths to those who are to reaffirm this declaration.<br><br>
I do not want to awaken old echoes by the concept of an oath which is not a statutory oath. Unlawful oaths have a long history, not only in Great Britain but in Ireland. I shall leave that topic. But the issue we are talking about cannot be left where it stands. We shall return to the subject at a later stage. Unless we can persuade the Government now that

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 181</span>
they must reconsider the wording and the context of this declaration, on Report we shall plainly have to move amendments to ensure that the agency, admirable and special though it may be, is not in a position to prescribe oaths to declarants to the declaration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. Before you proceed further, may I remind you that you have twice refused motions of mine for the adjournment of the Committee, put on two separate points. I have a third separate point to make, to which I ask you and the Committee to give consideration. I told you that, in my own opinion and that of many others, the Government had lost the confidence of the House, and that this Bill should not be further considered for that reason.<br><br>
It has come to my notice that the Government are to move a motion of confidence this afternoon. Until that motion has been agreed to or otherwise by the House—we do not know what will be the position—I submit to you, Mrs. Jeger, that the strong arguments which I have already put before you for adjourning the Committee should be considered. That is particularly so when another Standing Committee has been adjourned</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I understand that an arrangement was made between a Member from this side of the Committee and the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) to pair with each other at 12.30 p.m.—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Pairing is not a matter for the Chair. I only helped the Committee by checking the time on the clock. Questions of pairing I cannot deal with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that a vote has been taken here is questionable in the circumstances.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 182</span>
<p>by a motion of the Government themselves on these grounds. Now that the Government are themselves asking for the confidence of the House it is unusual, to say the least, that we should continue consideration of a Bill when we do not know whether the Government will remain in office or whether they will implement the provisions of this Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is because we do not know the outcome of the Business of the House that I propose that we carry on as usual. I cannot accept a motion for the adjournment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. May I authoritatively be told the time, as I have been invited to pair with an hon. Gentleman at 12.30 p.m.?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The time is 12.29 p.m.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 29 in page 4, line 25, leave out subsection (3). <i>[Mr. Powell.]</i></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p>The <i>Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 5.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must trouble you with another point of order, Mrs. Jeger. You have dealt with points of order well this morning, but this is an important point of order. The Government have now been defeated on Amendment No. 29 and we must ask them for a statement of their intentions with regard to this Bill. In view of all that I have said about the further consideration of this Bill, I hope that they will bear this in mind. What do they intend to do in respect of consideration of this Bill, in view of the acceptance of the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, and without falling into the habit—</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0105">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that it is a point of order when an hon. Member addresses a question to another hon. Member. As far as order is concerned, I was about to put the Question "That Clause 6, as amended, stand part of the Bill".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there are hon. Members who would wish to address the Committee on the Question "That the Clause stand part of the Bill". Indeed, there were subjects which, in your wisdom, you had reserved for that point. With respect, it occurred to me that in view of the defeat of the Government on the last amendment, and the fact that the Third Schedule has fallen and cannot be part of the Bill, the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) thought, and I think, that for practical convenience we should hear from the Under-Secretary.<br><br>
For example, if the Under-Secretary were to rise and say that it was clear that the Government would need to reconsider the principle and drafting of the Third Schedule, clearly we would be able to make better progress in the "Clause stand part" debate. I appreciate that is is not a point of order and perhaps it should properly have been made on "Clause stand part"—but it seemed to me that the point raised by the hon. Member for Abingdon was entirely pertinent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When a Minister rises to address the Committee it is not a matter for me. It is quite normal, when an amendment has been disposed of, that the Committee proceeds to the next matter. I can do no more than propose the Question "That Clause 6, as amended, stand part of the Bill".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know you said that it was not for you, Mrs. Jeger, but it should have been apparent to the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) that I asked for the correct time because I wanted to known whether my pairing had begun. The answer was that it had not begun. We had embarked upon a Division, and the hon. Gentleman should have been here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order. The person involved was of the opinion—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot allow discussion on this matter. The question of pairing is not a matter for me.</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that perhaps it was not strictly a point of order that I raised, but—I am speaking to the Question "That Clause 6 stand part"—the Under-Secretary should make a statement on the amendment and on Schedule 3, as he has been advised to do by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell). This is very pertinent. It is entirely a matter for him to decide but I invite him to reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman now says that he was speaking to Clause 6, as amended, standing part of the Bill, which is what we are now debating However, it came to that stage, Members' voting intentions have nothing to do as you said, Mrs. Jeger, with you. Obviously we shall have to look at the repercussion of this vote and see what is now necessary within the confines of the Bill. All the arguments will have to be taken into consideration, and due weight will be given to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In some ways, it is extremely difficult to make a positive contribution in this debate on the clause because the declaration is so central to the clause. When the hon. Gentleman was justifying the declaration and the clause, he was almost taking us to a Dave Allen situation and saying, "The people who made this recommendation and those who drafted the declaration were all Irish except one. If there is any nonsense in it, you cannot blame the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee). It must have been those foolish Irishmen". The retort to that would be that they have scored to the extent that they have forced the Government to accept their nonsense. The justification given in the report for the declaration was that on other occasions it had been found that joint action by the TUC, the CBI, the Chamber of Commerce and the ICTU had had beneficial effects. The report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"There have been striking examples of the success achieved in keeping the adverse effects of sectarian divisions to a minimum in day-to-day industrial relationships."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0106">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 185</span>
That is in contrast to what the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) said last week, when he scoffed at our suggestion that the work place was an oasis of sanity, as I have described it. He said this was a nonsense. The headline in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"Fitt slams the idea of work place sanity"</p></blockquote>
did not do very much to improve industrial relations in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
It is interesting to note that the hon. Gentleman prefers to accept the views of the CBI when it advocates a declaration but not when it states, as it did in a letter to me last week, that strikes have been conspicuously absent on the shop floor. When the CBI and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce they appear to be advocating something which the hon. Member for Belfast, West accepts, that is one thing, but when they say something which he does not want to accept, that is a different matter.<br><br>
We are, therefore, in a situation where the Government are saying "Because these two bodies seem to have had such influence in the past seven years, if they make a recommendation to us, we are almost honour bound to accept it".<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) has highlighted in detail to the Committee the nonsense of the whole concept. I wonder why the Under-Secretary did not tell us why the Government did not take it as it stood. There are other substantial amendments to their declaration, quite apart from the omission which has been highlighted.<br><br>
Was that final paragraph put in not for the benefit of the Westminster Government but because it was felt in 1972 or 1973 that that would be implemented by a Northern Ireland Government? If it was to be implemented by a Northern Ireland Government, there would have been certain people sitting on the Committee which drafted the report who would have wanted to have laid it on the line. I wonder what the attitude of that power-sharing executive would have been to being forced to include that declaration.<br><br>
For this declaration to have been included, the Report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have reached unanimous agreement on the precise terms in which such a declaration should be phrased. These are contained in Appendix 3."</p></blockquote>
They consider the declaration to be simple and unambiguous. I hope the gentleman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 186</span>
who drafted it will take time to read the comments of my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South, who did us a service here in highlighting some of the difficulties and dangers inherent in the proposed wording.<br><br>
Who do these people represent? We are told that they are the voice of the employers and the workers in Northern Ireland. Last week, the Minister of State told us that there were half a million workers in Northern Ireland. Members opposite will be pleased to know that a substantially larger proportion of those workers are members of trade unions than there are in Great Britain-55 per cent. Of the 55 per cent., almost all are affiliated to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. But that leaves the Irish Congress of Trade Unions able to speak only for half of the workers of Northern Ireland. Of the 31,000 places of employment, the CBI and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce speak for only about 300 or 400 of them.<br><br>
If the Minister of State wants to cast aspersions on my efforts in producing a questionnaire which, as I admitted, was on a very restricted basis, he had better be careful that he applies the same argument to himself, because the bodies who produce the declaration do not speak for the whole of Northern Ireland. They do not speak for all the employers or for all the workers. One has to look at the declaration as a principle of intent which the CBI will sign in the light of its own comment which was given to the Committee earlier.<br><br>
The position of the CBI and the Chamber of Commerce has been consistent throughout. We have been sceptical of the efficacy of legislation to deal with the human problems involved in discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman be able to make available to members of the Committee his questionnaire and the replies thereto?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am quite prepared, taking account of certain obligations which I have to people who ask for confidentiality, to show it to any member of the Committee who wishes to see it. I will show him not only the questionnaire but the response to it and other correspondence I have received from people who did not complete the questionnaire.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0107">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 187</span>
We have a body representing the employers in Northern Ireland saying "Here is a declaration which we think will be useful. Here are the Government saying We will invite them to sign it.' We know in our hearts that they will sign it and say 'We must sign it because we have no alternative. We do not think it will be of any value, but we shall do it, anyway', and after all that is done, we shall go along to our members and encourage them to sign it as well." If that is the basis on which we are dealing with this legislation, we have to be sceptical about it.<br><br>
Do the Government want to embark on a whole procedure of signings and retractions, getting to the ludicrous situation of asking the employer to return it if he does not live up to their expectations?<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
Do we really believe that many of those 31,000 cases of employment will treasure this document and then, when they are naughty about how they offer equality of opportunity, be obliged to return it? Will there be any charge, I wonder, if it is not in the pristine condition in which it was issued? I would not have thought that we are doing anything here this morning to provide equality of opportunity by this nonsense. One cannot hum and haw widely on it because one does not know what form the declaration will take.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South mentioned the aspect of voluntary compulsion. That contradiction is not new to us in Northern Ireland. A few weeks ago, we were invited to consider voluntarily enforced coalition. We did not manage to work our way round that conundrum. I do not know whether we will be able to work our way round this one of voluntary compulsion, either. From time to time in the past two weeks allegations of humbug and hypocrisy have been bandied about by Government supporters. If signing a declaration is so vital and so valuable, how many of them moved amendments to the Race Relations Act suggesting that the same procedure should be implemented over here? Hon. Members need not give me the nonsense that it is not required when one reads that in some hon. Member's constituencies teenage coloured boys are six times more likely to be unemployed than white teenage boys. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 188</span>
this business of signing promises about one's behaviour is to be of any value in Northern Ireland where the problem, I can assure the Committee, is much more difficult than a black and white one, I should have thought that it might have had some validity in Great Britain. If that argument is being put, we shall look forward to seeing an amendment made to the Race Relations Bill as it is now before the House. I am quite sure that at least some of us on this side will be prepared to support it if we can be convinced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the purpose of taking part in this debate on Clause stand part, I express my opposition to the clause as it now stands after the amendment has been accepted. I should have wished to see the clause as it is in the Bill going on to the Statute Book unamended, and the declaration embodied in Schedule 3 becoming part of the legislation. I am again forced to the conclusion that hon. Members opposite, in trying to use reasonable arguments, are in effect doing everything they can to prevent this Bill from becoming law and becoming operational in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I am not certain whether the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) read out to the Committee this morning the wording of the declaration which we are discussing and which has been rejected by the Committee. I cannot see anything offensive in any employer giving the undertakings asked for in this declaration in the interests of good industrial relations and of killing off discrimination in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Down, South, says that employers should not be forced to sign such declarations—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are not forced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They should not even be helped or jollied along into signing such a declaration. He is in fact saying that if an employer does not allow himself to be jollied along—or coerced—into signing this declaration, in some way or other he will find himself in a less advantageous position when, as he said in a previous debate, it comes to the giving out of Government contracts, or anything that may affect the Government. I do not think that employers should be in any way reluctant about or inhibited from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0108">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 189</span>
signing such a reasonable declaration. At the moment, throughout the United Kingdom employers are looking around asking to sign certificates. I am not certain whether they go to ask to sign these certificates to put themselves in an advantageous position.<br><br>
We have seen in many advertisements suppliers of toilet paper to Her Majesty the Queen, suppliers of scent, of soap, or something or another. These advertisers have no hesitation in wanting their names put on that type of register, because they believe that it will put them in an advantageous position, in that they have supplied their products to the Royal Family.<br><br>
What is the difference? An employer wants to put himself in an advantageous position in relation to his competitors. This declaration is worded very reasonably. I cannot see how, after considerations, any employer interested in the welfare of his employees, in the society in which he lives, and in the geographical location of his industry, could take offence at the wording.<br><br>
By their opposition to this Bill, hon. Members opposite are indicating their acceptance of previous standards which have been laid down in Northern Ireland over many years. It is because those standards have prevailed for so long, and the attitude then taken by employers throughout Northern Ireland, that we had the onset of the present troubles. Although I do not say that the problems of discrimination in industry were solely responsible for the onset of the present troubles—there is no doubt that they had a great effect on the situation. The absence of employment, the frustration and feelings of victimisation because of a person's religion, all built up into a great bitterness and ultimately led to the present troubles.<br><br>
This clause, as it now stands, would take away from the Government the right to even request an employer to subscribe to these principles. Certainly there is no right to coerce or to force an employer, but one would have thought that employers in their own interest, that of society, and that of good relations, would have been lining up at the Agency and saying "We wish to append our names to such a document." I think that there are many employers in Northern Ireland who have indicated their intention of signing such a declaration.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 190</span>
I am not certain what steps the Government propose to take, but I hope that this declaration will once again become part of the legislation contained in the Bill. I see no objection to the wording. I believe that nothing but good can arise from the existence of the clause. But employers, far from showing any opposition, should be prepared to sign the declaration without any coercion or request to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Dunlop</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the few minutes left, Mrs. Jeger, I should like to commisertate with your goodself on your disability his morning. This is just a personal opinion, but I think it is a supreme calamity for any woman to lose her voice. We sympathise with you and hope that you will soon be well.<br><br>
This commitment has a wide umbrella and it covers employers, workers' organisations—which I take to mean trade unions—and occupations. I did a lot of thinking and heart-searching about the subtle differences between workers and occupations. I think however, that this commitment amounts almost to totalitarian pressure on employers and industrialists, and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) that a large proportion of employers and industrialists in Northern Ireland will jib at this commitment and the requirement to sign it.<br><br>
As for the workers and the trade unions, despite all the hot air that has been circulated today about how the trade unions are fully in accord with this, I can imagine what the reaction will be of trade unionists—and I am thinking about the fellows on the floor—to an explanation of this so-called commitment and the necessity to sign and commit oneself to such pressure. Their ordinary reaction will be strong. Indeed, I should not like to use the words that they might use.<br><br>
I ask the Under-Secretary to give some thought to occupations. I wonder whether the Royal Ulster Constabulary would come under this heading? How would they be required to give such an undertaking, and who would sign on their behalf? Would it be the chief constable or would it be the Minister of State in charge of Home Affairs? How would the police come under this? I was told on good authority by a senior police officer the other day that this has been completely eliminated from any questions put to any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0109">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 191</span>
would-be recruit to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. It would be interesting to hear how the police would be affected by this commitment.<br><br>
This is an attempt to legislate people into being good. It reminds me of the days of 1948 when we had the Beveridge Report which put out the ideal society for the British people and ushered in what we know as the Welfare State. But I heard one man make a pungent remark about that report. He said "This is an ideal", but he also said "You would need an ideal people to carry it out". We now know from years of experience that the ideal has slipped down in the minds and in the actions of many people.<br><br>
The Declaration of Intent as explained in Schedule 3 could, in all conscience, lead a prospective employer to engage a man in spite of his known religious beliefs or political opinions.<br><br>
In view of the time, Mrs. Jeger, I intend to conclude at this juncture by saying that I heartily believe that the imposition of this commitment on any organisation or on any would-employer will undoubtedly be detrimental to social justice and economic recovery and prosperity, even if it seems to be right and just.</span></p>

In relation to what the hon.
