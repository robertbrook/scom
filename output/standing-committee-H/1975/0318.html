<p><i>Question proposed—(16th March)</i> —That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I resume the remarks which I was directing to the Committee when we rose on Tuesday. I am glad to be relieved of anxiety that the Conservative Front Bench might be contemplating boycotting the Committee. I venture to express the hope that we shall have the advice of the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave), because although it was not in order that it should actually be called, the Conservative Party had indicated, by putting down an amendment to leave out Clause 11, that they shared the objections of my hon. Friends and myself to the clause standing part of the Bill. We may console ourselves with the thought that the hon. Member for Abingdon, in the HANSARDS which are now happily available, will be able to read our proceedings on Tuesday, just as we were able to read about his proceedings in another committee, reported perhaps slightly less reliably but in a more lively fashion, on the front page of <i>The Times.</i> I am sorry that the hon. Member is absent, and I intend no discourtesy to him.<br><br>
I now return to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) before we rose on Tuesday. The hon. Member for Belfast, West made clear that to him the idea of any continuing registration, recording or numerical taking into account of the religion of employees, was repugnant. I should have thought that in saying that, the hon. Gentleman was saying what must be true for all members of the Committee. Whatever may be the extent, described in the van Straubenzee Report as "some extent", of religious discrimination in Northern Ireland, what none of us wants is that it should be exacerbated by in-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
vestigations into religious persuasion which actually serve to highlight real or apparent discrepancies of which otherwise no one might have been conscious.<br><br>
That is the reason my hon. Friends and I take exception to, or doubt the wisdom of—perhaps I might put it that way—including the clause in the Bill. It is a very different thing for an agency like this to carry out on its own responsibility various investigations which it thinks appropriate and which it regards as conducive to the purposes for which it is established, and, on the other hand, for that agency to be specifically charged by statute with doing certain things. It is our contention that the terms of Clause 11 are such as virtually force the agency, and put it under an obligation even if it believes that to discharge it would be counter-productive, to undertake investigations which we believe will on balance be of an irritant and undesirable character.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to the first two words of the clause:
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of the Agency".</p></blockquote>
There is no question of "may" as opposed to "shall". The agency, reading its terms of reference in the Bill, whatever view it takes, whether it shares the views of the hon. Member for Belfast, West and myself, about the undesirability of lists of people of one religion and those of another religion, will find that it has a duty. What is that duty? It is to identify—I leave out for the moment the words "and keep under review", to which I shall presently return—patterns of employment in Northern Ireland for the purposes of
<br><blockquote><p>"… considering whether they reveal the existence or absence of equality of opportunity;"</p></blockquote>
which, as defined in Clause 3, relates to equality of opportunity as between those of different or no religious persuasions.<br><br>
Taking it no further than that, I seriously ask how it is possible for the agency to perform that function of establishing the initial pattern unless it will actually find out what are the religions of the persons employed and the persons obtaining employment in the various circumstances as set out in Clause 3. It surely could not be regarded as discharging the duty of identifying—and that is a precise word—patterns of employment unless it actually conducts, in some form or another, a census. Indeed, if it did not do that, it would be open to challenge: "Well you have identified patterns but where is your evidence? Are you going on hearsay?"</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0140">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 245</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman would address this question to his hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) who gave us a great deal of information on how to identify people in employment in parts of Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman is patient I will pray in aid presently the passage of arms which took place between my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) and the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt). I return to what I was saying. It is difficult to attach a meaning to a duty of identifying patterns of employment for the purpose of
<br><blockquote><p>"considering whether they reveal the existence or absence of equality of opportunity:"</p></blockquote>
as defined in Clause 3, unless there is to be statistical information at the base of it. Possibly the right hon. Gentleman will suggest alternative methods, and, since he has referred to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh, perhaps I may advert to possible alternative methods, though, I must admit, only to reject them at this stage.<br><br>
It is well known—and it was to that that my hon. Friend was referring—that in Northern Ireland, to a large extent, religion, or at any rate religious background, is deducible from surnames, and with a high degree of probability from Christian names. Inevitably, pledged and devoted as I am to the proposition that I shall make no differentiation in any respect between any of my constituents, I cannot help noticing with interest and concluding as I go round my constituency, calling upon my constituents, with a page of the register in front of me—as I did in my old constituency of Wolverhampton to amuse myself by noting the different incidence of Welsh names in that part—that "This is a street or a road where there is a preponderance of one religious affiliation or another."<br><br>
I cannot believe that it should be envisaged that in identifying patterns of employment and so on, the agency would be thought to be doing its duty if it relied upon such an indication, such as saying to a firm, "Can you give us the Christian names of your employees?" Only to go down the list picking out the Williamses and putting them on one side, and the Malachys and putting them on the other side. Even worse would be the proposition that the agency should rely upon what has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 246</span>
often been said in these debates, "Oh, we all know what is the religion of various workers."<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Armagh, in his speech on Second Reading gave a striking illustration from his own personal knowledge—and not merely his personal experience—as to how mistaken such assumptions can be. It would be intolerable that a statutory agency should identify patterns of employment in respect of equality of opportunity between the religions upon the basis of second-hand information or indications. I submit, therefore, that if this means anything—and if it does not mean anything we should not be putting it into a statute—it means statistical information, which must be based upon reliable interrogation and recording of religious affiliations.<br><br>
So much for identifying the patterns of employment. If that were all, we might be prepared to say "We do not like this, but the agency has got to have a starting point" and, perhaps, when we have looked at the pattern which it thus identifies, as we have all told the world, it will appear that the degree of real discrimination is relatively limited. So we may be willing to let pass the proposition that at the outset the agency should identify the pattern of employment in the way I have indicated.<br><br>
But that is not all. The agency is given a duty—and now I come to the other words—to
<br><blockquote><p>"keep under review … trends"</p></blockquote>
It cannot remain satisfied by saying "This was our starting point. This was the pattern that we established when we set up in business. We have worked within the terms of the statute; we have dealt with a number of cases of discrimination; we have used the Declaration of Intent; we have approached employers when we felt that all was not well, and we have to report year by year not only the detailed results of our work but our strong impression that, as a result, our work is reducing to some extent the religious discrimination in employment which existed". The agency is not to be allowed to do that.<br><br>
The agency is given a statutory duty to keep under review the trends. Again, if that means anything, it means that, having once done a survey, it is to be the duty of the agency to repeat that survey—and it must be repeated by the same method; it must be statistically comparable; otherwise it will be totally misleading—at regular intervals.<br><br>
I am reminded of another context of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0141">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 247</span>
which one might say that while one might envisage having a plebiscite or a referendum just once to establish a proposition, the notion of having periodic plebiscites or referenda is the recipe for chaos. Similarly, I put it to the Government that they are here asking for a periodical repetition of a form of survey which in itself is highly sensitive and open to grave objections. I do not know at what intervals the Government think it would be appropriate to pull up by the roots the plant of non-discrimination, the equal opportunity sapling, to see how it is getting on—not a very effective process of arboriculture. Perhaps five years?<br><br>
The trouble about a statutory duty to review is that the intervals tend to get shorter, that people tend to say "It is not good enough just to leave the thing for five years from the initial date. You have been given a statutory duty to review the trends, and you ought to provide us with a running commentary, as it were, of how equality of opportunity and the prevention of discrimination is proceeding".<br><br>
Therefore, this is an invitation—I withdraw that word, it is more than an "invitation"—this is a direction to the agency to carry out a survey of religion in employment and to carry out that survey at regular and possibly frequent intervals.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
What is more—and I am now referring to a point to which we shall come again in Clause 12—in paragraph (<i>b</i>)(ii) the agency is to carry out this survey with a view to proving a negative as well as an affirmative; to prove the absence of equality of opportunity as well as its existence. This is stated in paragraph (<i>a</i>) also. It is inconceivable that such an onus of proof could be discharged unless first of all there were a statistical layout of the religious affiliations of the employees in all but the smallest firms. Over and above that, there would be a searching investigation in each case to discover how far whatever might turn out to be the balance was due to nondiscriminatory factors—if I may so describe it—or due to the absence of equality of opportunity.<br><br>
Therefore, we are here imposing upon the agency, over and above the duty of conducting this statistical periodical survey, the duty of comment in detail upon it. It will be no use for the agency to establish the statistical pattern and say "We recognise, of course, that there are geographical fac-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
tors. There are craft, trade and other factors which come into it." They will have to explain and demonstrate that pattern case by case in order to discharge the duty which is laid upon it by the terms of the clause.<br><br>
I beg the right hon. Gentleman not to suppose that our objections to the clause and our insistence that the Committee shall address itself to the practical consequences of adding it to the Bill arise from any desire to obstruct the work of the agency. Whether or not it was wise to go in for that form of legislation, the agency is in the Bill, and we are concerned that the agency shall be assisted to do good and not be induced, let alone obliged, to do what it might judge to be harmful.<br><br>
I am aware of the temptation there is when one has a Bill like this which is based upon a report—not unlike another recent report of which I am reminded that even went to the point of virtually drafting the Bill itself. I understand what a temptation there is to both Government and Department alike to say "If we are going to have the Bill and all the palaver and business of getting a place in the programme for a Bill, let us make a substantial Bill of it. Let us not leave anything out. Let us formulate as many duties for the agency as we can." Therefore, a sort of Parkinson's Law applies to the multiplication of clauses once one has a Bill on the stocks. I am sure that it will be understood in quarters in which I am inaudible that I mean no criticism of the professional skill and integrity of the parliamentary draftsmen—either the Ulster or the United Kingdom parliamentary draftsmen.<br><br>
It is the Committee's business to say whether a clause presented to it does more harm than good. What I want the right hon. Gentleman to address his mind to is the simple proposition that there is nothing that this clause will oblige the agency to do that it could not under the rest of the Bill do perfectly well, albeit much more tactfully, conveniently, flexibly, and more in accordance with its own judgment and knowledge of the situation than is obligatory under this clause.<br><br>
We are adding nothing to the powers of the agency by this clause. We are, in fact, placing an obligation upon it. I remember one or two sittings ago when the Under-Secretary, lauding the independence and judgment of the agency, said that we do not need to be fearful of the good judgment which the members who will be appointed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0142">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
to the agency will bring to their task. I shall pray that in aid. I do not see why we should suppose that, having been set up for the purposes stated in the Bill, the agency will be deliberately blind either to the situation as it finds it, or to the progress which is being made as a result of its operations. It is obliged, in the report which it has to render to the Secretary of State, to form a view upon those subjects year by year.<br><br>
We can therefore safely trust the agency to use its judgment in establishing what facts it thinks necessary. One of the great advantages, if we leave it to the judgment of the agency, is that it will not be called upon—as it will inevitably be called upon as a result of its duties—to publish such statistics as it may accumulate.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman may say that there is nothing in the Bill about a duty to publish. I know there is not. But he and I both know the pressure that there would be exerted upon the agency to answer the question "How did you carry out your duty under Section 11 of the Act, and what were your initial findings?" We should discover that very soon the whole accumulation of data which had been acquired by the agency would be teased out and made public with the diverse, divergent and contradictory interpretations which would be put upon it.<br><br>
I know there are difficulties for a Government who have produced a measure and who have put a clause into a Bill to say goodbye to it at any stage. But I look forward to hearing the right hon. Gentleman show some—I am sure he has it—understanding of the fears of those who oppose this clause standing part of the Bill. We look forward with eagerness to hearing how he can reconcile the presence of this clause in the Bill with his frequently repeated assertion that no register will be kept of religious beliefs or affiliations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take only a few moments to highlight some of the inconsistencies which exist between the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) and his Unionist colleague in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
There is one point on which I shall agree with the right hon. Gentleman. It is distasteful to have to embark on an exercise of finding out whether or not there is, or has been, discrimination in the past in industrial centres throughout Northern Ireland. The right hon. Gentleman is opposed to that, and in this connection I would not include him with Unionist representatives from
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
Northern Ireland. The right hon. Gentleman has not had the experience that we have had there—the bitter experience which has led to the formulation of this Bill.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman tried to imply that in compiling this register, my right hon. Friend will have to engage in the exercise of compiling the religious denominations of people employed in different industrial establishments. But those patterns are already well established and have been well established over a number of years. There is no one in Northern Ireland who does not know to a reasonable degree what is the exact religious composition of any of the work force in any industrial establishment.<br><br>
This can be proven by what happened during our last sitting of this Committee, when the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) was able to name people employed by the Newry and Mourne District Council, the implication being that they were Catholics. I interjected, Mrs. Jeger, on your advice. I asked the hon. Gentleman:
<br><blockquote><p>"How does the hon. Gentleman know?"</p></blockquote>
and he replied:
<br><blockquote><p>"I asked a member of the council to confirm it to me."</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>—OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee H,</i> 16th March 1976, c.236.</p></blockquote>
So he already knew, and was seeking confirmation from the member of the council, or he went to the member of the council, not having any information himself, and asked the religious affiliation of the men concerned.<br><br>
That is an indication that a member of the council knew the religious affiliation of those officers of the council. The hon. Gentleman then went much further and picked out the Derry Council. It is well known in Northern Ireland that both Newry and Mourne District Council and Derry Council are not controlled by the Loyalist or Unionist parties, so it can readily be seen why these two councils were picked out. But we must be logical about this. If the hon. Member for Armagh is saying, "Here are two councils controlled by the minority or the Catholics" and there is discrimination in favour of Catholics being employed by those councils, to use that same logic it must be reasonable to suggest that all the other local authorities in Northern Ireland, which are controlled either by the Loyalists or the Unionist Party, must be indulging in the same practice.<br><br>
The words of the hon. Gentleman have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0143">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
confirmed what we know in Northern Ireland, that it is well-known that patterns are clearly established, and this legislation is to break down the patterns and claims of discrimination which have existed for so many years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Member explain how he thinks that the agency is going to identify those patterns? Does one gather that he thinks it will sit back and jot them down from common report, as I believe the expression is, or does he believe it will be based upon second-hand inquiries such as the hon. Member accused my hon. Friend of? How does he think it is going to fulfil this duty?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman wants to take the easy way out and to follow the agency under the direction of my right hon. Friend—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is not a question of academics. If the agency wants to discover the religious affiliation of people employed in Newry and Mourne District Council, it could take the advice of the hon. Member for Armagh as town councillor there. He was prepared to accept the answer given by a member of Newry and Mourne District Council, and was also prepared to accept this information from someone in Derry as well. So the information will be readily available. It is available now because we in Northern Ireland know, and can identify, the industrial establishments.<br><br>
Although the right hon. Member for Down, South makes no difference between the various religions in Northern Ireland, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist, and so on, that is not where the problem lies. It lies between the majority Protestant community and the minority Catholic community.<br><br>
During a recent sitting of this Committee, the hon. Gentleman asked if a Socinian could be subjected to discrimination in Northern Ireland, and the questions that he would be asked. If someone applied for a job and listed his religion as being Socinian, the employer would say to him, "Are you a Catholic Socinian or a Protestant Socinian?". That is the reality of Northern Ireland. It is between the majority and the minority religions. The patterns are there at present, clearly identifiable, and the agency
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
will have no difficulty in finding out the true position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is going to vote against the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert J. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Much has been made today of the duty incumbent upon the agency to keep a registration of religious affiliation, and rightly so. Although the right hon. Gentleman and some of his colleagues have sometimes sought to evade the reality of the situation, the fact is that some of those—and I refer to the trade union movement—whose assent and co-operation he has called to his aid, believe registration to be necessary.<br><br>
At a meeting with the trade union movement not long ago, the trade unions were clear about this. They were quite unambiguous. They felt that registers would have to be kept and, indeed, a very prominent trade union has asked why there is opposition to this, because in many walks of life registers of religious affiliation already are kept and, indeed, are helpful and necessary. I fear that I detect a recourse to deliberate ambiguity by the Government when they face the reality of keeping registers.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) believes that it is already possible to identify religious affiliations, patterns and trends in employment in Northern Ireland, but he did not answer the very pertinent and proper question "Why then has the agency been given this responsibility, which is the fundamental responsibility on which all its other functions are based and from which all its other functions will proceed?" That question was left unanswered.<br><br>
If it is the fact that patterns and trends of religious affiliation are identifiable, then it is so for two reasons. Among those two reasons I cannot find, and will not include, a crass, deliberate, vindictive attitude of religious discrimination. The first reason is, the importance of geographical location of industry. The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) has previously clarified that element to a degree beyond any contradiction. It is a fact of life that in Northern Ireland industries have been created which have drawn their work force from particular areas, and people have been glad to work there. There has been no ferreting out of either religious or even political affiliations. There has merely been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0144">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
a desire to get on with the job and produce a commodity which would advantage the economy of the Province.<br><br>
Those hon. Members who try to import into the debate an almost Satanic degree of desire for discrimination are doing a great disservice to industry in Northern Ireland, industry which is based—we admit it—on both sides of the community and operated by people who plainly identify themselves with either side of the religious community.<br><br>
Linked with the factor of geographical location is the all-important feature of a reluctance to travel, which is more evident in Northern Ireland than in the United Kingdom, if not peculiar to it. There is great reluctance to travel to employment, which has not been stressed to the degree that it merits.<br><br>
I had a conversation with an industrialist a few days ago. He required 61 workers immediately in his factory—and incidentally this man offers employment opportunities to members across the religious divide—and after interviewing 59 applicants he got five. The main reason was that people were not prepared to travel. He was not concerned about their religious denomination because he was so frenzied about getting only five employees when he needed 61 workers. Imagine the embarrassing situation if we imposed upon all those difficulties a process which would resort to ferreting out one person's religion from that of another.<br><br>
I turn now to my second point, and I realise that this will be fairly controversial. However, it is a view which I share sincerely and one which I hope I share without any desire to cause concern or heartache. Another reason for the already apparent pattern and trend in Northern Ireland is that the minority community have suffered drastically at the hands of their own religious system. There has been little or no encouragement since the inception of the state in Northern Ireland for an improvement in the standard of living. There has been no encouragement to embark on apprenticeship courses. In fact, the system which is largely represented in the minority community has worked to deprive people in that community of the opportunities to embark on training courses which in the early stages of our State not only did not receive a wage but courses which had to be paid for if one was at the end of the day to obtain a trade or professional skill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make this small inter-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
jection. The hon. Gentleman said that he is making what is probably a controversial point. I think I should make it clear to the hon. Gentleman that—and no one person speaks for any religion—at a recent meeting at which the Prime Minister and I were present, Cardinal Conway asked what action was being taken in Northern Ireland to ensure that people of all religious denominations received a proper training and apprenticeship.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that interjection because I want to make the point that at the present time it is abundantly clear that that sort of mentality and "leadership"—in inverted commas—no longer exists. We thank God for that. But we must remember that 50 years is not a long time in the evolution of the State. To talk about an endemic desire to discriminate on the basis of religion cannot fully be understood—if it can be understood at all—without realising the attitude which existed so far as the Roman Catholic hierarchy were concerned in the early days of the inception of the State in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I finish by making the point which I tried to make when we were discussing the previous clause. A consistent application of this unwieldy and unhelpful legislation will, I believe, soon create havoc. If this Bill is passed without much amendment, I am tempted to say that the sooner that havoc is created the better. Then we shall have some hope of hastening an amending process which will make damaging legislation less damaging in the interest of employment in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal with a valid comment made at our previous sitting by the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) about quotas. I want to say something on that topic in the terms of the clause. I know the hon. Gentleman's anxiety, and I hope that I can allay some of his fears.<br><br>
I turn to the central argument put by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), who, with his customary parly skill, tried to persuade the Committee, and not least the Government, that the clause is unnecessary. The stronger the right hon. Gentleman made his case, the more evident it became that the clause was necessary. The clause paves the way for subsequent clauses on the operation of the agency, and in effect, it lays down the terms of reference from which the agency will operate. When
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0145">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
we reach Clause 12 I suggest that that will become even clearer.<br><br>
Therefore, not only is this clause necessary so far as the Government are concerned, but it is essential and right. It lays down, as the right hon. Gentleman said, the manner in which the agency should operate to obtain patterns and trends of employment in Northern Ireland. When we talk about patterns and trends, both must be studied. We cannot deal with one factor on its own. The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) referred, for example, to the question of patterns which are established due to the nature of where people live; perhaps the fact that some people will not travel to work or are fearful of travelling. An area may be solely Roman Catholic and, because of that, only Roman Catholic people are employed there. The same could be true of a Protestant area.<br><br>
When it assesses patterns, therefore, that does not mean that the agency will have to establish that its decision will be taken on that basis alone. It must take into account trends, and how those trends have operated in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly worried about the use of the word "trends" in making the point about location, because the precise wording of the clause is "trends of employment", not trends of behaviourism in Northern Ireland. I consider that the distinction must be drawn and observed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to make a clear distinction between patterns, which is one factor, and trends, which is another. They may coincide at certain points, but we might have patterns established which in a particular firm, for instance, could prove that those patterns meant that it was natural that people of one religion or another should be employed there. But in a firm nearby, the trends might show that that firm could be more open.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) said that it will be the duty of the Government and the Minister, whereas it will be the duty of the agency after the Bill is enacted. In consequence, one of the factors that will tax the mind of the Government and their Ministers in appointing people to the agency will be to find fair-minded people. I do not accept the argument that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
there are not people in both communities who can be both fair-minded and courageous in Northern Ireland. It will be the Government's task to find people to operate the clause and subsequent clauses in a manner that will not lead to trouble and the difficulties that might flow from it.<br><br>
It may be interesting for the Committee to note that when the hon. Member for Armagh gave his figures—however he may have found those figures out—it did not cause a revolution in Northern Ireland. My hon. Friend for Belfast, West said that they are well-known anyway. But the hon. Member for Armagh found those figures out and gave them to the Committee. It is not so much that he gave out figures, but rather that he did something which the Bill will not do. He named people and their religion. On reflection, I hope that he will feel that he has done a disservice by naming people, as he has done, because under this Bill individuals, as such, will not be named. Obviously information will need to be obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That will be a matter for the agency. There are many simple ways—for example, in the same way as his hon. Friend went out and found information. The agency can ask employers and it can look at books. We shall be dealing with intelligent people who will operate this Bill in an intelligent manner.<br><br>
I turn to the question raised by the hon. Member for Epping Forest who, when he expressed the concern of his Conservative colleagues and himself about the question of quotas, asked whether it would lead to quotas. I say to the hon. Gentleman—and I hope that this meets his point—that in the guidelines which will be issued to firms, an explicit point will be made not to arrange a pattern based on quotas, as quotas will not be used as a judgment. They will therefore, not have to consider quotas.<br><br>
Much of the argument about quotas is destroyed when we hear arguments about patterns, trends and the other problems that must be taken into account. The Government have firmly rejected the two-thirds/one-third concept. It will not work in any form of employment, as we see it. It must be done on a basis of a person having equal opportunity—that is what this Bill is about—and not on quotas. I make that point as strongly as possible to the hon. Gentleman, in the hope that he will feel more satisfied. Thus when we move on to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0146">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
Clause 12 we can discuss some more of the detail. This is paving the way to Clause 12 and subsequent clauses. I therefore ask the Committee to accept Clause 11.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister assured us that this clause was necessary and, indeed, essential. It paves the way and gives the terms of reference to the agency. He laid considerable emphasis on the determining of patterns and trends. But the determining of patterns and trends is secondary in the clause, because it is what the determining of those patterns and trends leads to that is important. The patterns and trends must be distinguished to establish whether or not there is equality of opportunity.<br><br>
I think the Minister was perhaps rather misleading in this respect. The patterns and trends in themselves are not particularly desirable. They are being investigated to establish whether there is an absence of equality of opportunity. When we move to Clause 12, as the Minister has said, we shall be considering the argument on that issue.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) said, it establishes a duty on this agency, of its own volition, to look into the religious compositions of various groups of employees in Northern Ireland. We on this side of the Committee have continually tried to highlight the distasteful nature of this practice.<br><br>
The committee which drew up the report did not find anything distasteful about that and it was categoric in stating that it was essential. In paragraph 126, for example, it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"We regard it as essential for the Agency, if it is to do its job effectively, to obtain information concerning religious affiliation. It will need this information at individual company level in order to establish and appraise employment patterns which will help it to identify the existence of discriminatory practices: … Information will also be needed on a wider basis in order that the Agency may fulfil its responsibilities concerning the examination of overall employment patterns and the discernment of practices which …"</p></blockquote>
lead to discrimination and so on. We are faced with this duty laid upon the agency to draw up lists, no matter how it may be done. I have shown what I consider to be the only way it can do it, namely, to get down to the individual and say, "What is his religion?"<br><br>
The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) implied that I had done something underhand in submitting the list of names last week. The names I mentioned are published in the handbook for public representatives
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
of the Housing Executive. It is available to everyone. The hon. Gentleman can see the list of names in it. The local district councils publish the names of the principal officers.<br><br>
I picked the examples of the two councils. I did not select the officers in any particular way. They are the senior salaried officials in those two local district councils. As has frequently been stated, particularly with regard to public employees in areas such as Newry and Londonderry, it is not difficult to establish what the religious affiliations are. But the insinuation has been made that by naming these people I was damaging them or accusing them of something. As I have said, the names are already well-established and well-documented in various handbooks and lists of employment.<br><br>
The fact that we have made an assumption regarding religious affiliation does not accuse those employees of being guilty of gross discrimination. They occupy particular positions and the reason I mentioned them was to show the distasteful nature of what we are discussing.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Belfast, West said that he could discern hatred in my comments, and I suppose he was inferring there was a hatred of the people I was naming. If there was hatred in my demeanour or in my comments, it was hatred of the necessity to involve ourselves in this listing and naming and cataloguing of religions.<br><br>
Perhaps the most interesting observations in the van Straubenzee Report regarding this practice was one which the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Mr. Litterick) would appreciate. Justification for it appears in paragraph 131 of the report.
<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency would provide a data collection facility for employers who wished themselves to have information about religious affiliations as a management tool."</p></blockquote>
So we now have justification for the agency keeping and reviewing lists of religious affiliations. Surely somehow or other management will make approaches to it to obtain this information, albeit on a global basis—the term used by the Minister on a previous occasion—to use as a management tool.<br><br>
I hope that before we leave this clause the Minister will tell us how he thinks this information could possibly be used as a management tool if it does not, by some means or other, entail what we do not want to call quotas, but some means of rectifying the balance.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 259</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is very tantalising to conclude this debate on the clause with the feeling that there is so much in common in intention and in appreciation of a situation between the right hon. Gentleman and others on the Government Benches, and my hon. Friends and myself, and yet we do not seem to be able to break through the barrier which is presented—probably by the wording; I am not sure—of this clause.<br><br>
I shall take briefly the three main points which the Minister of State put. He said that the clause paves the way for the business end in Clause 12. One is in some difficulty here without anticipating amendments and debates on Clause 12. I content myself by saying that we do not believe that in order to make Clause 12 effective for the working machinery of the Bill, it is necessary for Clause 12 to include the elements, which, I imagine, are Clause 12(1)(<i>a</i>), which raise our anxieties in Clause 11. In other words, I am saying to the right hon. Gentleman that his Clause 12 also will be better for lacking the elements, and the only elements, for which it is dependent upon the existence of the embracing duty in Clause 11. We shall be arguing that everything which ought to be done, everything which we would want to see done under Clause 12, can be done under the powers and duties of the agency, irrespective of Clause 11.<br><br>
I now come to the right hon. Gentleman's remarks concerning patterns and trends. As he spoke, I wondered whether one had understood the extreme difficulty of patterns and trends in this clause. He seemed to say that "pattern" meant the factual pattern which has been established as a result of all the factors, desirable and undesirable, working up to the present moment, whereas the trends were what emerged from the undesirable factors, the factors against which the Bill is directed.<br><br>
As I understood the right hon. Gentleman, he was deducing from that view of the clause that all it meant was that the agency would have to sort out the various factors at work in establishing a pattern of employment in order to isolate the factors against which this Bill is aimed.<br><br>
I have been doing my best to understand the right hon. Gentleman's interpretation to the Committee. If that is what the clause is intended to do, I do not think that my hon. Friends and I have any objection to that purpose, as obviously the agency will need—and if it has not sufficient in-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
telligence it must be told—to isolate genuine discrimination, if I may be permitted the rough expression, from all the other factors which result in statistical imbalance.<br><br>
I am making this appeal to the right hon. Gentleman in the hope that I have understood him correctly. If that is what this clause intends, whilst identifying and keeping under review patterns and trends, if it means disentanglement from all the other factors which operate upon employment, those with which the Bill is concerned, my hon. Friends and I would not wish to keep such a provision out of the Bill. But we would say that if, after several intensive readings, it was only when he rose to speak that that significance of the clause emerged, it will not be beyond the capabilities of the right hon. Gentleman and his advisers and the parliamentary draftsmen to substitute a clause which has that plain meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman allow me to say that the purpose of identifying patterns and trends—and "patterns" takes into account historical patterns of living, training and so forth—is still to eradicate discrimination where it exists, despite the patterns and trends that flow from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say that this gets better as we go on. The right hon. Gentleman is casting a new light on the clause. He is saying—and I take his last intervention—that it is the business of the agency to understand and to assess the non-discriminatory factors, and to assess both the discriminatory and the nondiscriminatory factors which have operated in order to produce things as they are, as a basis for separating the sheep from the goats.<br><br>
I say that as an earnest of our wish to cooperate in the Bill and to make the best sense possible. If the right hon. Gentleman can put in statutory language what he just said to the Committee in his intervention, I am sure that I am speaking for my hon. Friends—and, I hope, for others—when I say that we would consider it a great improvement to the Bill and that it would remove much misunderstanding.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
Finally, I deal with the misunderstandings and anxieties which it would remove. I illustrate them with words which the right hon. Gentleman used. In answer to my hon.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0148">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
Friend's question of how the agency would find out the pattern, he said that it would ask employers and look at books. By using that phrase, I am afraid that he took us straight into the thicket of our most tense anxieties.<br><br>
I take the right hon. Gentleman's statement in two halves. First, to ask employers. Obviously, for the enforcement provisions of the Bill—and I entirely accept this—if the agency is going to establish a specific case in which it believes that something is wrong, it is going to find out whether it is wrong or not. If it is wrong and if its opinion is to go through the machinery of the Act, obviously it will have to ask the employers. The agency has to establish in that particular case the religious affiliations of certain persons—I am not disputing that—for instance, persons who were refused a job. Nobody can deny that.<br><br>
However, what the clause as it stands suggests is that there will be a general duty upon the agency at the start to ask all employers to report so that it can establish the pattern. I hope that that is wrong. I hope that the explanation of the meaning of "pattern" which the Minister gave is the reason why is it wrong. But he must admit that on the face of the Bill there is ground for believing it.<br><br>
I turn to the second half—looking at the books. The right hon. Gentleman must realise that our anxieties are increased by the wording of the report of the working party chaired by the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) and the paragraphs to which my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) referred. We have the inestimable benefit of the presence of the hon. Member, and may I say how nice it is once in a while to see a "bishop" wearing his lawn sleeves. I hope that as the Chairman of the working party he will give us the benefit of his authentic evidence on what these passages mean. However, if we are to be left without illumination from that side, we shall have to do our poor best with the wording.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred to the fact that the report clearly envisaged that a whole system of recording, through employers, of religious affiliation and religious balance was what was actually aimed at. If the Minister of State, in accordance with what he said earlier, can separate in our minds what his intention is in this clause from the quite extraordinary elaboration of recording which is envisaged in paragraphs 126 to 133 of the working party report, our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
minds will be greatly relieved. It is precisely that kind of across-the-board recording, not required under Schedule 5 but pressed upon employers in pursuance of its duty under this clause by the agency, which excites our anxiety.<br><br>
I conclude with the crucial reason, referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh, why it excites our anxiety. The right hon. Gentleman said that he firmly-rejected the two-thirds/one-third concept. "Amen" say all of us. But once one gets down to the recording of percentages: 63, 67, 81 or 87 per cent. one way or the other—that is how it will be represented—and this applies to recruitment as well as actual employment, then in practice it is not going to be possible to avoid gravitating towards what the right hon. Gentleman does not want and what we do not want.<br><br>
Imagine the position of the employer taking on staff in such a case as was mentioned earlier, who knows that the balance in his firm is not two-thirds/one-third, for whatever reason. There will be an extremely strong temptation and pressure, under the influence of that type of recording, to say "I have to get something nearer to a system which on some crass numerical basis I shall be able to justify." Therefore, what we say to the right hon. Gentleman is that this clause, as it stands, will take him right where he does not want to go, where he detests the idea of going, and so do we. My hon. Friends and I must record our objection to the clause as it stands.<br><br>
I conclude by appealing to the right hon. Gentleman, in the light of his own words in explanation of the clause, to resolve—I know the difficulty of precise undertakings and I would not wish to inveigle him on to that ground, and it is crucial that we debate this matter again—that he is going to have here, instead of what stands in the Bill at present, a clause which carries out his intention to establish the causes and factors at work in the present situation as a basis for the agency's work. If that is the meaning—that they are to be kept under review—we shall be quite happy at a later stage when such wording comes forward to support it. I make that appeal to the right hon. Gentleman.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 76, in page 8, leave out lines 4 and 5.<br><br>
We are with this amendment coming back in a more precise context to some of the matters which have been debated in the past hour or so of the committee's proceedings.<br><br>
I shall therefore put to the right hon. Gentleman as briefly as I can the link, as we see it, between the subsection and what we found objectionable in Clause 11 as it stands, not as it was re-interpreted, I hope correctly, by the right hon. Gentleman. I hope that it was that re-interpretation which resulted in the U-turn by Conservative Members, although it may be that they do it purely from habit now and that it is just a reflex action.<br><br>
The proposal is to leave out paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (1). Two purposes are set out in subsection (1) for the investigations with which the rest of the clause deals and on to which the enforcement provisions of following clauses are hooked.<br><br>
The second purpose, set out in paragraph (<i>b</i>), appears to be perfectly satisfactory and sufficient. It seems right that, if the agency considers that action should be taken to secure equality of opportunity by any of the persons set out in the subsection, where it is assumed that <i>prima facie</i> that situation does not exist, the following provisions should have effect. We do not accept that the agency should have these powers and duties and that the enginery should be brought into action for the general 100 per cent. across-the-board Clause 11 type purpose set out in paragraph (<i>a</i>).<br><br>
As we read paragraph (<i>a</i>), it seems—I am afraid this was seen to be and confirmed by the right hon. Gentleman's reference to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
Clause 11 as a paving for Clause 12—not to be
<br><blockquote><p>"ascertaining the existence, nature and extent"</p></blockquote>
of particular failures, to which the action mentioned in paragraph (<i>b</i>) would be a sequel, but of ascertaining the nature and extent of any failures which might exist throughout Northern Ireland. In other words, we see paragraph (<i>a</i>) as the machinery for fulfilling our worst fears as to the universal registration and re-registration, recording, and statistical investigation which we apprehended lay behind Clause 11.<br><br>
First, will the right hon. Gentleman make clear that the intention is that the failures are failures in a particular case and are thus closely related with and married to paragraph (<i>b</i>)? Secondly, will he undertake to consider whether, if that is the intention, it can be made clearer than it is now? The term "failures" appears to be a general use of the word and to mean any possible failures which might occur anywhere. In that event, I should not seek to press the amendment. I hope that the Minister will provide that explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In reply to the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), I should point out that paragraph (<i>a</i>) in subsection (1) is essential, so that, in deciding what action should be taken to secure the equality of opportunity, the agency may first ascertain whether any failure exists to provide such opportunity. If it finds failure, the agency has to try to establish the nature of that failure. It might result from the practices of one of the persons to whom paragraph (<i>b</i>) refers. The agency needs to establish the extent of such failure and whether it is sufficiently serious to warrant action being taken. I hope that explanation satisfies the right hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister and I hope that we can now make progress. If I understood him correctly, putting it in my layman's language, "failures" means failures in particular cases. I do not imagine that one can draft on one's feet—indeed, it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0150">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
is not given to us poor mortals to draft at all—but the right hon. Gentleman has understood my meaning. I therefore ask him to give the further assurance to the Committee, before I withdraw the amendment, that he will satisfy himself that the word "failures", as used in the subsection, is not ambiguous and that it is linked in a manner which, in the right hon. Gentleman's concluding words, means that paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are part of the same individual case investigation. In that event it would be necessary, in order to decide what action should be taken, to decide the nature and extent of the failure.<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman will undertake to look at the wording from that point of view to bring it indubitably into line with his explanation, I shall be happy that we should make progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right in his definition. It deals with the specific point that he raised. I think that the Bill is clear on this matter, but I shall certainly consult my advisers whether it is necessary to amend it. I give the assurance that the interpretation is as the right hon. Gentleman stated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 79, in page 9, line 7, leave out 'that class' and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'any class referred to in paragraph <i>(a)'</i>.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will allow me to interject to say that the Government will be pleased to accept that amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not often that it is given to us poor mortals to score off the draftsman, which I suspect may be what has happened in this case. I hope that the Minister will take our attention to detail as evidence of our desire to improve the Bill. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 78, in page <b>9,</b> line <b>16,</b> at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'(3) Nothing in this section shall be taken to require any person concerned to make or maintain any register or record of the religious profession of any other persons or class of persons'.</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
The amendment hardly requires any elaboration by me. This matter has exercised our minds and worried us since the Committee first met. Our antagonism towards the proposal is well known. We have argued consistently against the possibility that its inclusion in the clause meant that there might be forces at work which would compel a person to do what is proposed.<br><br>
I want briefly to refer once more to other work which I undertook which relates specifically to the amendment. I hope that the Minister of State will not again cast aspersions on my efforts to get to the bottom of what people in Northern Ireland feel about this matter. I have had replies from more than 80 companies, and in only one of those replies, which was from a shop steward, was there any indication that it was felt that the keeping of a register would assist in providing equality of opportunity. The CBI and the Northern Ireland Chamber of Trade and Industry have indicated to me that they would advise their members against keeping such a register, even if the provision were contained in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I could help the hon. Gentleman on the matter. I am trying to be helpful to the Committee. If the hon. Gentleman's amendment is designed to ensure that the agency will not have the power:
<br><blockquote><p>"to require any person concerned to make or maintain any register or record of religious profession of any other persons or class of persons".</p></blockquote>
it is unnecessary, because there is no such provision in Clause 12 or in any other part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only thing that concerns us is that Clause 12 and Schedule 5—we cannot discuss Clause 12 without referring to Schedule 5—empower the agency to require people to produce certain information. Being empowering in that way, the agency could, if it so desired, say to an employer "Produce a register of the names and religious affiliations of your employees". Hon. Gentlemen opposite are shaking their heads, but paragraph 8(1) of Schedule 5 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of the investigation the Agency may require any person who in its opinion is able to furnish information or produce documents relevant to the investigation to furnish any such information or produce any such document."</p></blockquote>
I know that later there is protection for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0151">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
the individual against disclosure of his religious belief, but the individual would not be asked to disclose his religious belief. A third person, the employer, who would perhaps know the religious belief of the employee, would be asked and protection does not exist for that third person. If the agency in pursuit of its investigations required a particular employer to produce a list of employees and their religious affiliations, I should have thought it would be so empowered under paragraph 8.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I again help the hon. Gentleman here? Schedule 5 is germane to this clause and, again, while the agency can compel people to give information on a collective basis, as it were, it cannot compel a person to state his religion, nor can it compel an organisation or body to keep a register. There is no power to do that, as I have explained, either in Clause 12 or in Schedule 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am still somewhat confused. While I accept that there is protection in paragraph (3), which states,
<br><blockquote><p>"A person shall not be compelled for the purposes of the investigation—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>a</i>) to give any information or produce any document which"</p></blockquote>
discloses, or from which can be deduced his religious belief, I do not think that it protects a third person from being asked to disclose the religious belief of another. I still argue—perhaps the Minister can convince me otherwise—that Schedule 5, 8(1) could empower the agency if it so desired to require that information. Paragraph 8(1).
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of the investigation the Agency may require any person who in its opinion is able to furnish information or produce documents relevant to the investigation to furnish any such information or produce any such document."</p></blockquote>
That document or information could take the form of the agency saying to an employer "I want a list of your employees showing their religious affiliations".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The protection of Schedule 5 is clear enough, and what the Minister of State has just said is quite plain. How then will religious belief be ascertained? How will discrimination on grounds of religious belief be proved? If there is no compulsion on any person to disclose his religion, how will religious balance be established? Will it simply be based on what everyone knows to be the religion of certain people? Will it just be based on "guesstimates"? It is not very clear.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) is right, and the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) has raised an important point. If the employer, for instance, has the information, the agency can require its disclosure, but it cannot require the employer either to provide information which it has not got, or to compile a register. Nor is there any compulsion on the agency itself to keep a register. It may wish to do so in specific cases, but it may not wish to, so there is no automatic demand for a register to be kept. In fact, the agency may try to assess religious discrimination or individual religious beliefs by taking a sample of a particular firm. The agency itself will have to operate as it sees fit and, as I keep repeating, it will operate in an open manner but in a manner which is in line with the Bill and the democratic procedures which we are used to.<br><br>
I do not see any danger in this situation but, of course, it is no use avoiding the issue, as paragraph 126 of the report states, states,
<br><blockquote><p>"We regard it as essential for the Agency, if it is to do its job effectively, to obtain information".</p></blockquote>
It cannot operate in a vacuum and, in consequence, we believe that that information will be readily accessible. We must leave it to the intelligence of the agency if it requires that information, but there is no compulsion to provide it where it does not exist, nor is there any compulsion on any person to provide information if he or she declines to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These debates this morning are proving very valuable because they are showing a closer degree of agreement between the intentions and expectations of the Minister and those which we entertain than the reading of the face of the Bill had hitherto led us to suppose. But I think—and this is an important matter—that there are still worries about this, to which he may wish to address his mind.<br><br>
I quite understand that to confer, as Schedule 5 read in conjunction with the clause does confer, a right to obtain specific information from specific people is not the same as giving the right to require persons to maintain a register. In practice, we all know that they tend to coalesce. To take an example from another field, many of the comprehensive returns of assets held by taxpayers are not strictly statutory, but the fact that they are asked for and tendered
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0152">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
arises from the right of the Inland Revenue to require specific information. The Inland Revenue can require specific items 1 to 100, and, in fact, what happens is that the taxpayer draws up a complete schedule, although there is nothing in the Act itself which authorises the Inland Revenue to demand the schedule. The schedule is a convenient way of complying with the individual requests for information which the Inland Revenue is empowered to make.<br><br>
What we fear, as the Bill stands, is that that is what will happen in this case. Under paragraphs 7 to 9, an agency can come to an employer and say "We want information about the religious beliefs, and so on, of your employees", but that will not result simply in the employer passing it off with a bland "I am awfully sorry, I do not have that information". That will not happen in practice. In practice, methods will be found by the agency—indeed, it has to find methods if it is to put the enforcement parts of the Bill into practice—of getting the information. In practice, therefore, employers will say to themselves, "For the sake of a quiet life, the simplest thing will be if we can always say to the agency 'Well, we can give you the information. As a matter of fact, we have not got it all. We are getting only 98 per cent of it, but here it is. You do not want us to show you the list, do you?'", to which the agency will reply "No, we do not want you to show us the list. You have got the full figures. All right, we will take it at that."</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is creating something here that does not really exist. If an employer does not keep a list which the agency can ask for, that employer is under no obligation to provide any other information if he does not desire to do so. The agency could, perhaps, ask for other information, but if, for instance, an employer who employs 100 people does not have a register of his employees' religious beliefs, and does not know or has never ascertained what those beliefs are, the agency cannot say "Have you got facts and figures about this?" The employer can say, "No." He cannot be compelled to provide such facts because there is nothing in the Bill that will make that possible. The agency will then need to find other means of obtaining that information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We certainly get this clearer as we go on, but we are still up against the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
difficulty. It may have been created for us, and I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has departed mute. He is running mute today, as they say in fox hunting. Perhaps we have been misdirected by the connection with the Report of the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee). One cannot read paragraph 126, to which the hon. Member referred, and the following paragraphs without drawing the conclusion that the practical consequence of the Bill is not merely going to be but is intended to be the widespread keeping of these records.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman quoted the words,
<br><blockquote><p>"We regard it as essential for the Agency, if it is to do its job effectively, to obtain information regarding religious affiliation."</p></blockquote>
Now he has assured us that it can be frustrated in its attempt to obtain information from the employer if the employer simply says, "Sorry. I know nothing of such matters at all." But then our anxieties are maintained when we read the following paragraphs which describe how this agency was expected, by those who recommended its existence, to operate—that it would actually go round to employers and make records.<br><br>
I draw the attention of the right hon. Gentleman to paragraph 131. This is not the Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And it is not the Bill either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not the Bill, but it is natural, when the Bill is so closely moulded upon the recommendations of this Report, that we should have regard to what the expectations—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. Gentleman reads that part—and, again, I am trying to help the Committee in this regard—may I point out that the Bill does not follow the Working Party Report fully in detail. This is one part where, if he dealt with the Bill rather than with the Working Party Report, his point would be met.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful, too, because paragraph 131 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Employers would have no obligation whatsoever to record religious affiliation unless specifically called upon by the Agency to do so in the exercise of its functions…."</p></blockquote>
What is valuable about this debate? It is valuable that we now have it on record that that was a recommendation—indeed, a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0153">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 271</span>
concept of the manner of procedure which the Government have actually rejected. Until this morning, I do not think that that was clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me put it firmly on the record for the right hon. Gentleman. The Bill does not take up the Working Party's proposals fully. The key point that he is dealing with here is that it leaves the employer free to decide whether or not to compile or keep a register.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That statement which has been elicited from the Minister is most valuable. Certainly, it fully takes into account—and I pay tribute to him—the state of opinion in Northern Ireland amongst employers and, with one exception, unions, as ascertained by the survey of my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker). Incidentally, that is another warning against supposing that because bodies put their names, without dissent, to a record, the views expressed in that report—even without dissent—reflect the opinion and experience of the members of those organisations. It is nice to have arrived at an actual demonstration that there can be, as I referred to it earlier, this gap or gulf between affirmation by organisations at the top of the pyramid and what actually happens on the ground.<br><br>
There are two further comments I would like to make before other members catch your eye, Mrs. Jeger, or before my hon. Friend who moved the amendment addresses the Committee again.<br><br>
One comment is, perhaps, a mere <i>obiter dictum.</i> It was thrown out by the right hon. Gentleman, when he referred to the agency taking a sample. It may be that this was incautious, but it is a horrifying notion that the agency moves into a factory—no, I have put that too strongly—secures the identification of the balance of religious beliefs in a work force by sampling techniques. I think it is inconsistent with a provision, of which we greatly approve, in Schedule 5.<br><br>
Schedule 5(8)(<i>b</i>) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"A person shall not be compelled … to give any information … from which there can be deduced, his religious belief, if he informs the Agency that he objects to doing so;"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to make progress on the Bill, and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is not having a debate for debate's sake, but may I again emphasise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
this to him. I used the word "sampling", for instance, and in a large concern that might, at times, appear to apply. I do not know. The agency must decide for itself. It may sample. But if it samples, or attempts to sample and finds its work is frustrated because people, rightly if they feel so inclined, decide not to give their religious affiliation, then other forms of identification, if the agency requires it, will need to be found. No pressure will be put on people on that basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, as the right hon. Gentleman envisages, sampling may often prove to be impracticable because it only requires individuals to have the right to opt out of the sample and that sample is vitiated.<br><br>
I conclude on this point. We have got great clarification, which is valuable clarification not only to members of this Committee but to people outside—and I hope note has been taken of it by those who, we know, have hitherto been anxious on this score. This debate has linked with the debate that we previously had on Clause 11. The misunderstandings and ungrounded fears, which the right hon. Gentleman has been able to dispel by what he said, relate very much to the notion of general surveys of religion in employment in Northern Ireland which was implanted in the minds of those who studied the Bill by the present form and wording of Clause 11.<br><br>
What I am saying to the right hon. Gentleman is that what he said on Clause 12 has added weight to the plea which I made to him that he should, in the light of his own words and interpretation, take another look at what he himself described as the "trigger clause", Clause 11.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the clarification which the right hon. Gentleman has given that it will not be a matter of compulsion that this should occur. I am sure the Minister will bear in mind that there will be employers who will feel concern to do things the "right" way—"right" being in inverted commas—and who may feel it incumbent upon themselves to keep registers so that they can show the "before" and "after" situation. We still find it objectionable that there should be pressure on people to do that.<br><br>
The Minister has conceded that difficulty will be encountered in obtaining the information. On the one hand, we are told that it is essential that the agency has it, but we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0154">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
now concede the difficulty of obtaining it. It may be that if sampling will not work and people will not disclose, we may resort to the method for which I was so viciously criticised, namely, that we may have to look at surnames and Christian names.<br><br>
I am conscious of this matter, Mrs. Jeger, because shortly after I arrived at this House, an hon. Gentleman from the Government benches came up to me and said, "How could anyone with a name like McCusker ever be a Unionist?" It is therefore not something necessarily confined to Northern Ireland. I have a surname which would present difficulty to the agency in trying to determine my religion.<br><br>
We welcome the assurances that have been given and we hope they will go a long way towards allaying fears in Northern Ireland. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

Personally, I regard some of the amendments which were tabled by the Conservative element in the Committee as raising questions to which one would have been glad to have had an answer. Perhaps we must wait a little longer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the points we wish to make would be better made on "Clause stand part".</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case it is only a pleasure deferred. We shall hear the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) at that stage.<br><br>
We are here in the midst of the enforcement procedure, and we are dealing with the case where a person has an employer, for instance, who has given an undertaking, in view of the opinion formed by the agency, that he was not providing equality of opportunity. That is the point in the game we have reached with this amendment.<br><br>
Subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) says that where a person declines to give an undertaking, or where, in the view of the agency, he does not comply with it—subsection (2)(<i>b</i>)—the agency can do one of two things. It can either proceed to serve a notice with directions, and that triggers the compulsory mechanism set out in subsequent provisions of the Bill, or it can serve on him a notice of which the directions supersede the undertaking.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
What puzzles my hon. Friend and me is why, because an undertaking is not given or not complied with, the agency should change its mind in mid-stream. Instead of saying "If you will not give the undertaking, we will serve a notice on you in the same terms", or alternatively, instead of saying "As you have not carried out the undertaking which you gave we will serve a notice on you", it is able to change its mind and say "We are going to serve a notice on you but the notice will not be in the terms of the undertaking". That is how we envisage the effect of the words
<br><blockquote><p>"whose directions shall supersede the undertaking".</p></blockquote>
It may be that that is a misapprehension, but in the context of the clause it would seem an inequity between the two cases set out in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) of subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) and we should be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman could clarify the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a technical but important point. The effect of the amendment would be to remove the words that make it clear that where an undertaking that has been given by a person that he will take action to ensure equality of opportunity is not complied with, and the agency decides to serve on him notice containing directions for promoting equality of opportunity, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0155">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
directions supersede the undertaking. The omission of these words would, therefore, cause confusion because there would be a doubt, where the directions differ from the undertaking, whether both still apply. It is necessary therefore to remove any room for doubt that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"whose directions shall supersede the undertaking"</p></blockquote>
should remain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That has made the position very clear. That confirms that it is as I understood it. What I still do not understand is why there should be a difference between the contents of the notice and the contents of the undertaking.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman, in giving his explanation to the Committee, said that this was necessary to avoid conflict between the content of the undertaking and the content of the notice, and therefore one had to say that the notice supersedes the undertaking. Will the Minister explain why one should give a notice which anyhow is different in its purport from the undertaking which it is the purpose of the notice to enforce?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that this is to prevent recourse to the courts and to give the direction to the employer so that he has an opportunity to resolve the matter without the agency necessarily having to go to the courts to have a decision on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case I apologise for conducting a kind of cross-examination in the Committee, but I am sure you will appreciate, Mrs. Jeger, that in matters of drafting of this sort, it is very difficult otherwise to have clarifications.<br><br>
May we take it that the intention is that the directions in the notice may be less onerous—to use a popular term—than the directions in the undertaking? It would clearly be unreasonable that the directions in the notice were more onerous than what at a previous stage had been thought reasonable by the agency. As the Bill stands, the agency could use this power as a means of enforcement. It could say to the employer, "Look here, this is the undertaking for which we are asking, but if you do not give that undertaking we will serve a notice on you asking you to do twice as much." That is clearly not the intention, as it would be unreasonable.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that the right hon. Gentleman will be advised, either at this or a later stage in the proceedings, that we could
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
include in the Bill—again, I am not presuming to draft it in Committee—some proviso to show that the directions shall not be more onerous than the requirements of the undertaking. From that it will follow that they could be less onerous, and I accept that that could enable the matter to be amicably disposed of between the agency and the employer. It seems that there is a loophole—if only theoretically—for unreasonable behaviour. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will indicate that he can find a wording which will stop that hole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: think I can say to the right hon. Gentleman that yes, the directions might be less onerous than hitherto, as opposed to going to the court. The Bill is clear on this point but I will have a look at it with my advisers and see if the drafting needs tightening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the understanding that the object is to ensure that we do not have a notice more onerous than an undertaking which, nevertheless, supersedes that undertaking, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 39, in page <b>10,</b> line <b>8,</b> leave out 'or may result'.<br><br>
I wish to suggest to the Committee that if in Clause 13, (3)(<i>a</i>) the words "or may result" are included it will make the drafting loose, even dangerously loose, and may cause apprehension among employers who may be willing to co-operate with the agency and to carry out the provisions of the Bill. We need to be careful not to give <i>carte blanche</i> to this agency. The directions which the agency can enforce will be less speculative, and I think we should like to hear from the Minister about the kind of practices which are envisaged.<br><br>
Supposing one has a work force which is unbalanced in terms of religious belief, or political opinion, perhaps for historical or topographical reasons—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must mention the difficulty in hearing, because too much conversation is taking place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shall I raise my voice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Please.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0156">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to hear from the Minister as to what practices, in fact, would be adopted to deal with such situations so as to make a work force more representative of the local population—not as it was when the practices came into vogue, but as it is now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) has asked for an example. For instance, if the agency found that a particular employer recruited employees from any area whose population was predominantly one of religious denomination, without necessarily committing any act of unlawful discrimination, a direction might require him to extend his catchment area. Similarly, if he advertises employment vacancies in publications of a certain religious slant—as we know, there are papers that are read by one section or another of the community—he could be directed to advertise more widely, or, if some element of an employer's selection procedure favoured persons of one religious denomination, he could be required to alter those procedures.<br><br>
Those are clear examples of what could happen. I think that the catchment areas would be an important example, because often they fall into the pattern of employment argument that we had earlier, and possibly the widening of the catchment area could alter the balance of people available.<br><br>
The Government feel it essential that once the agency has found that a person has failed to provide equality of opportunity, it should be able to deal with the practice of that person which contributes to the situation. If it is clear that a particular practice which that person has been applying may result in inequality of opportunity in the future, it should be possible for the agency to be able to secure that that practice is discontinued or modified straight away, and not left operative until it has had the effect of causing inequality of opportunity in the future. The effect of the amendment would damage that purpose within the Bill and, therefore, I would ask the Committee not to accept it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negative.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 13 is the natural sequence moving on from Clause 12. Clause 12 deals with an investigation into
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
the possibility of lack of equality of opportunity, and Clause 13 seeks to deal with that inequality.<br><br>
If it was as simple as that, I would take no exception to either of the clauses, particularly Clause 13, and, I think that we would all agree, with the case in the example the Minister has just given.<br><br>
I want to put myself into the position of an employer who has gone through the procedure. I have had a man from the agency call on me, and he decides to investigate my various recruitment and selection procedures and practices to see if there is any evidence of lack of equality of opportunity. He asks me what schools I visit during the year to make contacts in order to get applicants. I tell him and he then says, "You must widen your scope. I would like you, as well as going to Lurgan Model School and Kings Park School and Carrick School, to go to St. Malachy's School and St. Peters School." I say, "Right, from now on in my tour of Lurgan, if that is the town I am recruiting in, I will go to those."<br><br>
The agency man says "Where do you advertise when you have vacancies?" and I tell him that I advertise in the <i>Lurgan Mail.</i> He asks me if that is all and I say, "Occasionally I advertise in the <i>Lurgan and Portadown Examiner.</i> He tells me that that is not good enough and that I must advertise always in those two newspapers.<br><br>
He asks me if there are any other trends in recruitment, and if I rely on a father bringing a son in or on a man bringing in a brother. We go through all those various matters which the Minister rightly says could throw a bias into a certain section of the community so that one is always drawing from the one catchment area.<br><br>
The agency man says, "Good, you now agree to do all these things; by discussion and conciliation we agree on that action." So he goes off, apparently quite happy. But does he go off quite happily? He does not, because he might well know that I am, in the terms of the Model Manpower Policy guide, meeting precisely the various practices which have always been accused of providing unequal opportunity. He feels that he has to go much further because the bulk of the objections that he has, show that there is something sinister happening in this place of employment. So he compiles a register of religious affiliations, as he is authorised to do in Clause 12. He is empowered to look into the composition of my work force and he comes to the conclusion that it is grossly imbalanced, only one

religious denomination being employed in my factory.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
He is now confronted with the situation that here is an employer who is employing only one religious grouping but who is, nevertheless, agreeing that the various practices which might have resulted from that have to change and he is going to do something different. Is it enough that, because I have now agreed to widen all the various practices, the agency can be satisfied? I contend that it would not be satisfied. By the report upon which the Bill is based, it could not be satisfied either.<br><br>
Obviously, in 12 months' time, if we are working on the basis of unintentional discrimination the agency should come back and say "Have you been doing all of these things?" I would say "Yes. I have religiously followed them. I have given you the dates. I have visited the schools. I will give you the editions and the copies of the advertisements that I have placed in all the local newspapers. I have done everything that you have told me." The agency will then say "Let us take a look at the religious composition of your work force."<br><br>
The report and the Bill would mean that after 12 months or 18 months—whatever period one wants to allow—there should be an indicatin that the religious composition of my work force was changing. If it was not changing, the agency could then come to the conclusion that there was something more to it, the nitty-gritty problem of the X-factor—namely, that for all the good practices, and the professional and selection techniques available, there was a person in the factory who was deliberately and malevolently discriminating against a person on the basis of religious belief. That might not be the right conclusion, but it is one to which the agency could come.<br><br>
The employer is then faced with the predicament, during the period from the first visit to the second visit, of taking action to change the religious composition of his work force other than simply straightening out his various recruitment and selection procedures. He will have all the encouragement he needs from the working party report, which on pages 14 and 15 deals in detail with affirmative action. I am sure that the Minister will not say that this does not have any relevance to Clause 13.<br><br>
The employer will, apart from remedying the various practices that may have been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
wrong, embark upon a course of affirmative action which will change the religious composition of his work force. It is not necessarily getting down to as fine a detail as a two-thirds/one-third ratio, but the report says that affirmative action can be more clearly understood where the employer translates the corrective action required into specific goals, which may include numerical goals. That might not mean quotas in the sense of specified distinct quotas. There is a pressure put upon the employer to start to consider, when he is recruiting, precisely what is the religious affiliation of the applicant.<br><br>
This is where, perhaps, we can link back to the comment about a management tool. A management tool that is to be provided by the agency will provide the employer with information which will enable him to avoid getting into conflict with the agency so that he now starts to take account of the religious affiliation of applicants. I should like to know from the Minister whether in Clause 13 he envisages a situation where the agency, apart from agreeing by conciliation to remedy practices, may ultimately say to an employer "Let us consider your work force. Let us consider what is right for all concerned. Can we agree that this time next year there will be a ten per cent. or fifteen per cent. swing from this religious grouping to the other religious grouping?"<br><br>
If that is occurring, does not it mean that that employer will now be guilty of benign discrimination, inasmuch that when he is confronted with a Protestant applicant and a Catholic applicant, he will have to look at the religious composition of his work force and perhaps decide that it would be in his best interests if on that occasion he employed the Catholic, or the Protestant as the case might be, because if an agency man called again, it would be essential for him to show that the balance had changed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The success or otherwise of the clause, and indeed other clauses, will be determined, as has so rightly been said, by the personnel who man the Fair Employment Agency. They will be the people to have discussions with the employers to see whether there has been a pattern and if that pattern can be changed. A great deal will depend on the personnel employed by the agency, and those under their instructions who carry out interviews with employers.<br><br>
Although I am fully in support of it, I am the first to recognise that, in the atmosphere now existing in Northern Ireland, all this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0158">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
legislation could prove to be of no avail while a campaign of violence is in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Counter-productive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But this legislation is designed to create the atmosphere in which we all hope that violence will be taken off the streets of Northern Ireland, so that in some way we may again begin to lead a civilised life. Strangely, I agree with the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) that there are cases, particularly in Belfast, where there would appear to be a gross imbalance in workers on the grounds of religion.<br><br>
I turn my remarks specifically to the shipyards. I know that in my own constituency, for example—this will probably please the hon. Member for Armagh—there are firms whose work force is, I believe, 100 per cent. Catholic. There are many reasons for that. It is possible that a fear would be engendered among Protestants to traverse the area of the Falls Road, the Donegal Road or other streets, at present. There is another problem of which I am sure that the Minister has been made aware. We all know the disaster brought about by the introduction of internment. Happily for us, internment is finished. I am sure that I shall be in order, Mrs. Jeger, in saying that many people were interned unjustifiably. There was no evidence against them. Since then they have been released, but in the eyes of many people, particularly in the opposing community, they were guilty of something otherwise they would not have been interned. So anyone who had been interned from the Catholic community is highly unlikely to be able to find a job outside the ghetto, outside the area in which he lives. The only place where he can get a job is in that part of West Belfast where he has been born and reared.<br><br>
That could be to the disadvantage of the employer. It might be that the employer would not want particularly to employ an ex-internee and would rather have a Protestant working for him. But conditions being what they are, nothing much can be done about the situation at present. The same could apply to a lesser extent to a Protestant firm which would rather employ skilled persons more suitable for the job who happened to be Catholics, but could not do so because of the location of the firm.<br><br>
There are these technical difficulties. If anyone expects this Bill when enacted to erase all the discrimination and the differences that have existed in Northern Ireland
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
for so long, he is being unduly optimistic.<br><br>
I conclude by again referring to what I see as the intention of the Bill—to create the atmosphere for the eradication of discrimination, not to force employers into an impossible position but to try to explain that it would be in the interests of the firm commercially, of its employees and industrial relations to be seen to be employing people to do the job, and not on the basis of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman concede that it would be grossly unfair for the agency to go to an employer in a part of Northern Ireland with an imbalance in the labour force and insist that he should take certain action while, at the same time, for all the reasons just described—in fact, it may prove dangerous for the agency representative to go in to investigate—ignoring certain locations, say, in West or East Belfast?<br><br>
We are in this conundrum of making it a duty for the agency to take such action; yet is the agency going to carry out this duty partially or not at all?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have already been told repeatedly by the Minister that all the circumstances relating to any particular employer or industry will be taken into consideration. I certainly would not support this legislation if I thought that the agency was going to act in a purely destructive way and try to intimidate or coerce employers into taking an unpopular line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to clarify this point? We have done a lot of clarifying this morning—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I be clear? Has the hon. Gentleman finished his speech?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. Mrs. Jeger.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I just want to say that all directions of the agency are subject to appeal. Therefore, the agency will not be able to act irresponsibly or impose irresponsible directions—nor do I think that it will—but there are safeguards should it do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman again confirms what might happen later in relation to the Bill and this clause. I believe that the members of the agency will act in a responsible way. There will be no coercion
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0159">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
or intimidation, but it may be weeks, months or even years before we see the full effects of the Bill, so who can oppose this measure on the grounds that it will be a long time before we see the results?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making important points from his knowledge of his own constituency in the city of Belfast. Is not one consideration, which has not so far been mentioned, the attitude of the work force? Is it not the addiction to the practices with which the Bill is intended to grapple? Is it not very often the work force that is much keener on these practices than the employer, who might even not care less about them? Does not the heavy burden then rest on the people on the shop floor and the trade unions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very important point. Certainly there are employers in Northern Ireland who would want to enlarge the catchment areas of their work force and would want to try to get away from what would appear to be discriminatory practices. But there is this very real problem, in that the work force may want to keep the discrimination going and acting against the employer's interests.<br><br>
But this is two-way legislation. Indeed, support has already been given for this legislation by employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. It is up to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions now to accept its responsibility and to say the work force "We do not want you to engage in any discrimination against a fellow worker, and we want you to act in this firm not as a Protestant or a Catholic". Unfortunately, in the past, the reality and the tragedy of what has been said by the hon. Gentleman is all too true.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
Again, in the early stages of this debate, I brought to the Committee's attention what had happened in Rolls-Royce, Dundonald, and how that work force was originally recruited. A vast majority of those employed there were Protestants, and a small minority were Catholics. One morning a number of Catholics were getting out of a small car in which they were being driven to work, when they were met by machine-gun fire which killed some of them and seriously wounded the others, which led to the rest of the Catholics leaving that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 284</span>
particular firm.<br><br>
I have no doubt that Rolls-Royce were in no way involved in that murderous assassination of their workers, but I am also convinced that there were some other employees of the firm who knew the religious identification of those persons who were killed. Perhaps they were set up for assassination. I have no doubt that did happen. There is no question of that. As I said, the result was that all the Catholics employed by the firm then left. Rolls-Royce was left with an almost total Protestant work force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope we can keep more closely to Clause 13.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to sit down much earlier, but the question was brought to the attention of the Committee.<br><br>
There is an enormous responsibility now being given to the trade union movement in Northern Ireland—I think that will be readily accepted—to talk to the workers on the shop floor throughout industry. The onus is then on the agency to talk to the employers. There is a two-way traffic and I can only express my sincere hope that it will be successful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman sits down, may I ask him whether he will turn his attention to new Clause 1, because from what he has said, I hope that we should have his support for it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Farr</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) said, new Clause 1 is important, although it has not been considered by you, Mrs. Jeger, for selection. The intervention by my hon. Friend was not without reference to Clause 13 which is under consideration.<br><br>
Throughout the Bill so far, so much emphasis has been placed upon the role of the employer and so little importance has been attached to a situation which all too often arises when groups of employees, for one reason or another, wish to adopt a certain course or a certain attitude.<br><br>
I support Clause 13 because I think it would do a lot to improve the Bill. We have to recognise that the agency will have a task to attack discrimination where it occurs and where, after investigation, it has found that unfair discrimination of one sort or another has taken place in the provision of jobs.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0160">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
It is no use hon. Members on either side saying that discrimination has not occurred, and despite the good intentions of Clause 13—and indeed the whole Bill when enacted—may still not occur in the future, although we all hope that it will occur to a lesser extent in the future.<br><br>
At the present time in a company like Harland and Wolff with 9,000 workers, it is estimated that only 300 are Catholics. Mackies have 8,500 workers and 120 are Catholics. Sirocco Works have 400 workers and no Catholics, and Ormeau Bakery have 300 workers and until recently had no Catholics.<br><br>
These are fairly big companies and it is obvious that there is a job for the agency to do in investigating the manner in which employees are engaged in such companies in Northern Ireland, and to put into effect the machinery which is laid down in this Bill.<br><br>
It appears to me that it will be a little difficult for the agency to conduct its proper investigation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before he leaves this point, I am sure the hon. Gentleman will remember that I was asked how I got my information regarding the figures I quoted last week. Will the hon. Gentleman tell us how he got his information and how he authenticated it?<br><br>
Could he also, in the interests of providing a proper balance, name a number of companies where the reverse would apply?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Farr</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately I was abroad last week on Government business at the time of this meeting, to which the hon. Member refers Therefore, I cannot recall the exchange and I confess that I have not actually, as yet, completed my study of the HANSARD transcripts of what took place at those two meetings. But I will study them and see whether I can help the hon. Member on these points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I help my hon. Friend by asking him if he will study the record? He will find that I asked the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) whether the results of his questionnaire could be placed before this Committee. It may be of advantage to the Committee if the hon. Gentleman could do that, and it would also be helpful if my hon. Friend could lay his information before the Committee.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Farr</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do all that my hon. Friend suggests. I genuinely try to please him in every way that I can, but I have been struck, so far, from my close study of the transcript of the last two proceedings, by the significant way in which an overwhelming amount of time has been taken up by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell)—despite his protestations that he wishes to make progress and wishes to hear points which my hon. Friend might or might not put forward.<br><br>
Coming back to this clause, I wish to see it included in the Bill. I think that it is odd that it will be difficult, as the Minister said, for an agency representative to require an employer to provide a list of the religions of his employees. Surely if that information is not to be made available on request, it is difficult to see how much, of what might be considered discrimination, can be proved or established without some power of demanding employers to provide such a list for the agency's inspectors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with great care, but it appears, not only from the facts that he has just given to the Committee, but from those which the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) gave last week, that these figures appear readily to be available to people in Northern Ireland. I do not think, therefore, that the difficulty will be as great as the hon. Gentleman fears.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Farr</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for what he has said. That is the case, of course, with the big public companies. But this Bill not only hits the Harland and Wolffs, the Rolls-Royces and the Courtaulds of Northern Ireland. It affects, and will affect, the way of life of many small employers who are not so much in the public eye. The agency's inspectors will not have the same ability because there will not be the same universal knowledge that applies to the bigger employer. Therefore, I feel that that aspect of the Bill is not altogether satisfactory. Other than that, I hope that this clause is accepted by the Committee and is put into the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will have the opportunity to reply briefly on this clause before we rise at One o'clock, but there are two matters that I should like to raise. The first is verbal, but not, on that account, unimportant. It is, in general, I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0161">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
believe, a principle of making statutes that where the meaning is the same the words should be the same. This is especially important when we are entering into a largely unexplored area of legislation that concerns equality of opportunity in employment.<br><br>
In this clause, and also in adjacent clauses, there appear to be no fewer than four different terms used for the same thing and for the same obligation of an employer. This must be undesirable as tending to introduce doubt. If the right hon. Gentleman looks at subsection (1) he will find that where,
<br><blockquote><p>"… the Agency is of the opinion that the person … has failed to provide equality of opportunity …"</p></blockquote>
then it can set about
<br><blockquote><p>"… to secure that he takes such action to ensure equality of opportunity …"</p></blockquote>
Is there any difference between "providing" equality of opportunity and "ensuring" equality of opportunity, because they are both predicated of an employer? If the right hon. Gentleman will turn forward, which I hope you will permit him for this purpose to do, Mrs. Jeger, to Clause 14, he will find, in line 15, page 11, that the employer must "afford" equality of opportunity.<br><br>
Finally, "secure" also makes its appearance in connection with equality of opportunity, and in Schedule 3 with the subject, not the agency, but the employer as well. So there are no fewer than four different attitudes of the employer towards equality of opportunity—providing, ensuring, affording and securing.<br><br>
I think that it is important—and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will take me seriously—that in exploring new legislation on this topic, we use precise formulae and use the same formula again when the same matter is at stake and—this is particularly important—where we are moving on to clauses where compulsion is involved. Clearly it would lead to unnecessary litigation if the employer or anyone else involved were able to draw attention to a different wording in the statute and say that he was affording employment of opportunity, but that this particular reference required him to secure it. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will look very carefully before the next stage at this matter which I conceive is of real importance.<br><br>
My other observation is on the lines of what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker). One of the values of this morning's debate has been the strength with which the Minister of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
State has shown his opposition to a numerical approach to this question—not just a quota approach, but the crude numerical approach. Certainly, that approach was implicit in some of the passages of the working party report which have been quoted.<br><br>
In a previous debate the right hon. Gentleman relieved the anxieties of some of us by showing that the Government and, therefore—I hope—the agency, were going to take their own line on these matters. There is a real danger of reverse discrimination if employers are going to be presented with a numerical picture and then asked to correct it. They can only correct it if they exercise a kind of discrimination which may be very unfair in the new context.<br><br>
I trust that our proceedings, or at any rate the Minister's part, are going to be studied by the agency and that, therefore, what we say here will influence the manner in which the agency interprets and applies itself to its duties. I hope that it will take from this debate, and the debate on this enforcement clause, the indication that we would regard enforcement in terms of numerical balance, enforcement in terms of anything which could be even misunderstood as a quota, as counter-productive for the success of this Bill. I think that point is worth emphasising once again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the two minutes left to me I should like to reply to the right hon. Gentleman's points, but I will not, unfortunately, be able to do so. On his last point, that I try to get away from numerical balance as well as quotas and rigidity in this situation. I hope that I have gone some way towards doing that. We are dealing with a human problem and we shall not resolve it by laws, however stringent, though the law can assist in resolving the matter.<br><br>
On that basis, I hope that I shall be able to deal with some of the textual matters. I take note of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks, and on Clause 14 we shall be able to meet his point on one particular word.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say to the Minister that it is because of what he has said so clearly about quotas that I did not think it necessary to move the amendment in the names of my hon. Friend and myself, to the disappointment of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell).</span></p>
