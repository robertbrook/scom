	<time>Thursday 8th April 1976</time>
	<p>[MRS. LENA JEGER 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>

	<div class='page-header'><h1>FAIR EMPLOYMENT (NORTHERN IRELAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to inform the Committee that to the provisional selection of amendments I have added Amendment No. 52 which we shall take with Amendment No. 51 when we reach that point in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 57</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>GENERAL INTERPRETATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed—(6th April)</i>—That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we suspended our proceedings on Tuesday I was saying that I thought Clause 57, which is a long and detailed clause relating to certain interpretations of critical importance to the Bill, was defective in certain respects. In addition, I think that certain interpretations contained in the clause call for an explanation from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we suspended I was about to refer to the interpretation of "unlawful discrimination" on page 41 of the Bill. In view of the fact that these two words taken together have such significance, I ask the Minister to say whether the interpretation is to be construed only in accordance with Clause 16(5) as indicated in the interpretation clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One might make a case for a wider interpretation of the words "unlawful discrimination" if one were so minded. I am particularly anxious to have the Minister's view on whether the interpretation of "unlawful discrimination" as contained in the Bill means that and nothing else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally. I raised with the Minister on Tuesday a query about the financial year meaning a year ending on 31st March, and I asked why it was 31st March and not 5th April as I understand it is in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>530</span>
The Minister may care to know that there is quite a history about the ending of the financial year. Apparently, originally, the financial year used to end on 31st March and the change to 6th April for the commencement of the new financial year dates back to 1753 when Britain adopted the Gregorian Calendar, named after Pope Gregory XIII, in which there was an 11-day difference. I do not suppose that any of those considerations have influenced the Minister in selecting 31st March as the specific date given in the third line on page 40 of the Bill, but I should be grateful if he would comment on it when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long speech from the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) and I shall certainly reply to the salient points he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Committee stage has been very thorough and there has been no attempt by any Member to delay the Committee or to engage in filibustering. I hope that the rumour that it is the intention of some hon. Gentlemen opposite to keep the Committee going until Tuesday is not true, because I think our work is far too important for that and everybody in the Committee has played an important part in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about the farming industry and whether or not it was covered by the Bill. The answer is "Yes."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also asked a question about Clause 16 and unlawful discrimination. Clause 16 says what it means. The answer, therefore, is that it does not go outside the terms of the Bill as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the previous sitting the hon. Member for Harborough objected to the word "definition" of contract. However, I am informed that "definition" only states the ordinary rules of law and its general application. In regard to the intriguing point which he has raised about the financial year, 31st March is the normal accounting date for Government Departments as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 58</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>AMENDMENTS AND EXTENSION OF ENACTMENTS, AND REPEAL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 170, in page 43, line 24, leave out "(	<i>b</i>)".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Small though it is, this amendment raises a very important point of administration and legislation. If we refer to the 1973 Act we find that section 20(1) defines the duties of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Paragraph (	<i>b</i>), which is to be repealed by subsection (3) of this clause, relates to the duty of that Commission to keep the Secretary of State informed as to the extent to which persons or bodies have prevented discrimination by persons or bodies not prohibited from discriminating by that law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand why the enactment of the Bill renders that duty of the Commission superfluous. But my hon. Friends and I do not, as at present advised, understand why the other part of the function of the Advisory Commission as set out in Section 20(1)(	<i>a</i>) of the 1973 Act is not also, in effect, rendered superfluous by the machinery which we are setting up by means of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The function set out in subsection (	<i>a</i>) is to advise the Secretary of State on the adequacy and effectiveness of the law for the time being in force in preventing discrimination on the ground of religious belief or political opinion, and it provides redress for persons who are aggrieved by discrimination on either ground. I cannot imagine anybody more suitable for doing that task than the agency created by the Bill for the purpose of preventing discrimination on those grounds, and helping to obtain redress for persons who are aggrieved. Surely, the agency in its formal reports, and those tendered by other bodies under the Bill, both to the Secretary of State and to Parliament, and in its informal activity will be in the best possible position for carrying out the function in paragraph (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would hardly expect, minuscule though the amendment is, that it could be accepted in its present form. As I read the 1973 Act we should by making this amendment deprive the Human Rights Commission of any function whatsoever. That is something which could be argued in another context. But it is certainly not the intention
	<span class='label label-info column'>532</span>
of my hon. Friends and myself. Our intention is to draw the attention of the Minister and the Committee to what appears to be a very serious overlap in the functions of the two bodies. We all know that the Human Rights Commission is going about its work on a different plane and in a different setting from that in which the agency will operate. Whether the ultimate result of its deliberations and activities will be useful or not, it is premature to attempt to predict.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are still worried by the fact that there is a complete overlap, as I see it, between the duty of the Commission under Section 20(1)(	<i>a</i>) and the duty of the agency under this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Under-Secretary will be able to show how it is intended that, in future, the functions of these two bodies shall be kept apart because, quite clearly, if the agency is set up it will have a wealth of information and experience in the working of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the law for the time being in force in preventing discrimination",</p></blockquote>
which no other body could possibly have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be stupid of the Commission to say to the agency, "Tell us how you are getting on. What are the weaknesses of the Act?", and for the agency simply to say "This is the report that we have sent to the Minister and here is a carbon copy of it". This clearly cannot be the intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, it is undesirable that we should part from the clause without a clear understanding of how the two bodies in future are intended respectively to function. The more distinct those functions can be in future, the more useful, as well as more economic, will the operations of each body turn out to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. J. D. Concannon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In moving his amendment, the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) gave the answer to it as well. As he said, the amendment has the effect of repealing the whole of Section 20(1) of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, the clause repeals only subsection 20(1)(	<i>b</i>) of the Act and is necessary since the functions given to the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights under that subsection are, effectively, transferred to the Fair Employment Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>533</span>
Subsection 20(1)(	<i>a</i>) of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act, which the amendment would also repeal, provides that the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights should advise the Secretary of State on the adequacy and effectiveness of the law in preventing discrimination no matter where it occurs, so paragraph (	<i>a</i>) confers general functions outside the scope of the Bill, outside the field of employment as well. So it is not only in employment, but on the grounds of religious belief or political opinion and in providing redress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would, therefore, remove the whole raison d'être behind the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights. Even if, as the right hon. Gentleman said, this were to be the right policy, it would be wholly wrong so to provide in a Bill dealing with Fair Employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that explanation satisfies the right hon. Gentleman, who said that his intention was not to do as the amendment provides but to probe around and see what could be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Under-Secretary for drawing attention to the important fact that Section 20(1)(	<i>a</i>) of the 1973 Act is comprehensive, whereas this Bill deals only with employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overlap, therefore, is limited to the field, important though it is, of employment. It would, perhaps, be right for me to give notice informally that I think that overlap deserves attention, and that that could conveniently be considered at a subsequent stage of the Bill, perhaps in terms of an amendment, to exclude employment, when referring to Northern Ireland, or whatever words might be appropriate, from the ambit of Section 20(1)(	<i>a</i>) in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that we shall have a further opportunity of considering the point, as narrowed quite rightly by the Under-Secretary. I only add that our brief debate is an illustration of the way in which the evolving constitutional situation influences our attitude towards Northern Ireland registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Probably, in practice, if this Bill had come first, then the feeling that one had to set up the Standing Advisory Commission might well have been postponed. We are in danger—this is a point worth briefly making—as a result of the successive bites that have been taken of the cherry—which is a very inadequate metaphor for
	<span class='label label-info column'>534</span>
that of which bites are taken—of getting rather a clutter of different points of view superimposed on one another in successive strata of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, leaving that general consideration on one side and giving notice that I think we ought to look at the next stage and at eliminating the actual admitted overlap between the two provisions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 58 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 59</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>SHORT TITLE, EXTENT AND COMMENCEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 160, in page 43, line 41, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) An order under subsection (5) shall be subject to annulment by a resolution of either House of Parliament in like manner as a Statutory Instrument and section 5 of the Statutory Instruments Act 1946 shall apply accordingly".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this amendment is not simply to indulge the joy of attaching the negative procedure to ministerial orders wherever they appear in a Bill. I admit right away that in much legislation there would be no justification for the commencement orders being subject to the special parliamentary procedure. But in this Bill the commencing date or dates is a matter of real substance, which is probably not the case with most legislation which, for convenience, comes into effect from a date or dates to be determined by order by the relevant Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of this Bill, as earlier debate and particularly the contributions of my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) made clear, the preparedness of the ground for the effective and tactful functioning of the agency is a matter of importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have referred to the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh, who has played a useful and substantial part in these proceedings, Mrs. Jeger, may I say that he is attending the funeral of one of his constituents who was recently murdered in the place where others have been murdered before?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>535</span>
I hope that the Government will look favourably upon the special treatment for commencement orders in the context of this Bill. After all, there was a time 20 years or more ago, when Governments looked very jealously upon negative procedures in Acts of Parliament. It was the age of "the midnight hags" and all those goings on, but since then we have gone to the opposite extreme. Since then, Mrs. Jeger, it is only by the treatest good fortune that we can ever move a Prayer within the 40 days, and it is additional or alternative good fortune if we get an Early Day Motion to discuss the matter at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Whips, through their distinguished representative on this Committee, need not, I submit, jog the elbow of the Minister of State and say that he would incur his right hon. Friend's displeasure if he were to make this amendment. It is simply the proposition that there ought to be the normal safeguard here, since the commencement date is a substantive and not merely a technical ministerial decision against the background of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long. The point raised by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) is reasonable. This is a very important measure. It will be far-reaching in its revolutionary effects in Northern Ireland, and I wonder whether the Under-Secretary, on behalf of the Minister of State on behalf of the Secretary of State, can tell us when it is proposed that the Bill when it is enacted should come into operation. Is it proposed to give considerable delay, so that those affected by this important measure will have a chance of adjusting themselves mentally and in other ways to its consequences? Will there be a reasonable time for thought? What is in the Government's mind about the operation of the measure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For my part I have sympathy with the amendment. I shall listen with considerable interest to what is said about any particular difficulties that might arise. Although I am not greatly concerned about the merits of the commencement dates of this legislation or the procedure for achieving that, as my hon. Friends will know, I have a long-standing concern about statutory instrument procedure and the diminishing opportunity that the House has to exercise control over delegated powers of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>536</span>
If the amendment were written into the Bill and the negative procedure applied, it would not present any practical difficulties concerning the commencement date. My hon. Friend will know from his existence in a previous incarnation, before holding his present office, how much difficulty there is for a Government of any persuasion in finding time on the floor of the House of Commons even to debate a Prayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whip hand, both in the literal and metaphorical sense of that expression, would remain with the Government as to whether any Prayer to annul the order had debating time in the Chamber, and therefore the acceptance of the amendment would represent a minimal concession. Unless my hon. Friend is able to persuade me otherwise, it appears to have no practical administrative effect, but it would at least give the House of Commons a technical and theoretical opportunity to have an expression of view about the date of commencement of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore if the Committee should divide on this matter, my inclination is to support the amendment—I emphasise, not in relation to the merits of this particular legislation and its commencement date, but because of the general principle of the House of Commons retaining powers rather than giving them away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order to which this amendment relates is that by which the Secretary of State appoints the commencement of the Bill or certain provisions of it. The amendment would make the order subject to the negative resolution procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, this would be contrary to usual practice to make the commencement order subject to negative resolution procedure. From what has been said this morning, it is advisable to state the Government's intentions in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intended to bring into effect those provisions establishing the agency as soon as the Bill becomes law. The remaining provisions relating to the agency's operational functions will be brought into effect as soon as the agency has had sufficient time to acquaint itself fully with its functions and recruit and train its staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment covers what is usual practice, but if the Committee wish us to look at the matter again, we will do so, though I cannot give any promises on behalf of my right hon. Friend. We shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>537</span>
reconsider the matter in the light of what has been said this morning. However, I thought it would be advisable if at this time we made a statement of our intentions in respect of the timetable for the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Airey Neave</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of Parliament, I think the Government should look at this amendment again. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has agreed to reconsider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we are all obliged to the hon. Gentleman for his indication of the intentions of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say, as I have said before, that my hon. Friends and I, though sceptical of the method adopted by the Bill in obtaining the general objects, have no intention of doing anything but assist in every way the functioning of the Bill if and when it reaches the Statute Book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in that interest that we believe that the House should have the means, if so desired, however unlikely, of discussing the point of preparedness which has been reached before that mechanism is put into effect. That is virtually all we ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess to some disappointment that the hon. Member could not advise the Committee to accept the amendment. It is not often that one has much chance of drafting an amendment which is likely to receive support in official quarters, but from time to time it looks to the layman as though he can pinch a subsection from elsewhere in the Bill and thus stop the parliamentary draftsmen from complaining that he has not got it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must admit that I have indulged this lighthearted fancy on this occasion. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will feel that he can allow this subsection to be added this morning. After all, if anything is wrong with it, it can easily be put right. It would be a sign of his benevolence if he were to do so. The request has been made to him from both sides of the Committee, and I shall, therefore, refrain from withdrawing the amendment in the hope that this little gesture might be forthcoming this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The absence of precedent is a compelling argument in Departments of State.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will take the Committee briefly back to our debates which took place in March, in particular to the debate on 30th March, on Clause 34. At that time, as will be seen in col. 423 	<i>of the Official Report,</i> when we were discussing Clause 34, on accessories and incitement, my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) gave an example which had come to his knowledge, of a situation where an employer had been subject to pressure by some of his employees in connection with the employment of other employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I were not completely satisfied with the answer which the Minister gave. We feel that it is a matter of such importance that it is wrong to rely upon the protection of the Person and Property Act (Northern Ireland) 1969. Indeed, without this clause being included in the Bill, or words to that effect, we feel that the effectiveness of the Bill will be largely minimised. In the debate on 30th March, my hon. Friend, in dealing with the important point of coercion or intimidation, raised the case of one employer. But that is not an isolated case. He gave an example of one employer who could have been a Protestant employer, whose employees forced him to discriminate against Catholic employees. As it happened, my hon. Friend's case was the other way round and concerned a Catholic employer, intimidated or coerced by Catholic employees to adopt a course of action which he did not wish to adopt.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel, therefore, that we must have a clear definition in the Bill which makes illegal, industrial action or the threat of industrial action by an employee to further an act of discrimination against another employee on grounds of religious belief or political opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to what my hon. Friend said on 30th March, when he gave an example to which I have referred, he also touched upon the great cost to an employer which may well arise simply because of strife between his employees on these grounds. He asked the Minister, quite pungently I thought, to give an illustration of how an employer, caught in such a trap as this where his employees are disputing the right of another employee to employment, can secure any form of recompense for what might be a heavy financial loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I conclude, I want to refer to the enforcement of the different requirements of the Bill. There is no penalty clause in the Bill, and if this new clause is accepted, as we hope on this side that it will be, it is no use putting a new clause into an enactment if there is no reference in the Bill to a penalty clause regarding its enforcement. I think this matter is of such importance that it should not be fobbed off by a reference to the Act of 1969 to which the hon. Member referred on 30th March.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment seems to me to bring within the scope of the Bill religious and political discrimination by employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provision has already been made for dealing with discriminatory pressure by employees. Under Clause 34, employees who aid, incite, direct, procure or induce, whether by threats or otherwise, other persons to do acts which are unlawful under the Bill are treated as though they themselves had done those acts and can thus be subject to the procedures and remedies which the Bill provides for dealing with unlawful discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, as the hon. Gentleman said, Section 1 of the Protection of the Person and Property Act (Northern Ireland) 1969 makes it a criminal offence for any person unlawfully to cause, by force, threats or menaces, or in any way whatsoever, other people to leave employment, to terminate the services of employees, or to refrain from doing any act. Where threats or intimida-
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
tion are used directly against an employee or a prospective employee, we think that the criminal law, not the agency, is the appropriate means for dealing with the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman can see, basically the Bill covers this situation, but there are always two ways in which the law in Northern Ireland covers the points in the new clause. In view of my explanation, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will see fit not to press the new clause to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is most grateful for what the Under-Secretary has said. He gave us an indication earlier that there was protection under this other legislation. It does not, however, cover the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr), and by me, about the financial loss to which an employer could be put by doing his duty under the legislation against the wishes of the worker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The agency will first work very much towards conciliation. In the last resort, however—and I think that this covers the point—the courts can award damages or can grant an injunction. The hon. Gentleman has obviously been doing his homework, and he will see that in the 1969 Act there are some strong penalty provisions. I hope that will go some way to satisfying the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

morning. We are delighted to accept both Amendments Nos. 48 and 57.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I shall not waste the time of the Committee any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 50, in page 45, line 28, leave out "pensions".</p>

	<p>No. 59, in Schedule 2, page 48, line 31, leave out "pensions".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Flushed with success, Mrs. Jeger, I raise a further point which also relates, like the amendment which has just been accepted, to the future nature and standing, as it were, of this agency. I am sure it is the wish of all members of the Committee that the members of the agency should in no sense be identified with any sort of bureaucrat. They are there in the public service in a quite different sense. It is their prestige and personal authority which is going to give the agency the best chance of success. If that is agreed, my hon. Friends and I find it surprising and, at first sight, objectionable that their offices should be pensionable and that their remuneration should include allowances for expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take those two points separately, although they are both covered by the amendments which you, Mrs. Jeger, have directed should be taken together. First, especially after the amendment to the Bill which the Committee has made, it seems absurd and contrary to the nature of the agency as we have been envisaging it that it should be a pensionable employment. I cannot believe that, although we hope in many cases they will be reappointed, persons who have been selected for this duty for a period, initially, of three years will either expect that that service should contribute to their retirement pension or regard it as the kind of office to which they should look for a supplement to their income in
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
retirement. Indeed, I go so far as to say—and I am sure that this will not be misunderstood—that they ought not to be the sort of people who will regard this as a pensionable office when they undertake it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am one of those who felt that this House took a step down when membership of the House became a pensionable occupation. If that is so, 	<i>a fortiori</i> the occupation of a position as a member of the agency seems to us to be one which is grotesquely inappropriate for the accumulation of pension rights. I hope that that point will be taken by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the tender matter of allowances for expenses. Again, I think there is an important difference between an employee or an officer of the agency and the agency itself. I understand the convenience in the case of certain types of employ. There are certain offices where there should be an allowance for expenses. It avoids administrative complications; it is convenient for the person concerned, and it can be so controlled that the risk of abuse is minimal. But I simply do not see that the functions of the agency are such that, in addition to the obvious right to reclaim expenses incurred specifically in the discharge of their duties, the members, or even the chairman—though I would be willing to see him placed in a different position if the Minister insisted—should receive expense allowances. All members of the Committee know how expense allowances tend to smell. We do not want anything associated with this agency that will tend to smell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are to be allowances as well as remuneration and, possibly, gratuities for the chairman and the members of the Board. I do not believe that their status will be enhanced by the specific provision for allowances for expenses. I look forward, therefore, to an assurance that both pensions for service and allowance for expenses lie outside the scope and nature of the agency here being set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks to Amendment No. 50, standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) and myself, and limit my discussion to pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary may be rough in voice this morning but his approach to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
the Committee is very gentle, and we appreciated the manner in which he accepted Amendment No. 48.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that it is not contemplated that the chairman and other members of the agency shall serve for a long time, that they will not start as striplings and grow grey in the service. We are glad to hear that, because we do not want the agency to become an enormous new apparatus. We do not want it to develop into an industry, and on this side of the Committee we hope that it will not assume the proportions—still less indulge in the absurdities—of some agencies already dealing with racial or sex discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not, therefore, see the need to provide for pensions and, in accepting Amendment No. 50, the hon. Gentleman will only be acting logically following his acceptance of Amendment No. 48.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, want to speak briefly on Amendments Nos. 50 and 59. I share the objections of my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) to the inclusion of pensions or anything like that in Schedule 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am naive enough to hope that one day—perhaps, before long—there may be no need for the Fair Employment Agency. Surely, whether I am naive or not, that must be the aim and desire of all members of the Committee. Yet here we propose to set up an agency which, unfortunately, we think necessary, and not only set it up but in Schedule 1 to provide its members with pensionable status and, moreover, authorise the Minister to make payments for pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, the very inclusion of the word "pensions" in the two places where it occurs in Schedule 1 is almost a confession of defeat. I hope that this Fair Employment Agency will be wound up long before any of its officers reach pensionable age, and that it will be wound up because there is no need for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wondered, when we were looking for the normal standards which apply to such amendments, why there were objections to it. The Sex Discrimination Act and the Race Relations Bill have comparable provisions. That might be the clue as to why there are some objections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
This amendment would delete allowances for expenses and pensions from the list of payments that the Department of Manpower Services, with the approval of the Department of Finance, may make to the chairman and other members of the agency. The provision for payment of allowances generally would remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The specific provision for allowances for expenses was inserted to make it quite clear that allowances could include allowances for expenses. The chairman and members of the agency will, for example, be required to do a considerable amount of travelling in fulfilling such duties as surveying patterns of employment and investigating cases of alleged discrimination which will require them to travel to firms or organisations in any part of Northern Ireland. It would be unjust if the Department of Manpower Services could not reimburse members for the expenses involved. I do not think there are any differences between us on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no mandatory provision that the Department of Manpower Services must provide for pensions for the chairman and members of the agency. It is just a provision that the Department may make such a provision. The provision, if any, for a pension must, of course, be dependent on the length of time served by a member of the agency. Where the period of service is of short duration it would probably be inappropriate to make any provision for a pension. On the other hand if a member serves the agency for a long period, it would be equally unjust not to make some provision for a pension. The Department must have the flexibility to decide whether or not to make provision for a pension according to the individual circumstances of each member, including length of service with the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are normal standards which are applied to different people and agencies of this kind. I could instance certain other bodies in Northern Ireland to which they apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to pensions and the setting up of the agency, I hope that there will be no necessity for any officer to serve for any specific period from the agency's inception to the time when he would be of pensionable age. We must have the flexibility to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary said that it was not mandatory on the Department to provide pensions, but he wants it to be possible to provide them. Perhaps on reflection, if it turned out to be desirable to provide pensions, he may feel that he should return and seek to obtain the approval of the House for such a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the Government must have noted the unease in the Committee about this paragraph as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) made a very telling point when he distinguished this agency from other bodies which, rightly or wrongly, are envisaged by our legislation as more or less permanent branches of the constitution. I hoped that from the Committee generally there would be agreement with his proposition that we hoped that we were doing something which would prove terminable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we should be bound by precedent constituted by other bodies. I do not know what other Northern Ireland bodies the Under-Secretary had in mind. I hope that he was not thinking of bodies such as the Housing Executive. If so, I must tell him that in the view of my hon. Friends and myself and, I am sure, many other Members of the Committee, the members of this agency will do a very different kind of job and be in a very different situation from that which is proper to the members of the Housing Executive. Therefore, I do not feel that the hon. Gentleman has succeeded in removing the difficulties and objections which a number of us have on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I followed with interest the points made by the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison). I find it difficult to believe that, if for 25 years a person has rendered distinguished service, first, as member and then as chairman of the agency, there should be no channels or resources available to the Government to recognise such an exceptional claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we are putting in a provision which will be regarded as normal. It may be subject to the Department, but it will become regarded as normal if we allow it to stand in this schedule. I do not believe that "pensions" should be there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
I turn now to the lesser matter of "allowances for expenses." The hon. Gentleman raised a query in my mind, for he substituted the word "reimbursement" for the word "allowances" in the example which he gave. Of course, "reimbursement" goes without saying and is provided for, as far as I understand, in paragraph 12. But I see no reason why, as a lot of travelling is to be undertaken by the chairman or members of the agency, they should have an allowance for travelling expenses. They should have reimbursement. We cover a great deal of mileage in our constituencies, particularly in Northern Ireland. In the way in which it is meant here, there is no allowance for expenses, but there is the right to reimbursement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is saying that expenses incurred by members of the agency shall be reimbursed and are reimbursable, I do not imagine that anybody will object. But that is not the normal meaning of "allowances for expenses" in this hard, rough world. The normal meaning of "allowances for expenses" is a sum of so many hundred pounds—"And that, my dear sir, is your allowance for expenses." It is that sense of the word which I was querying in this paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman makes it clear that "allowances for expenses" cannot be interpreted as an allowance unrelated to specific claims for reimbursement, I should regard the difficulty as greatly lessened. I hope that he will address himself to that point as well as to the issue of pensions, which has been pressed upon him from more than one quarter in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to put the record straight, because the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) has referred to unease in the Committee about these provisions being made. I assure my right hon. Friend that there would have been even greater unease had these provisions not been contained somewhere in the Bill. I will explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that if the agency is to do its work effectively, it must have a suitable chairman and members. Therefore, my right hon. Friend must have the broadest possible list of available people from whom a choice can be made. The criteria must relate to the functions of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
the agency and the Act, not to the ability of the individual to subsidise his own expenses or to make sacrifices of pension rights in his present occupation or in any occupation which he may subsequently follow when he ceases to serve with the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are all too many institutions with which individuals are invited to serve, but who can do so only if two other criteria are satisfied. First, they must manage to survive without receiving adequate reimbursement for out of pocket expenses. Difficulties often arise in trying to calculate what is a properly reimbursable expense. It would be more satisfactory if there were a modest allowance which could be paid without quibble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to being able to defray one's own expenses, to a degree, there is the second criteria—that an individual must make a sacrifice by interrupting and departing from his normal occupation in order to perform a public service and, at the end of a relatively short period, then trying to pick up the threads of that career where he left off. If we were to add to that a diminution of pension benefits, as a result of such public service, it would be unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is surely right to provide that an individual's retirement rights will be assured, not undermined, as a result of his service with the agency. I am glad, therefore, that these provisions are contained in the Bill and that my right hon. Friend will not be inhibited in any way from applying the appropriate criterion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham) that there is no disposition on what he might call the uneasy side of the Committee to do those appointed to the agency out of their due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary, when commenting on the amendment, did not say that the purpose was to make sure that those appointed to the agency would have pension rights in their previous employment secured. That was not his argument. I understood—I may be wrong—that he was speaking of pensions connected with service with the agency. Indeed, he fully took the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr), that it was not envisaged that these ladies and gentlemen
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
would grow grey in the service of the agency. Indeed, the hope was expressed that, after a while, the agency might prove to be unnecessary, in which event it could be wound up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I suggest that it would be reasonable for the Government to accept the amendment relating to pensions. If circumstances changed and something needed to be done to ensure that those serving the agency were properly treated, the matter could be brought before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has disclosed some degree of misunderstanding and, perhaps, difference of intention regarding the agency. The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) has referred to those "serving the agency." We are, of course, talking only about the members of the agency itself. It appeared from a number of comments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I said "serving the agency", I meant that the chairman and members of the agency would be giving service to the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. I did not intend to be captious. I simply want to make it clear that we are talking not about the servants of the agency in the ordinary sense of the term, but about the members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess—it is as well that this point should be cleared up at this stage—that I have envisaged the members of the agency as part-time in the strong sense of that term. I imagine them exercising a directing function which will involve periodic sub-committee and committee work and, in the case of the chairman, a certain amount of supervisory activity. It is leadership, not administration, which is the function of the agency. It is policy and judgment, not execution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not correspond to the notion which I formed—and we might as well compare notes on this at this stage—that members of the agency would have anything like daily duties as such. On the contrary, especially after the agency was working, I would hope that periodical reviews by the full agency and by groups of the agency of progress by officials and consideration of particularly difficult cases or policy decisions would be the work of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
I assure the hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham) that there was no intention on my part that a person whose membership of the agency took him away from his career or employment should not be compensated for that. It had not occurred to me that people would be taken away from other activities and employment to that extent by the work of the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman not agree from his own departmental experience—I am thinking of an analogy which does not perhaps match the responsibilities entailed in the agency—that the selection of chairmen of regional hospital boards was from a very restricted list because one had to look to people who could give of their time, and that other members of hospital boards were limited in number, or did they all come from one party so that there was no problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty, though I feel there may be hovering somewhere a clinching argument. I cannot recall at the moment whether membership of a regional hospital board is a pensionable appointment. My guess is that it is not. It certainly was not in my time, and this was not one of the problems that were encountered. Many of the members of hospital boards—this excludes the chairmen—were drawn from all manner of employments and occupations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would accept the analogy of a regional hospital board as the upper limit of the sort of activity which I had envisaged in the case of the agency. It would be interesting to know how the matter of pension stands with bodies such as regional hospital boards whose work, generally, is rather more intensive than what one had envisaged for this agency, and is certainly more continuous and permanent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had quite a debate on this subject, and I thank the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) for saying basically part of what I was going to say in reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman looks at paragraph 136 of the working party's report he will see that it is recommended that the agency should have a full-time chairman. To a full-time chairman, the loss of five years' pension entitlement would be very serious. As I understand it, unless a member of the agency has a pension from contributions to his credit when he leaves
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
the agency he will not be able to buy his pension credit with the organisation to which he moves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly not intended that all members of the agency will be full time, although in some instances they could be. The provisions that we are discussing are the normal provisions and we do not see any ground for departing from them. It is not intended that the allowances to which the right hon. Gentleman referred will lead to massive over-payment of expenses, but provision is made for the right administrative flexibility. If the right hon. Gentleman looks at his own car allowance form he will see that it is headed "car allowance", but one could call that allowance a reimbursement, and it is the same sort of technicality that we have here. I am advised that these are the normal provisions in legislation of this kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham), who expressed his views in a very forthright manner, may have been confused about the position of the agency staff. As he will see by looking further down Schedule 1, proper provision is made for staff. Earlier in our proceedings we discussed the number of full-time staff, which I think was about 30 to 34. Of course they will be pensionable, and that is provided for later in Schedule 1. No amendments have been tabled anyway in relation to staff pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, what we are considering relates to pensions and other matters, including the expenses of the agency members. There is a definite division of opinion on this matter. My purpose in rising is to ask you, Mrs. Jeger, whether, as Amendments Nos. 49, 50, 58 and 59 have been grouped together, and as Nos. 50 and 59 are really allied to pensions and Nos. 49 and 58 to pensions and other matters, you would be prepared to put the amendments to the Committee separately in the two groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I am happy to assure the Committee that those amendments can be separately considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was proposing to ask leave, Mrs. Jeger, to withdraw Amendment No. 49 in order that the Committee could come to a conclusion separately on the matter of pensions. I merely draw attention to the fact that the Government have stated that it is their concept that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0305">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
chairman would be full-time. If so, I think that ought to be shown in the Bill. If we are setting up an agency with a full-time chairman, it is right that that should be stated. I see that some research is being done and perhaps, therefore, I am not holding matters up by reinforcing my point. I am sure that in other cases, part-time and full-time members and chairmen of statutory bodies have been distinguished. Of course, I admit that if the chairman is to be full-time, different considerations apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the right hon. Gentleman. Based on the report—and I have given some attention to this—I am at present considering names for the appointment of a full-time chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. It is a very important matter—indeed, more important than most other matters in the schedule. At a later stage, we should consider whether this should not appear on the face of the Bill, and whether, therefore, the pension should not be related to the full-time employment of the chairman. If that were done, I think it would be better legislation and it would remove, at any rate, some of my difficulties about the appearance of the term "pension".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will look at this. Obviously, I have not had time to consult officials about this matter. I have made clear that it is the Government's intention to appoint a full-time chairman. The appeals situation is rather different, but for the agency it is essential. I shall look at the matter before Report to see whether it is necessary to encompass such a provision in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very good of the Minister to say that he will look at this point. We appreciate it. However, I am not sure that I wish to have written into the Bill that the chairman shall be full-time. Experience might tell us that it is not necessary for the chairman to be full-time. We hope that the agency will have very little to do. We hope that there will be a remarkable improvement in the matter of discrimination in Northern Ireland. Indeed, I sometimes think that the degree of discrimination is exaggerated. Therefore, I am somewhat doubtful whether we should write into the Bill that the chairman should be full-time. But I am not being
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
dogmatic and I am extremely glad that the Minister of State is considering all the arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we have made progress. It is clear that, both the right hon. Gentlemen and, therefore, the rest of us are in 	<i>mediis rebus</i>—in the middle of it, if that is not too rough a translation, Mrs. Jeger. We really ought to have the opportunity of coming back to this matter at the next stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could say that the pension provision would appear to be justifiable only in so far as it was linked with full-time service. I see the force of the point of the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) that we should not tie ourselves to a full-time chairman. On the other hand, if we are not to tie ourselves to a full-time chairman I do not think we should tie ourselves to pension either. By mentioning it here we are, in fact, going very far towards tying ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the right hon. Gentleman giving indications of assent and I hope, therefore, that it will be agreed that we can leave the issue at that point on the understanding, that we come back to it on Report when the right hon. Gentleman will have carried these considerations further.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>Amendment proposed: No. 50, in page 45, line 28, leave out "pensions".</p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 51, in page 46, line 11, leave out "in the first instance".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to my hon. Friends and me that there is a sort of conundrum here which we are trying to solve. As the sub-paragraph stands, it seems that the agency could start at a meeting attended by five of its members by fixing a quorum, say, of four members. But at the next meeting where the quorum was four, they could decide that the quorum should be only two. I may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
have got it wrong. But it looks as though it is only in the first instance that the meeting which determines the size of a quorate meeting has to be as large as five. Therefore, the sub-paragraph as it stands is regressive, as it were, in its effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apprehend that this cannot be the intention. Therefore, I hope that the Under-Secretary will either be able to explain where my reasoning has gone astray or else indicate that the conundrum will be resolved in some other fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment to paragraph 6(2) of the schedule is inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph 6(1) which provides that the agency may regulate its own procedure and, subject to paragraph 6(2), its quorum. Paragraph 6(2) provides that in the first instance the agency shall determine its quorum by a meeting of "not less than five members."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it is logically necessary to make provision in the first instance for the minimum number of members required to establish the quorum for subsequent meetings, that necessity does not continue. The agency as an independent body must be left to regulate its own affairs. The general principle is that the agency has control of its own procedures but logically there must be a quorum for the first meeting that dictates its own procedures from that point onward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious not to take up the time of the Committee, but I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has seen the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect, there is no inconsistency between my amendment and sub-paragraph (1), because as there is a saving for sub-paragraph (2) in sub-paragraph (1), however we amend sub-paragraph (2), the latter cannot be inconsistent with sub-paragraph (1). I hope the hon. Gentleman will not persist with that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come again to the point. Clearly it is felt—indeed, the terms of sub-paragraph (1) say so—that the quorum is too important a matter to be left at large. But if it is too important to be left at large, we should not be content with merely regulating it for one meeting. We should regulate it generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
Clearly by sub-paragraph (2) we are withdrawing from the agency the right to determine its quorum. I am not trying to make heavy weather of this, but if we are saying that there should be a minimum quorum, let us do so plainly and not in this manner which closes the door in order merely to throw it open again after the first meeting. Either the agency should decide its quorum or we should decide it by statute. We have a very unhappy mixture at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. Gentleman has taken my point. It is serious but small, and I hope he will look at it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman said, the general principle is that the agency will be running its own procedure. The Bill must say what the quorum should be for the first meeting. Thereafter, with the agency running its own procedure, it can make its own decisions. I am sure that is right, but at the outset, when the agency is being set up, there must be a fairly large quorum for its first meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 53, in page 46, line 36, leave out "chairman" and insert "Agency".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 54, in page 47, leave out lines 3 and 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seemed to my hon. Friends and myself that the chairman was here being given an excessive power. Construing the paragraph, it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Agency may authorise the discharge … of its functions in relation to … any class … of matters by a member or a group of members … selected by the chairman."</p></blockquote>
What does that mean? Does it mean that it can pass on authority saying that either one of its members, or a group of its members, selected by the chairman, can discharge the agency's functions in relation to any class of matter; or does it mean that the chairman selects A, B and C and the agency then authorises A, B and C to discharge certain or—conceivably, because A and B put together are comprehensive—all its functions? That is not clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not seem right that the chairman by himself should be able, subject to a general authorisation of the agency, to say
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
to A "You go and do that" and to B and C "You go and do this and whatever you do in that connection will have the full authority of the agency."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be that sort of delegation, while the nomination of the individuals might well be the proper function of the chairman, the delegation itself and the delegation in terms of the persons nominated, ought to be the work of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope this matter can be cleared up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman said in moving the amendment, this amendment to paragraph 10(1) of Schedule 1 seeks to reduce the powers of the Chairman of the Fair Employment Agency by requiring the agency, rather than the chairman, to select a member or group of members to discharge the agency's functions in certain specified matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman requires to have these powers of selection in order to enable the agency to respond quickly when required to cope with urgent problems and to provide administrative flexibility since, as my right hon. Friend said earlier, it is probable that the chairman will be the only full-time member of the agency and, therefore, the only one immediately available for decision taking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the agency is to provide a quick and efficient service to the community, its chairman requires this authority, and I hope the Committee will reject this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think perhaps the difficulty arises in the words selected rather than the word "chairman" in itself. Does the hon. Member envisage that the agency will pass a resolution saying that the chairman can select anybody he likes to do any of the following things?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alternatively, does it mean "We authorise to do any of the following things the following people, which people have been selected by the chairman?" If the latter is the meaning, there is no difficulty, but if the former is the meaning, in effect the agency is putting the whole operation of the agency into commission with the chairman. I see that the right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) has seized the nature of my anxiety. That formula is the best way in which I can express it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
The Opposition do not think it should be possible for the agency to put into permanent commission with the chairman any of its functions to be exercised by himself or by those selected by him. If that anxiety, either at this stage or subsequently, can be removed, we should be relieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that it could be either of the two alternatives which the right hon. Gentleman has given. The delegation of the functions requires the agency to authorise it and it will remain under the agency's general direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that explanation is satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this be the first Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one query on this matter which perhaps the right hon. Gentleman could clear up. It is a puzzle which relates to paragraph 12. I cannot understand why approval of the Department of Manpower Services and the Department of Finance to expenditure incurred by or on behalf of the agency does not have to be given in writing. I cannot see why individual authorisations can be verbal whereas general authorisations have to be written. There seems to be a problem here, and if the hon. Gentleman can explain that, I should be obliged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Approval for expenditure not covered by the general authorisation will normally be obtained in writing, but there may well be occasions when it will be necessary to obtain oral approval, since the urgency of the situation will preclude the agency from obtaining written approval. It is not normal in legislation of this nature to require written approval for all expenditure, nor is written approval specified in other parts of the schedule, such as paragraphs 5(1) and (2) which require the agency to obtain the approval of the Department of Manpower Services and the Department of Finance, as to remuneration and other payments to employees of the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an appropriate amendment. I was unable to understand how head (	<i>a</i>) in paragraph 7(3) could prejudice the provisions of Clause 52 (1). I shall, therefore, be obliged to receive an explanation of that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Government's intention that those provisions should extend to the maximum possible extent to the Crown. Therefore, Clause 52(1) removes for the purpose of investigation appeals and proceedings under the Bill, the usual restrictions on people in Crown service regarding disclosure of information, and removes the right to refuse to give information on the grounds of Crown privilege. Instead, by Clause 52(2), a Minister of the Crown or head of the Northern Ireland Department may certify that disclosure would be prejudicial to the safety of the United Kingdom, or any part of it, or otherwise contrary to public interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will only take up a moment or two, but perhaps I could put the question a little more at large.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
How can the fact that a person is not compelled to produce any information prejudice the provisions of either subsection (1) or (2) regarding disclosure of information? Does it mean that the Crown can be compelled to produce what a private person would not be compelled to produce? I find difficulty in construing these two provisions together.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 63, in page 51, line 26, leave out from "for" to end of line 27 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"any loss of earnings or profits".</p></blockquote>
The anxiety in the minds of my hon. Friends and myself was that loss of time might be a restrictive basis of calculation for persons whose earnings and remuneration were not drawn on a time basis. Clearly, there are many professions where the loss of the time involved would not be an adequate measure of the loss incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to elicit the answer to that difficulty—if there is one—we suggest that
	<br><blockquote><p>"loss of earnings or profits"</p></blockquote>
might leave more at large the ascertainment of and compensation for the losses incurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could reply to the right hon. Gentleman and possibly help the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr). I understand the purpose behind the amendment to include
	<br><blockquote><p>"loss of earnings or profits".</p></blockquote>
But it is an established fact within Government practice that to define profits or earnings is extremely difficult. The normal practice is to give an allowance. That covers all people, whether they are pensioners, people who are unemployed or
	<span class='label label-info column'>560</span>
otherwise. Acceptance of the amendment would involve giving different rates of compensation, and to endeavour to compile these would be extremely difficult. For that reason, I ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider withdrawing his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to say a word or two about the amendment. It appears to me that, despite what the Minister said it is possible for payments to be made inappropriately. I have in mind the words in page 51, line 26,
	<br><blockquote><p>"allowances by way of compensation for the loss of his time".</p></blockquote>
First, I imagine that it should be "his or her time", but that is a minor point. Despite what the Minister said—that that is the jargon or phraseology normally used by Government Departments in framing Bills of this nature—it seems to be woolly and open to unfair interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the difficulty of being able to assess the worth of a person's loss of time. Obviously in certain cases—for example, a shift worker who can indicate what he would have earned on his shift—the loss of earnings can be readily established. But there is the difficulty—here I am with the Minister—about establishing the rate, for instance, for a lawyer, a housewife, a dockyard worker or an agricultural worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Difficult though the Government find it to accept that we should replace "loss of his time" by
	<br><blockquote><p>"any loss of earnings or profits",</p></blockquote>
obviously, if we could get the purpose of the amendment into the schedule, the Bill would be much improved. It is difficult, but the Government are here to surmount such difficulties. It is not an impossible task. The schedule, as drafted, is unsatisfactory and not at all definitive as to its intentions. I fully support the amendment and hope that the Minister will be a little more forthcoming on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply made it clear—I confess that my hon. Friends and I were not aware of this when we put down the amendment—that sub-paragraph (	<i>b</i>), as drafted, means flat-rate allowances 	<i>pro rata</i> to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It so happens that I have in hand with the Secretary of State the discussion of a particular case which may be relevant by way of illustration. It relates to payments to witnesses in a High Court case. In that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
instance, the normal provision is for flat-rate time allowances. Nevertheless, I have ascertained from the Secretary of State—I am hoping that it will apply to my constituent—that it is possible for specific circumstances to be taken into account. The case that I have in mind relates to the skipper of a fishing boat. I should be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman would satisfy himself that there will be the means to take account of profits and earnings in special circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previously I elicited from the right hon. Gentleman the undertaking that he would write to me. I shall be happy to write to him and supply supporting details of the instance I have in mind.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There lies behind all these amendments the single and simple point that there will come into the possession of the agency a vast amount of information. Provided that it is divested of any means of identifying particular persons or firms, the agency and its officers ought reasonably to be allowed to use that information freely. Therefore, it seemed to my hon. Friends and myself that the clause was drawn more restrictively than necessary, provided that the reservation were made for information relating to an identifiable firm or person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose behind these amendments, therefore, is not merely a simplification but is to ensure that, provided we can set on one side and fully protect the identi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
fiable information, there is no let or hindrance upon the agency or its officers making use of information which they have obtained in the course of their duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I give one example of the sort of case we have in mind? Let us suppose that the agency is engaged in one of its conciliation procedures. It is trying to bring about a settlement upon certain terms. I see no reason why the agency or its officers should have any inhibition in saying to the employer and the employee, "As a matter of fact, we have a case where such-and-such was alleged, and we found that such-and-such was the outcome, which is why we are making this recommendation to you now with considerable confidence."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided that the agency or its officers in those circumstances does not go on to say that it was such-and-such a firm, or does not disclose information which points unambiguously to a particular firm, we ought not to hang restrictions around the use which the agency makes of unidentifiable material which comes into its possession. That is the purpose of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the intention of the right hon. Gentleman in this series of amendments. However, in effect, they would widen the scope of disseminating information, perhaps sometimes confidential information, which would not be to the advantage of the people concerned. Information could be confidential even if it was not about individuals. The agency, as the right hon. Gentleman has previously stated, has strong powers to demand information, and it is only fair that that information should be not made freely available. The powers proposed by the right hon. Gentleman could restrict the operations of the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some difficulty in envisaging a type of information which would be both confidential and not relate to any identifiable firm or person. Indeed, I think that that was the difficulty which prompted these amendments. However, as the right hon.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this be the Fifth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wanted to make a couple of comments on this schedule. On the last group of amendments and the confidentiality of information in subsection (12), I should like the Minister to say a word on the anonymity of those who give evidence or information. Do the regulations provide for anonymity to be respected? Is there any consideration that those who provide evidence or information to the agency or to the work contained in this Bill should have their anonymity respected if they so desire?

The other point I wish to raise in relation to paragraph 11 refers to expenses, which are apparently going to be paid in accordance with a scale laid down. How often will this scale be changed? I imagine that the Chancellor's Budget will affect the scale of payment. Do people who claim expenses under paragraph 11 get an up-to-date expense allowance with, for example, the increased cost of petrol and other increases taken into account, or, as is so often the case, when expenses are put in for by those who at their own time and expense make long journeys to appear in matters of this nature, are those expenses months or even years out of date? What assurance can the right hon. Gentleman give in this respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Expenses are changed as and when appropriate. The hon. Gentleman is aware that this is done on Government scales and it is done at the appropriate time. Obviously, inflation and other matters are taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point that the hon. Gentleman raised, the Bill is not explicit about confidentiality, but obviously the agency will have power to take that point into account should somebody specifically ask about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do now report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before you close the proceedings, Mrs. Jeger, may I on behalf of the Committee thank you for the great
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
courtesy and humour with which you have conducted the Committee. I think the whole Committee will wish to thank you also for the work that you have done. May I say on behalf of the Government that this Committee has been extremely important. We have learned a lot, and our deliberations will, I am sure, speed the enactment of the Bill. On that basis, Mrs. Jeger, the Government look forward to its speedy passage on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should like to join the right hon. Gentleman in everything that he has said, and we congratulate you, Mrs. Jeger, on your conduct of our proceedings. It is a great encouragement to Members of the House to have a Chairman who takes such a great interest in the proceedings and in the very thorough examination of this important Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Jeger, perhaps I may be allowed to give the evidence of one who has, unlike some others, attended the proceedings of the Committee throughout, and add support to the exceptional validity of the customary tributes which are being paid on this occasion. You have, in fact, personally helped the Committee through what has been a quite exhaustive but, as the right hon. Gentleman says, useful Committee stage. I should like to respond to the concluding words of the right hon. Gentleman, the Minister of State, by saying that his own generosity and open-mindedness have been greatly appreciated by my hon. Friends and myself and have certainly facilitated the passage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that my sentiments have been adequately expressed, Mrs. Jeger, by the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, and my only reason for rising to my feet is to congratulate you on the way in which you have chaired the Committee. Secondly, I should like to establish the fact that I have been here this morning. I did not intervene in earlier debates because I wanted to see the Bill make progress. I think it may have been forgotten, Mrs. Jeger, that during one stage of the Committee proceedings you had laryngitis, in spite of which you managed to chair the Committee successfully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
