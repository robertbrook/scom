	<p>[Mr. ARTHUR JONES 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>INDUSTRIAL COMMON OWNERSHIP BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That if the proceedings on the Industrial Common Ownership Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet again on Wednesday 7th July 1976 at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. David Watkins.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the remainder of the Bill be considerd in the following order: new Clause (Common ownership enterprises and co-operative enterprises), new Clause (Grants and loans), Clause 3, Clause 7, Clause 8, and any remaining new Clauses and new Schedules.</p></q>
I remind the Committee that at the last sitting the Committee and the Chair found some difficulty because of the extensive proposals for redrafting which had been tabled somewhat late. This motion arises from the discussion and the views expressed by hon. Members last week. I hope that the Committee will agree that it is acceptable to consider the Bill in the proposed order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it will probably suit the Committee if we do exactly that. It is a sensible arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONVERSION TO COMMON OWNERSHIP ENTERPRISE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>—[	<i>23rd June</i>]—That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the Question we were discussing when the Committee rose last week, and it would be appropriate if I explained some of the reasons for the proposed deletion of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important clause, and the only alteration of any real substance which is proposed in the Bill arises from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
deletion of the clause. I recall that on Second Reading the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) rightly said that it was a clause which required rigorous examination, and at our last sitting the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Price) felt that an explanation should be given of why it was proposed that the clause should not stand part of the Bill. I agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The omission of the clause does not in any way preclude the conversion of companies into common ownership enterprises, which can take place under existing legislation. Indeed, a number of them have so taken place. I remind the Committee that Scott Bader Commonwealth was a conversion made no less than a quarter of a century ago under existing law, and more recently, the Airflow Community at High Wycombe has also been converted under existing law. The main point I make is that the withdrawal of the clause, which specifically refers to conversions, does not in any way preclude conversions from taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause was intended to simplify the procedure for conversions but, regrettably, investigation showed that eliminating certain problems would create others which could well be worse than those we were seeking to eliminate. First, I refer to the creation of loan stock, which is proposed in the clause. I am advised that the total extinction of share capital would damage creditors. Hon. Members will be aware that in the event of a failure creditors take priority over shareholders, so, clearly, as was stated on Second Reading, there could be difficulties there. There is also the fact that such loan stock would have to be serviced and repaid at the end of the loan period, which could conceivably be a difficult and insupportable burden on a firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a much wider scale, there is no existing machinery within company law for the conversion of shares into loan stock. To create such machinery would be a complex matter beyond the scope of a Private Member's Bill. It may be said that one of the virtues of the Bill is that it has highlighted the need for a general revision of company law in the light of developments which are taking place. It is a problem Governments of all complexions have thought about, and which needs to be tackled by the Government on a long-term basis.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
I feel some regret at the withdrawal of the clause, but it would create difficulties greater than those which it was intended to resolve, and its proposals are more complex than was expected when we originally drafted the Bill. For those
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
reasons, I have to advise the Committee that the clause should not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>COMMON OWNERSHIP ENTERPRISES AND CO-OPERATIVE ENTERPRISES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>' .—(1) For the purposes of this Act a common ownership enterprise is a body as to which the registrar has given, and has not revoked, a certificate stating that he is satisfied—
	<ol>
	<li>that the body is—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>a company which has no share capital, is limited by guarantee and is a bona fide co-operative society; or</li>
	<li>a society registered or deemed to be registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts 1965 to 1975; and</li></ol>
	<li>that the memorandum or articles of association or rules of the body include provisions which secure—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>that only persons who are employed by, or by a subsidiary of, the body may be members of it, that (subject to any provision about qualifications for membership which is from time to time made by the members of the body by reference to age, length of service or other factors of any description) all such persons may be members of the body and that members have equal voting rights at meetings of the body,</li>
	<li>that the assets of the body are applied only for the purposes of objects of the body which do not include the making over of assets to any member of the body except for value and except in pursuance of arrangements for sharing the profits of the body among its members, and</li>
	<li>that, if on the winding-up or dissolution of the body any of its assets remain to be disposed of after its liabilities are satisfied, the assets are not distributed among its members but are transferred to such a common ownership enterprise or such a central fund maintained for the benefit of common ownership enterprises as may be determined by the members at or before the time of the winding-up or dissolution or, in so far as the assets are not so transferred, are held for charitable purposes.</li></ol></ol></p>
	<p>(2) For the purposes of this Act a co-operative enterprise is a body as to which the Secretary of State has given, and has not revoked, a certificate stating that he is satisffed that—
	<ol>
	<li>having regard to the provision which is made by the written constitution of the body as to the manner in which the income of the body is to be applied for the benefit of its members and all other relevant provisions of the constitution, the body is in substance a co-operative association; and</li>
	<li>the body is controlled by a majority of the people working for the body and of the people working for the subsidiaries, if any, of the body.</li></ol></p>
	<p>(3) The registrar may charge such a fee as the Treasury may determine for any certificate which he proposes to give in pursuance of this section, and any sum received by him in respect of such a fee shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund.</p>
	<p>(4) If it appears to the registrar or the Secretary of State that a body in respect of which he has given a certificate in pursuance of this section has ceased to be a common ownership enterprise or a co-operative enterprise, he may revoke the certificate.</p>
	<p>(5) In this section—

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first say, Mr. Jones, this being my first speech in the Committee, that we are pleased to see you in the Chair. I have been on a number of Bills in the past when you have been in the Chair, and I think it appropriate, since we are discussing something which, although it may be a small step forward in some ways is nevertheless, for those who have been campaigning for these developments, a very significant step forward, that somebody with a reputation for integrity and fairness in these matters should be our Chairman in a Committee such as this. We look forward to receiving the benefits of your wisdom, judgment and fairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I speak at length this morning. This is a rather complicated new clause designed to replace the original Clause 1 of the Bill. Basically, the new clause seeks to define for the purposes of the Bill what is meant by a common ownership enterprise and a co-operative enterprise. I know that those who have been campaigning for these improvements for many years, including my hon. Friend the Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins), feel that it is appropriate and right that we should seek the best possible definition and include all that we wish to include.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a vital clause and I hope that my hon. Friend will feel that the defini-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
tions to which I shall refer are broadly acceptable to him and to his hon. Friends, although I recognise that he has put down a couple of amendments. The new clause seeks to define a common ownership enterprise as a body to which the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies has given a certificate stating that he is satisfied about certain criteria relating to the structure of the body and the rules under which it functions. The Chief Registrar will be entitled to charge a fee for the issue of the certificate and, of course, the certificate may be revoked if it appears to the Chief Registrar that the body in question has ceased to be a common ownership enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that my hon. Friends and hon. Gentlemen opposite may be tempted to ask why it was necessary to amend the original Clause 1. One important difference is that in new Clause 2 the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies is limited to certifying on the basis of facts ascertainable by checking the relevant documents. My Department takes the view that it would not be right to expect the chief registrar to take on a very burdensome and, I think, unnecessary task of forming value judgments on the ownership and control of an enterprise which might necessitate substantial inquiries. Under the original Clause 1 that kind of inquiry would have been necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of new Clause 1 would widen the scope of the Bill to include co-operative enterprises. The subsection defines a co-operative enterprise as a body to which the Secretary of State has given a certificate stating that he is satisfied about certain criteria relating to the body's constitution and the way in which it is controlled. Again, the certificate may be revoked if it appears to the Secretary of State that the body in question has ceased to be a co-operative enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of subsection (3) of the old Clause 1 are not included in new Clause 2 because there seems to be no need to specify a minimum number of members for a common ownership enter-price or that the membership should comprise a specified proportion—for example, 65 per cent.—of those employed in the enterprise. The important points are that only employees should be eligible for membership of the enterprise,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
and that all employees should be entitled to be members, subject to provisions of qualification in appropriate cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move now to subsection (4) of the old Clause 1. There were two rather serious objections to that subsection. First, the limitation on the distribution of an enterprise's residual assets was confined in the old subsection (4) only to the circumstances of winding up or dissolution so that such assets might have been shared among the members prior to the business being formally dissolved. The new Clause 2 provisions will apply a restriction of this sort throughout the existence of the enterprise, so we are seeking to extend the provision in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the old Clause 1(4) imposed a function on the High Court to select a suitable distribution for the assets of a dissolved or wound-up enterprise in the event of the members failing to decide the matter. This, we feel, is not a proper function for the courts, and consequently it is provided in new Clause 2(	<i>b</i>)(iii) that such residual assets, in the absence of determination by the members, should be held for charitable purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now sum up my remarks at this stage. Basically, we seek to change the duties which will be imposed upon the registrar, particularly with regard to certification, as we do not think that he should have to deal with quite the burden of work originally proposed. Second, we seek to amend the definition of common ownership or co-operative enterprise, and we believe that the definition in the new clause is more fitting than that given in the original Clause 1. Then we seek to change certain provisions in the old clause on the distribution of funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends and the whole Committee will accept that these changes are necessary only as a result of the great deal of detailed research which has been done into what my hon. Friend originally proposed. It is not that we are unsympathetic to my hon. Friend's intentions. In fact, we support his ambitions. I do not say that we agree with him in every respect, but certainly we support the way in which he is going. But, having done some detailed research
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
and having analysed, perhaps rather clinically, the intentions of his original clause, we feel that new Clause 2 would be a better way to go about it. I hope that the Committee will accept it as part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation, but perhaps you could guide me here, Mr. Jones. There is a small difficulty because of the way the Bill has been so extensively rewritten in that we shall have to vote on the Question "That the clause stand part of the Bill" before voting on the amendments to it. The customary fashion, of course, is to consider first the amendments to a clause so that the shape of the clause is known before we vote to put it into the Bill. We are therefore in an awkward position. I appreciate, Mr. Jones, that it is not your fault. We all know whose fault it is—I do not use "fault" in a pejorative sense—and we know how the problem has arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Committee will be understanding if we get ourselves to a point when, although we have no rooted objection to new Clause 2, we may have to vote against it because we do not know whether the amendments which we think are essential will be carried at the end of the day. No doubt, the Minister will be able to help us by answering some of the queries which come to mind on his new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, would the London Co-operative Society, for example, be included as a bona fide co-operative enterprise within the meaning of the Bill, in terms of new Clause 2, or does paragraph (	<i>b</i>)(i) preclude that by the words
	<br><q><p>"only persons who are employed by, or by a subsidiary of, the body may be members of it".</p></q>
That seems to relate only to common enterprise bodies, and there is some doubt generally about whether the Bill has now been converted into something which will be of considerable potential benefit to the "co-ops" as they stand at the moment as well as to what we would broadly call common-owned enterprises. Whatever virtues the co-operative societies have, they are not what one would generally call common-owned enterprises. We do not want to go into the virtues or snags of the Co-operative movement, but I did not think that the Bill was about the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
"-co-ops" as we have known them, the London Co-operative Society and others. I am not sure that the new drafting has not made it into a Bill about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One understands the difficulties which arose in drafting the Bill, but there is some surprisingly broad drafting in this new clause. Paragraph (	<i>b</i>)(i) has these words:
	<br><q><p>"that only persons who are employed by, or by a subsidiary of, the body may be members of it, that (subject to any provision about qualifications for membership which is from time to time made by the members of the body by reference to age, length of service or other factors of any description)"—.</p></q>
I hope that the Minister will consider whether he will himself table an amendment here, or certainly on Report, to remove those words
	<br><q><p>"or other factors of any description".</p></q>
We are used to broad-brush drafting, but that is the broadest brush that I have seen for a long time in any legislation. For example, does it mean that these bodies alone would have the right to discriminate by reason of religion or race? They are, of course, "other factors of any description". Could we have a whites-only common-owned firm? It is not impossible that the members might decide that they would restrict membership to white people only. If so, would they be able to plead this Bill in mitigation. How would they fare when a case was brought against them under the Race Relations Act? Could they exclude Roman Catholics or Jews? Could they exclude Socialists or International Socialists, or Conservatives, Tribunites, or Fabians? It would appear that they could, and do so legally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put it quite as broadly as that is, I suggest, unwise. We should not give into the hands of any group of people power to discriminate in that way by reason of factors which have nothing to do with the enterprise itself. They could discriminate by having a men-only common ownership firm, or perhaps a women-only firm. It would appear to me that, when called to account for it, they could say "Yes, but Parliament has legislated to give us precisely this power. We are using it, and you cannot criticise as for using that power". Perhaps the Minister will tell us what he thinks about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know about other members of this Committee, but I always find diffi-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
culty in knowing exactly what legislation means until I have read it eight or 10 times and had it explained to me carefully on more occasions than that. I do not expect the Minister to use the time of the Committee in going through it too often for me, but I hope that he will be able to say a little more about what paragraph (	<i>b</i>)(ii) means. I am not quite sure what it means. Perhaps the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins), whose Bill this is, knows what is meant by the words
	<br><q><p>"that the assets of the body are applied only for the purposes of objects of the body"</p></q>
that is fair enough—
	<br><q><p>"which do not include the making over of assets to any member of the body except for value".</p></q>
Does that mean except in terms of a normal straight commercial transaction? Is that is what it means it sounds a very reasonable provision, but if it means something more subtle which is immediately obvious only to those who have spent some time studying company law, I shall be grateful if the Minister, who has obviously had to study some company law since he arrived in the Department, will explain it to us. We ought to know what we are legislating about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also why is there the distinction between who will certify what is a common-owned firm and what is a co-operative enterprise? The Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies will certify the one. The Secretary of State will certify the other. Why do they have to be certified by different people? Why does this arise? Could it therefore arise, as different people are doing the job, that they will use somewhat different criteria in making their decisions? I should have hoped that we could let one person rather than two decide how a body came to qualify potentially for benefit under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little concerned also about the drafting in subsection (4) of the new clause. I am not against what it means, but I am worried about what it might mean. The words are:
	<br><q><p>"If it appears to the registrar or the Secretary of State that a body in respect of which he has given a certificate in pursuance of this section has ceased to be a common ownership enterprise…".</p></q>
Is that sufficiently tightly drawn to make sure that the Secretary of State cannot revoke a certificate given by the registrar, and vice versa? I am not sure that it is.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
Perhaps a little tightening of the grammar would make it plain. What I am sure of is the intent, that the Secretary of State may revoke his certificates but not the registrar's, and vice versa. That may be unduly pedantic, but we have a duty when legislating to make sure that it is clear as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members on the Government side who have tabled amendments will wish to explain why they have done so. At this stage, I wish only to refer to amendments in the names of my hon. Friends and myself. I shall not argue for Amendment (g) at any length at present, because I have raised the general quetion of the difference between the registrar certifying some societies and the Secretary of State others, and Amendment (g) refers to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (e) to line 14 of the new clause refers to something which, I think, will be slightly contentious between us—the question whether the rights of all members of these societies should be equal. In general, as I said at our first sitting, I think that in most cases they should be. But we also have to take care in drafting the Bill that we do not do so in such a way as to slow down the transition to common-owned firms or the creation of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be many occasions when people who have built up a firm and devoted their lives to it will be hesitating between whether to make the firm over to employees or treat it in a more conventional manner. One of the factors which will influence them profoundly will be their concern that the take-over be smooth and successful, that the customers of the firm will have confidence in the firm continuing under new ownership, and that that confidence will be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it may be that at an interim stage such an owner handing over control would want to balance it perhaps by giving to some of the more senior staff heavier voting rights—weighted voted rights—than the others. He might want to do it by length of service, by the grade of job concerned or some other means, and I do not think that it is for us to rule too tightly on the way he shall do it. If the Minister is supposing that a person could be excluded from membership by reason of any "other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
factor", he is, in contrast to that rather broad brush technique, being a little tight on this question of the voting rights having to be equal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that a firm depends so much on a few key people that it would be the general feeling that it was not improper for them to have heavier voting rights. It may be that there is a compromise on which we ought to legislate to limit the degree of inequality. I am a little dubious about it, because I think that essentially it is a matter for the employers. But I do not think that we should legislate in a way which would inhibit the growth of the movement, if we can avoid it. I hope that both the Minister and the promoter of the Bill will be able to respond on the points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some questions to ask supplementary to those asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit). First, can the Minister give a little more detail about the result of the research that he has done on the burden that might be put on the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies as regards the time scale, the number he envisages, and what happens on the Continent—in France in particular—where common and co-operative ownership is a good deal further developed than it is in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question relates to the eligibility of employees only for membership. Perhaps the Minister will tell the Commitee what happened at Meriden, for instance, when the Transport and General Workers' Union took a large part in the reorganisation. Does it happen that union officials become members for the time being, or do they retain entirely an advisory capacity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, reference has been made to the "odd-balls" that sometimes set up common ownership schemes. The early history of America embraced the Bible Communist Society of John Humphrey Noyes which insisted on group sex, and Shakerism which denied all sex. It may be that there are still strange bodies which wish to set up common ownership schemes with extraordinary provisions, and perhaps the Minister will tell the Committee how he proposes to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
With regard to equality of treatment, I believe that there are a number of occasions on which this may not be helpful to the enterprise. Perhaps there is a special talent—that of an inventor. Perhaps there are special facilities—for example, a farmer who hands over his farm. Perhaps there is a rescue operation to be undertaken and the person or persons coming in demand that, until the enterprise is put back on a sound footing, they must have a greater say. There is the position that arises if the owner wishes to hand over his business and, as in the case of Landsman, there are A and B shares with certain differences in the rights accorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister and the promoter could cover those points, I should be most grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer to the point which the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) raised about what is a co-operative society? We must realise that co-operation takes many forms. When we talk about the Co-operative movement in this country now, we tend to think about the co-operative consumer society which is owned by the consumer members of the society. There are about 11 million members of co-operative societies throughout Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are dealing with in the Bill when we refer to common ownership and co-operative organisations, is the cooperative producer organisation. Such co-operatives are factories and organisations owned and controlled by their workers. Quite specifically, new Clause 2(2)(	<i>b</i>) states:
	<br><q><p>"the body is controlled by a majority of the people working for the body and of the people working for the subsidiaries, if any, of the body."</p></q>
There need be no confusion. The definition is clear. There are consumer co-operatives, producer co-operatives, agricultural co-operatives and credit cooperatives. They take many forms. But in the Bill we are confining ourselves, when we speak of co-operatives, to workers' co-operatives and producer co-operatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Co-operative movement was founded in this country by Robert Owen, it has now spread throughout the world. International Co-operative Alliance has co-operative organisations in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
America, the East, the West—all over the world. African countries are represented as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are producer co-operatives in many countries. In France, workers' cooperatives have developed to a large extent. We are concerned in the Bill not with the consumer co-operative movement or other forms of co-operative organisation but specifically with the workers' co-operative, and it is well defined in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might intervene at this stage, though not necessarily to answer in detail the various points that have been made, for I know that my hon. Friend the Minister will want to deal with some of them. However, I shall make some reference to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) rightly said that there might be some difficulty in taking amendments with the new clause, but I think he realised, thinking on his feet as he went on, that the new clauses are grouped together with the selected amendments so that we may refer to the amendments, and they can be voted upon or otherwise when we come to the end of the debate. Indeed, we can have a wide-ranging debate, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman realised, thinking on his feet, as I say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is kind of the hon. Gentleman to suggest that I am bright enough to think on my feet. The point is that I had not thought it through in quite the same way as he had. Whatever we do in terms of debate, of course, we have to vote to insert the new clause before we can vote to amend it. Normally, we should have a clause there, and vote on the amendments before voting on the substantive Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that clarifies the position still further. I understand the hon. Gentleman's joke—and I recognise that a joke for him is no laughing matter—but I think that he has demonstrated a considerable capacity to think on his feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Bulmer) raised the question of Meriden and various other places, and my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) has provided a partial reply to those questions. The overall
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
position is that, on the question of conversion, which, basically is what we are talking about in the Bill, each organisation can make its own transitory arrangements. This also came up in the questions raised by the hon. Member for Chingford, and I am certainly not aware that anything in the Bill precludes that. Neither am I aware—though I state this with some caution—that there is anything to preclude—or, indeed, include—group sex or any other fringe benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They might be taxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says they might be taxed, which is an interesting thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Minister when, in moving the new clause, he said that he hoped that I and my co-sponsors would find the new clause broadly acceptable. I assure him that I find it broadly acceptable, because it is a redrafting and general tightening-up of the original Clause 1. There is an important point here regarding the limits to be placed on the Chief Registrar, and I accept those limits, for I realise, on reflection, that it is not appropriate that the registrar, who is, after all, in a Civil Service type of position, should have to take value judgments. They ought to be taken by the Secretary of State, who is answerable directly to Parliament. I certainly accept that, and I appreciate the detailed analysis which has been made, with all the Government's resources behind it, to bring about the redrafting. I confirm that I have been consulted over this, and I am broadly happy to accept the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to the two amendments standing in my name and those of my hon. Friends. Amendment (a) is by no means unrelated to some of the remarks of the hon. Member for Chingford regarding co-operatives, because it proposes to omit the word "society" at line 5 of the new clause and insert the word "enterprise". This is intended as a probing amendment to seek clarification of the use of the word "society" in my hon. Friend's proposed new clause. Throughout the Bill we speak of "enterprises" specifically, and refer always to common ownership enterprises, and I am worried as to whether the word "society" might
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
have a special legal connotation. I am slightly worried also about whether it might refer specifically to organisations such as the London Co-operative Society or, as in my constituency, the North-Eastern Co-operative Society, which are well established and consumer co-operatives in the retail trade. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare, with his vast experience, has gone some way towards clearing that up, but, above all, I want a clear explanation as to whether that kind of restriction would apply, because I am anxious not to restrict the meaning of the clause specifically to established co-operatives of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to Amendment (d) to the new clause—
	<br><q><p>"that the body is controlled by a majority of the people working for the body and of the people working for the subsidiaries, if any, of the body."</p></q>
It is a fundamental feature of common ownership that an enterprise is controlled democratically by a majority of its members and that the members constitute a substantial majority of those working for the enterprise. I make the important point, which is not unrelated to what has already been said in the Committee, that this is in no way a negation of efficient management. I know that one can conjure up a picture of an entire works sitting down and having a kind of super-committee meeting to discuss some necessary management decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hasten to assure the Committee that my proposal does not envisage any such situation. I submit, in the light of existing common ownerships where this has applied, that there has been no negation of efficient management. On the contrary, it concentrates the mind of managements to know that they have a responsibility to the managed as well as to the customers of their enterprise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The machinery to ensure that the management is conducted efficiently while at the same time being responsible to the overall body can and does vary in existing common ownerships. It is obvious that, where there are six people working together, it is not difficult toe have a full and efficient consultation and decision-making. Even if six members of our Committee were formed together into a common ownership enterprise, notwithstanding our predilection to talk at great length, if we were involved in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
common objectives and working together, we could quickly reach a management decision. Where there are more people involved, of course, there is a different situation, so different arrangements apply, as they do in the number of common ownership enterprises already in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting in this context to refer to the John Lewis Partnership. I am aware that that partnership is not a common ownership as defined in the Bill, but, as I said on Second Reading, it is an important example of democratic responsibility of management towards the overall body in a large organisation, consisting of some 25,000 members and with a complex machinery to control the management, which is accepted as being very efficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The set-up in the John Lewis Partnership is that the chairman has very great executive power, but at the same time he may be removed from office by the elected central council. I am mentioning these matters because I want to make clear that, although I am proposing in my amendment to the new clause something fundamental to thinking on common ownership, is not something which negates efficient management, since within each individual enterprise steps will obviously be taken to ensure that efficient management and democratic control can operate side by side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should say that without provision specifically to ensure that the responsibility is to a substantial majority and that control is by a substantial majority, it is possible that a minority could exercise control contrary to the interests of the majority. That would be a negation of the whole basis of the Bill. Amendment (	<i>d</i>) to New Clause 2 would eliminate that possibility, and I hope that it is acceptable to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Les Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admit to being a tiny bit confused, Mr. Jones, because I had hoped that we should have rather more identifiably separate debates on these amendments, and, although I do not in any way question your Chairmanship or guidance, it appears that we are now involved in a debate on the new clause and all the amendments. Is it your wish that we should lump them
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
together? I can deal with them together, but perhaps it would be more convenient for the Committee to have separate debates on the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we shall come to the separate debates on the amendments, but we must first get the clause read a Second time. The debate can, however, be wide in the context of the terms of the new clause and the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think you will agree, Mr. Jones, from the amount of paper work that has been passed back and forth, that the debate has already been widespread.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Though quite in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that, and I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Jones. I shall do my best to help hon. Gentlemen and my hon. Friends who raised some very important points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that this is a broad definition clause, and it is right that most of the points raised on both sides of the Committee strike at the heart of some of the important principles that we are discussing. That is why I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I talk at some length, because I want to go into detail on some of the matters raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) raised some constructive points. He asked whether the London Co-operative Society would qualify as a bona fide co-operative enterprise for a registration under the Bill. If the Conservative Party thought that the Government were about to bring in a Bill which would help in no small way the London Co-operative Society and co-operative societies throughout the country, it would be taking a different attitude to the Bill. In our profession of politics, I should not blame it for that. May I, therefore, reassure the Opposition, as my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) has already copiously assured them, that we are referring to workers' co-operatives and not consumer co-operatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I absolutely and specifically reassure hon. Gentlemen that new Clause 2(1)(	<i>b</i>)(i) excludes consumer co-operative enterprises such as the London Cooperative Society from the definition of a common ownership enterprise, since the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
definition in the new clause is that membership is restricted to employees. Similarly, new Clause 2(2)(	<i>b</i>) excludes consumer co-operatives such as the London Co-operative Society from the Bill's definition of a co-operative enterprise, the definition again being restricted to employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman is not reassured by me, perhaps he will be reassured by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare, who has had a great deal more practical experience than I have. I have a "co-op" number. My parents have a co-op number. But, as the hon. Gentleman says, we have all had to do a certain amount of reading of company law, and I accept the research with which I have been presented this morning as well as the detailed practical knowledge of my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stanley Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that at this point I ought to declare an interest as I happen to be a director of the London Co-operative Society which has been mentioned so freely this morning. I take it as absolute that there is no question whatsoever that the clause refers to societies such as the London Co-operative Society. If that were not the case, and if my hon. Friend said anything which detracted from that, the Committee would be facing a completely different situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) raised this matter earlier, I am sure that what my hon. Friend the Minister has said in this respect must be accepted by the Committee, or the situation would be very different from that which I believe we are facing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only say "Now we have had it from the management and the workers ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should say that I referred so freely to the London Cooperative Society because I am a Londoner rather than because, as the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) knows, I am aware that he is a director of the London Co-operative Society. I was not trying to pull his leg about this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I am completely satisfied by the Minister's assurance. I hope that he will now say a little more about the philosophy behind the clause and the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
creation in legislative terms of two animals—common-owned enterprises and co-operative enterprises—between which there is a slight difference of treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do, indeed, intend to say something about that, but I still want to help the hon. Gentleman by answering some of his questions. I take on board what he has said. He mentioned earlier the possibility of exclusions, and referred particularly to the possibility of exclusions being made which flew in the face of other legislation. He referred to subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>)(i), and on that especially I assure the hon. Gentleman that the provisions of this new clause would not allow such a body to make rules which would otherwise be contrary to other legislation such as the Race Relations Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. I recognise that there is provision for exclusion in that subsection but, according to my guidance on these matters, there is certainly no meaning or intention there to enable anyone to fly in the face of the legislation to which he has referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman went on to talk about equality among members and what type of equality they may have, and he referred to his Amendment (e). The Government feel that if such an amendment were carried—I hope we shall have time to talk about it in more detail later—it would fly very much in the face of the purposes of the Bill. It is most important that all members should have an equal opportunity to participate in the running of the enterprise if they so wish, and that all employees should be eligible for membership. If we introduced anything contrary to that, it would fly in the face of the spirit of the Bill and the spirit of many of the enterprises which we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivor Clemitson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of equality, is it not true that subsection (1) (	<i>b</i>)(i) specifically provides for the question of length of service being dealt with, so that, although those who are members would, of course, have equal voting rights, people may well have to have served a certain length of time in employment with the enterprise before they have any voting rights? Does that not deal with one of the points raised by the hon. Member for Chingford?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0337">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend, with his experience, because he is absolutely right. There may well be such provision for graduation to membership, and I hope that we shall be able to discuss that later on in the Bill. But I am grateful to my hon. Friend for having once again brought some useful and practical advice to bear on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to become involved in cross-talk which is unduly complicated, but I did notice that provision—age, length of service or other factors of any description—and in fact it relates to persons becoming members. It does not relate to their voting rights when they are members, and these are two slightly different points. I agree that part of the point is answered, but not the whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One again, I hope that we can discuss in a little more detail this whole concept of equality when we debate the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn next to the question whether it ought to be the Secretary of State or the registrar who issues the certificates. That is a more complicated matter, but basically what it comes down to is that we do not feel that we ought to impose an undue burden on the registrar. He has already had a fair amount of work to do, and no doubt hon. Gentlemen opposite would not wish to increase the registrar's staff to carry out these functions. Moreover, apart from that, because value judgments are involved, we believe that it is far more appropriate that the Secretary of State rather than the registrar should make value judgments. Nevertheless, I hope that we shall have a chance to discuss that in more detail on the appropriate amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister suggesting that the Secretary of State has staff with time on their hands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman reads his newspaper, as I am sure he does, he will be aware that all sections of Government Departments are under pressure to keep down the numbers of their staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chingford referred to the revocation of certificates under subsection (4) of new Clause 2. I am assured that the power to revoke a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
certificate can be exercised only in relation to one issued by the person revoking it. Thus, for example, if the Secretary of State is concerned, I am assured that he could not revoke a certificate issued by the Chief Registrar; nor could the Chief Registrar revoke a certificate issued by the Secretary of State. I hope that that guides the hon. Gentleman a little further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then went into what could, I suppose, on the face of things, appear to be a complex matter—the use of the term "value" in paragraph (	<i>b</i>)(ii). I am assured that if we do not have something like this provision in the new clause, co-operative enterprises will not be able to pay wages. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I personally consider that to be a good reason for putting in this provision. May I also assure him that in subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>)(ii) the words "for value" have the normal commercial connotation which he suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To go a little further, since the hon. Gentleman has raised a rather important point and I know that anyone going through the Bill might wonder why these words have been included, I assure him and the Committee generally that subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>)(ii) and (iii) provide for the rules of a common ownership enterprise to be framed to preclude distribution of the assets among members at any time, save for two exceptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These two exceptions are the use of assets to pay wages to employees who are also members of the body, and the sharing of profits among members in so far as that is provided for in the rules. If that had not been included, there would be difficulty in paying wages and sharing profits. Indeed, since it is one of the aims of the establishment of common enterprises, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will see that we had to include something like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member goes on to say that some of the membership and exclusion provisions are drawn too tightly, I can only refer him to what I have already said about the need for equality in voting rights and to what my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Clemitson) said about some kind of probationary membership. That is a matter which we shall discuss later. Having had a great deal to do with the setting up of a co-operative at Meriden,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
I can assure the hon. Member that the concept of equality of membership in voting rights is very important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point put by the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit). In certain circumstances, I can well understand the position arising where the owner of an enterprise, wishing to passing it over to some form of workers' control, would wish to impose certain conditions to keep the enterprise in existence. The Bill provides for a purely voluntary arrangement, and there would be alternatives available if he did not wish to enter into common ownership as here defined. It would be folly to modify the Bill in order to accommodate such a situation when alternatives are available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am very grateful for my hon. Friend's practical experience and detailed research. I should now like to move on to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves that point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was just coming to some of the points the hon. Gentleman raised earlier. If he will first give me a chance to deal with those, I shall then deal with the points which he now seeks to raise, if that is convenient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely a matter for the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Jones, I am, as always, trying to be as helpful as I possibly can to all members of the Committee, whichever side they may sit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following the speech made by his hon. Friend, I wonder whether the Minister could address himself to the reassurance I seek, that this definition would not have the effect of precluding existing common ownership firms, because the Landsman firm has the shares to which I referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My advice is that we do not intend to exclude along the lines mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, but since he has cited a particular example of a common ownership enterprise I shall look into it and let him have full information on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman spoke earlier, he pointed out that co-operatives
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
had gone further in certain countries than they have here. One reason is that in France and other countries the legal structures are different. Apart from the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts of 1965 to 1975 and the Companies Act 1948, we have not had a major revision of company law. There may be one in the offing. At this stage, I do not wish to predict the content of the next Queen's Speech in any way. Perhaps it is a subject to which a future Session of the House of Commons could turn. However, I advise the hon. Gentleman that the legal situation in France and other countries is rather more advanced and in some ways more beneficial to the establishment of such enterprises than it is here at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And in Spain, but the hon. Gentleman knows that I will not be sidetracked into a discussion of cooperatives or anything else in Spain this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chingford spoke about Meriden and the official position of officials of the Transport and General Workers' Union—in which I, as a sponsored Member and one of the original members of the Meriden Cooperative, should declare an interest. The hon. Gentleman probably knows that the Meriden hierarchy, or management set-up, consists of trustees, an advisory board, and then a wider membership. It may well be that officials of the TGWU could be trustees and one of the share-holders. Certainly, there is no provision for its exclusion. The Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative, as it is more properly known, is in fact a registered company called Synova Motors, with three trustee shareholders. There would certainly be no provision for the exclusion of Transport and General Workers' Union officials as trustees. On the other hand, it might be possible for officials to be members of the advisory board. However, the bulk of the advisory board at Meriden consists of shop stewards of the main unions in the plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the set-up at Meriden is rather different from the type of situation we are discussing. Being a trustee or a member of the advisory board does
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
not necessarily imply full membership of the co-operative. Full membership and voting rights in the co-operative belong to the men who work on the shop floor and who are full members of the co-operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to say mush about the benefits of group sex this morning, though the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Bulmer) was right to raise the matter of fringe benefits because such benefits are conferred by certain cooperatives. I am sure that this morning nothing is further from the mind of my hon. Friend the promoter of the Bill and others of my hon. Friends, although such matters are appropriate for consideration and vote, and we ought to allow a little devolution of power to the co-operative enterprises themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member talked of the exclusion or special position of skilled men. In enterprises such as Meriden there is a distinction between employees of the cooperative. For instance, Merident has a skilled management team which may not necessarily have full voting rights in the co-operative. When talking of certain skills, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not forget that the contracting of certain skills and specialist technologies is not precluded by the membership and structure of co-operatives such as Meriden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) raised some valuable points, and I should like to discuss them when we come to them in debate. I assure him that the term "bona fide cooperative society" that currently stands in new Clause 2 is an established and familiar concept. The registrar knows what it means, and I am assured that most people who have to deal with it know what it means. I hope that that assurance will comfort my hon. Friend, although I hope also that we shall be able to discuss these matters in the detailed discussion on amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his Amendment (d) my hon. Friend raises an important principle in all common ownership enterprises—that they ought to be controlled by a majority of the people working in them. He is well aware, as I am, of the dangers of common ownership enterprises falling under the control of minority interests instead of majority interests. I hope we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
shall be able to discuss that important matter in more detail when we come to his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like now to wind up. Hon. Members have raised some important points. This is a basic definition clause. In many people's eyes, I suppose that "co-ops" means people occupying factories and that to others it represents the Co-operative Wholesale Society or the retail co-operative societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking particularly of either of those. I am talking about the number of smaller co-operatives, common ownership enterprises and workers' cooperatives, that now exist up and down the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Consett knows a large number of examples, as do other of my hon. Friends. It is this spirit that we seek to encourage. It is the spirit behind the industrial common ownership movement we want to encourage and it is in that direction that we want to channel the energies and the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, and apologising once more for taking up a lot of time, I hope that my hon. Friend and hon. Gentlemen opposite will feel able to accept the broad definitional strategy in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still find some difficulty in understanding why a distinction is drawn between the two sorts of organisation in the way that it has been drawn. Of course we do not want to give too much work to the Registrar of Friendly Societies and we accept the Minister's comments, but I am still not happy that there should be two sorts of animals dealt with in two different ways. The Minister did not cover that point, to my satisfaction at any rate. Perhaps the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) will address himself to that point, as perhaps it is one of philosophy to some extent rather than technical legislation. Perhaps we could let the Minister off the hook for a while and allow the sponsor of the Bill to have a go at the Minister's version of his Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to one other point without unnecessarily delaying the proceedings. In your wisdom, Mr. Jones, you decided not to select Amendment (f), presumably on the ground that it was almost a wrecking amendment. I am sorry about that, although we are in no position, nor would we want to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
dispute that ruling. However, as we are on the Second Reading of the new clause, for once it is convenient to do things the other way round and I should like therefore to refer to the matter of that amendment in that context, that is, concerning the use of the assets on the winding-up of the firm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for accepting that, if a firm is to be wound up, those who have given it service for a long period of years—perhaps have taken wages lower than they otherwise would have done, perhaps have worked hours that they otherwise would not have done, and worked with a spirit that they otherwise would not have had—should be entitled to the assets which they have helped to build up. Provided the firm is profitable and is not being wound up because of financial problems, I suppose that they could increase dividends or wages to themselves, provided that the law did not prohibit it, to such an extent that the assets were used up. Presumably there would be nothing to stop them doing that. But if they were to do that in a straightforward way and say "We have come to the conclusion that it is time to wind up the firm", the firm's activity perhaps no longer being in demand, what would be more reasonable than that the employers should take the assets? Why should someone else inherit the assets? It is in fact a discouragement to the building-up of assets in a firm to say that those who build them up will be unable to benefit from them if the firm is dissolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think, therefore, that the Minister should give further consideration to this matter. Perhaps the hon. Member for Consett should do so, although I know that he, too, felt that this provision should be included—it was in his original Bill—but I do not. I think that there is a case for letting members take the assets. I appreciate that there is the possibility, unless one is very careful in drafting this legislation, of a neat and tidy transfer of assets between owners of a firm and others. Of course there is a possibility of loopholes. I referred to that on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, it is important that the members of a common owned firm should not be in this way different from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
owners of a conventional firm. If those who have set up a business with money, who have employed other people in a business the assets of which have increased during the years, have the right as they undoubtedly do to wind up the firm, to pay off the men and to retain the assets, why should not the owners of a common owned firm, who are also the employees and therefore have a double right, have a right to retain the assets which they have built up?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an element of somewhat fusty nineteenth-century do-good Socialism about this provision. There is a somewhat anti-wealth creation feel about it—if not that, strangely enough, an anti-wealth distribution to those who have created it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we could have all agreed today that those who work in a common owned firm have a double entitlement to the fruits of their labour, both as the labourers and as the providers of capital. I hope that I can persuade the Minister and hon. Members opposite that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to keep going back over the same points because I think that the Minister's mind is to some extent closed on these matters, but I must return again to the question of equal voting rights and to the exclusion of members or would-be members from membership of the firm by reason of
	<br><q><p>"other factors of any description".</p></q>
The Minister was kind enough to say that he had been advised that that provision would not allow discrimination which would otherwise be unlawful. But, or course, he was not able to say that it precluded what would be, at present, lawful discrimination—on the grounds of politics, for example, or habits, or colour of eyes, and so on. The provision could be applied in very arbitrary fashion and there would be no appeal against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely a definition as wide as
	<br><q><p>"other factors of any description"</p></q>
cannot be left without providing a form of appeal for a person who feels that he has been arbitrarily misused. It could be used to say that only members of the T & GWU were eligible as opposed to members of ASTMS. I fear to imagine the row that would be caused, but it would be legitimate if we passed this provision as it stands. I appeal to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0341">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
Minister therefore to reconsider the phrase
	<br><q><p>"other factors of any description".</p></q>
We are bound in this place by precedent, but it may not be the best precedent to put that form of words into the law. I do not know whether it has ever been used before. I doubt it. But it may be in future Ministers will say, "What an extraordinarily good precedent. No other descriptions at all, one can exclude people from a particular privilege by other factors of any description." We should not legislate in that way, and, when we contrast that with the Minister's insistence that all people must be equal in terms of voting rights, it seems odd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can exclude from membership on any grounds one likes, but one cannot differentiate amongst members as to their voting rights on any grounds whatsoever. Those two things do not hang together. I accept what the Minister said about Meriden, but it may well be that equal votes were vital in that case. But that was only one case, and there may be many other cases where it is not necessarily so, and where, in future, the reverse may be true. I should like the Committee to realise how strongly many of my hon. Friends and I feel on those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a number of important points, and I realise that there are deep feelings particularly about the matter of disposal of the assets upon the winding-up of a company. The hon. Gentleman made his position and that of his hon. Friends clear on this point on Second Reading, and I know he appreciates that we feel very strongly in a different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in his saying that the hon. Gentleman would regard this as a kind of destruction of wealth by people not being able to sell off the assets and have the cash divided amongst themselves. I would have taken an opposite view, that where there was a viable concern producing something, and those assets—the machinery and plant—were continuing to produce something for which there was a profitable market, the reverse would be the case and that by selling up then and translating into cash one would be discontinuing the production of wealth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
I recognise that there are differences between us on this point, but where there is a viable organisation producing something which people are buying, it seems wrong that people should simply be able to close it down in order to pocket the cash rather than that those assets should go on producing wealth. I know that a different situation arises when the organisation has become not viable, because nobody wants to buy any longer what it produces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not too much in disagreement with the hon. Gentleman, but let me put it in this way to him. First, when a business is sold, it does not necessarily cease to create wealth simply because it has acquired new owners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, if the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends formed a worker-owned enterprise to manufacture a particular commodity and, after a while, decided that such was the level of taxation that they would like to sell and go abroad to a happier clime, such as the United States or Poland, they would not be destroying the wealth they had built up if they decided to sell it to another common-owned enterprise run by my hon. Friends and myself, who having greater tenacity in resisting high taxation and other such problems, decided that we would stay and make a go of it. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman would be right to want to do so, as it would enable him to re-employ in a new enterprise the assets created by him. He might want to emigrate to Scotland, if it were independent, and have a try there. He would not be destroying the wealth, and if he did not have the knowledge to do that, he might be discouraged from ploughing back his earnings into the firm, thereby making it a better firm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are probably not as far apart as would appear to be the case. I have stated the position as my co-sponsors and I feel it to be. It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman mentioned the possibility of transferring to a common ownership enterprise in America or Poland. In the United States there is a substantial growth of self-management—which I gather is the American term for common ownership. Even Poland has its problems and it has a quite different type of economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
Briefly, on the other important matter raised by the hon. Gentleman on the difference between the common ownerships and co-operatives, I accept that there is a difficulty. We are dealing with two different versions of the same basic concept, and are seeking, broadly, to define common ownership within the framework of existing company law. We have already pointed out some of the difficulties that have inevitably arisen and the need for revision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that part of the problem has arisen as regards the different references in the Bill, because one exists and is legislated for—that is, the co-operative organisation—whereas the other exists and is not specifically legislated for and we are trying to legislate for it. We have what appears on the surface to be two different descriptions, two different shades of meaning, of something which is basically the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the permission and indulgence of the Committee, I may again have to speak at length, because what we intend to do with new Clause 1 is to replace the old Clauses 4, 5 and 6, and, as the Committee knows, those clauses included some pretty important parts of the meat of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 1 deals with the provisions for financial assistance by way of grants
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
and loans which the Government are prepared to make available. The relevant Money Resolution was approved by Parliament in the rather early hours of 22nd June. The effect of the new clause is to enable the Secretary of State to make grants, subject to Treasury consent, of up to £30,000 a year for five years to an approved body providing an advisory service about the organisation of common ownership enterprises and cooperative enterprises. That is what subsection (1) is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To qualify for grants, the body must appear to the Secretary of State to be constituted for the purposes of encouraging the development of common ownership enterprises and co-operative enterprises and to include among its members one or more representatives of trade unions. The trade unions' position is detailed in subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will also be empowered by this new clause, subject again to Treasury consent, to make grants or loans of up to £50,000 a year
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>51</span>
for five years to the body for the purposes of assisting the body to make loans to common ownership enterprises and co-operative enterprises. That is what Subsection (2) is about. The clause does not provide for the body to make grants to the enterprises. I stress that because the Opposition may feel it to be rather important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may regulate by statutory instrument, subject to the approval of Parliament under the negative resolution procedure, the conditions governing the on-lending of this money by the body. The regulations would cover the circumstances in which such loans could be made, the purposes for which the money may be lent and the terms on which it may also be lent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Broadly, that is what new Clause 1 is intended to do. I recognise that it is a fairly comprehensive provision and that the Opposition, as well as some of my hon. Friends, may wish to raise important points of principle. I should prefer to deal with those as they arise rather than go through them initially in great depth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This new clause, like new Clause 2, is a replacement or substitution clause which we wish to insert into the Bill because it is the product of more detailed research and analysis into what my hon. Friend the promoter seeks to do. Because I hope that what we seek to do is broadly in line with his objectives, and because it broadly commends itself to him and his hon. Friends, I hope that it will commend itself to the whole Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This we regard as a rather difficult clause. I shall not go into the detail of the amendments which my hon. Friends and I have put down, but I shall address myself to the general matter of the clause itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great need to contain public expenditure at present. Indeed, there can never be a time when the containment of public expenditure is not an important matter. I hope that the Government will not think I am being provocative when I say that the Prime Minister's remarks recently would lead many hon. Members to the belief that he may be contemplating some moves in that direction. I shall not deal with whether that is greeted with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
delight or with gloom—that varies according to where one sits and sees the world—but we know that there is a continuing squeeze on public expenditure by any standards at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we have to consider most carefully any measure which would increase public expenditure by however small an amount. Among my hon. Friends public expenditure is always wrong in principle, but once they get down to the particular case in their constituencies they may have a slightly different attitude towards it in particular. This is a human failing which we all have, and, no matter how hard we try to restrain ourselves, some of us are more able to restrain ourselves than others. But there is always that temptation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As members of this Committee know, I am far from ill-disposed towards common-owned firms, but I can restrain my enthusiasm for them to some extent when we reach the matter of giving out public money on non-commercial terms by way of loan or completely giving it by way of grant, not because I think that there should be no assistance for them whatsoever but because I think that the assistance given to them should be on the same terms as that which is given to any other form of enterprise. In other words we should hesitate before committing ourselves to public expenditure by or through bodies which use criteria different from those governing expenditure for similar purposes through other channels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister well knows that money provided under Section 8 of the Industry Act is money upon which the Secretary of State receives advice from the Industrial Development Advisory Board. It has its guidelines and criteria which it takes into consideration before recommending that money should be made available under Section 8 of the Industry Act. Moneys made available under the general heading of regional aid have to be considered very carefully, and the criteria are laid down. There are criteria for moneys which it is intended should be made available through the National Enterprise Board, although they are referred to as guidelines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the guidelines or criteria which will be in use for money made available under this proposed clause? Will they be different? The Minister of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

State at the Department of Industry has once or twice been heard to go overboard for the concept of profits. I have heard him wax lyrical on the virtues of profits. He explained at great length that the Government are intent on investing money to achieve profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the public money which it is proposed be invested under this clause to be invested with that same background philosophy behind it, that it is for profitable firms, that the money will go where the profits are good? Will there be a hard-nosed attitude, with the Minister of State perhaps taking a correspondence course from Arnold Weinstock before he actually signs the cheques? Or is there a different attitude?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we do not having anything written into the Bill, and if the Secretary of State is to make money available on such terms as he thinks fit, we ought to have some idea of what he will be looking for. Is the mere fact that a business is owned in common by its employees sufficient, or is probable profitability to be one of the criteria that he will expect to be used, either by himself or by the body or bodies which are set up to assist him in distributing moneys?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be two companies in competition with each other—one conventionally owned, the other owned in common—employing similar chaps whose wives shop in the same supermarkets and who themselves drink in the same pub. It would not be right if one of those firms received aid on a totally different basis from the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us want to encourage the development of this type of firm, but we want to encourage it not only because we think that it is socially beneficial—or any of those other subjective terms—but because we think that such firms are economically more efficient than some of their competitors, or at least we want to give them the chance to show that they are. We should not discriminate against one sort of business or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is our objection to the main part of the thinking behind the new clause. I shall come back later to the matters with which we deal more particularly in the amendments. Some of them are merely to reduce the amounts of money available, and to turn away from grants and loans towards loans only and solely on commercial terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>54</span>
The most important is Amendment (f) which, because it relates to a non-financial matter, I should prefer to deal with separately. It relates to knocking off from the end of the clause what appears to be a somewhat odd bit that was tacked on in the first place and which does not fit in with the rest of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister and the promoter of the Bill will be able to respond to some of the matters I have raised, even if not to agree with me on the general philosophy that I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we shall accept the new clause as it stands and resist the amendments. It is true, as the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) said, that we are particularly concerned about public expenditure, but what is involved in the Bill is a small amount of public expenditure compared with the thousands of millions of pounds we deal with in the House of Commons from year to year. We are talking of £250,000 when, it has been said, private enterprise is receiving aid to the extent of £3 million a day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Look at what it is contributing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is it contributing? What can these new forms of organisation contribute if they are given the chance to succeed and are given the aid they need in the initial stages? We are concerned with public expenditure, and we are concerned with employment. These organisations can create new job opportunities, which is the part of the Government's policy, supported by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his deep knowledge of the Co-operative movement, can the hon. Gentleman say whether thought has been given to following the example of the co-operative movement in France—to take 0.3 per cent. of turnover and apply it to the setting up of co-operatives and to legal, financial and economic advice? That has proved a far more effective method than has Government support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we want to aid is the desire of workers to form their own common-owned organisations, and help get them off the ground. These are already in existence in this country a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>55</span>
number of workers-controlled organisations which take from their own profits and give to other groups of workers who want to set themselves up. What has been suggested may well be considered in the future. Once we have a large number of such organisations, as there are in France, a proportion of their profits could go towards helping other workers' organisations. I am sure that most organisations would be sympathetic to that idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking here about getting these organisations started. The Government are giving public funds for job creation, and here is a tremendous opportunity to creat job opportunities. I understand the Opposition's desire to curb public spending, but this is not public expenditure; it is national investment. We have the National Enterprise Board investing in one way, and here we have a do-it-yourself opportunity for people to create job opportunities for themselves. We should encourage that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the Floor of the House I referred to the example in my constituency where, because a firm had been taken over by a property concern, that firm collapsed. The workers wanted to take the enterprise over themselves. There was a full order book, and good industrial relations. It was a great opportunity. The management were with the men, but because they were part of a property concern the whole firm collapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, another enterprise moved in and it is working today under private enterprise conditions. However, I believe that there should have been the opportunity for those workers to run their own affairs, and this Bill will give that alternative to working people. I hope, therefore, that the Committee supports new Clause 1 as it stands and that the amendments will be resisted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clemitson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hate quoting speeches back at people because that is unfair, but the general drift of the speech of the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit), when he briefly referred to the financial provisions, was that although he was generally opposed to an increase in public expenditure, he felt that it was better to spend money in this way than, say, employing men to pick up stones from a beach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
On the question of advisers, the hon. Gentleman said that he was not sure there was a shortage of Government advisers. In fact, new Clause 1 proposes that grants should be made available to a body so that that body itself can appoint advisers, consultants, or whatever. I should have thought that went a long way to meet objections of the kind which the hon. Member for Chingford raised on Second Reading. I find it a little odd that he now proposes that subsection (1) be deleted from the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are talking about public expenditure, this may be a convenient moment to put a point to the Minister. I feel that this help is either too little or too much. The help would be better given by means of a concession in the Finance Bill, in the initial stages, but that is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their enthusiasm for this proposal, have the Minister and his colleagues in the Government considered trying the odd experiment in little bits of common ownership within a nationalised industry? I suggest—I suggest it very seriously—the coal mining industry. A lot of British syndicalism in the last century sprang out of our coal mines. Might not the Government give a better stimulus to these endeavours if, within the very large public sector, they were to take a coal mine—I say a coal mine, but I bow to any hon. Member who suggests another activity, but that seemed a natural choice because of the strong syndicalist tendencies there in the last century—and try it as a common ownership experiment? I put that as a serious suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of advice that this new clause endeavours to finance deals with what seems to me by far the biggest problem in common ownership schemes, looked at historically, namely, what follows the first generation. As has been said, there are various motives for setting up these schemes. To ones that I have looked at, including those to which my hon. Friend the Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Bulmer) referred—the early experiments in America, particularly in New England; he might also have referred to the ones in Rhode Island, in the seventeenth century—always failed in the second or third generation. It is on that point particularly that those starting common ownership ventures will require help and advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0347">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
I say that merely to identify the problem. I do not attempt to answer it. I merely to say that, in my experience, there is one organisation which has run common ownership pretty successfully for the past 1,400 years, and it is run by those who have followed the rule of St. Benedict.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Price) put certain specific points to my hon. Friend the Minister who, I know, will deal with them, but may I say that the hon. Gentleman and I are very much at one in his comments on the coal industry. My ultimate ambition is to turn the nationalised industries over to common ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us try an experiment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. Manifestly, there is no feeling that they are in common ownership at present, although that was the original theory upon which their structure is based. I am very much at one with the hon. Gentleman on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I want to address myself to the new clause and to make clear, as the promoter of the Bill, that I accept the new clause. My hon. Friend the Minister made the important point, with which I agree, that the proposal is that the Government have no power to make grants to enterprises. They have power only to make grants in order to sustain what is repeatedly referred to as "the body", that is to say, the relevant body existing to help and assist the development of common ownership enterprises, the body which, in my view, would be charged with keeping a very strict eye on the loans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) rightly laid considerable stress on the granting of loans. My own view is that applications would have to be strictly examined, and people seeking loans would have to prove the probable viability of the project, though I accept that the viability of any project cannot be proved absolutely in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A certain amount of national publicity has been given to the Bill, and it may be of interest to the Committee that I have had a number of approaches from all sorts of individuals who appear to think that, because I am sponsoring the Bill, I am in a position to get them money for projects which struck me as highly unlikely ever to prove viable. So I am very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
much in sympathy with what the hon. Member for Chingford is saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Chingford said, there are a number of precedents. He referred to the Industrial Development Advisory Board, to the National Enterprise Board, and to the Industry Act which has now been in operation for a few years. A great body of experience has grown up in that respect. They seem to me to establish precedents which would be carried into the examination of applications by "the body", as it is called in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Bulmer) pointed out that in France it is normal for a percentage of profits of common ownership enterprises to be set aside for investment to assist common ownership in general. That happens in this country, too. Where common ownership concerns exist, they already do that. The normal articles of association lay down a percentage of the profit for investment in the enterprise itself for capital development and so on, and what is left over is divided as a bonus between the people employed in the enterprise and can be set aside for other purposes. It is a fact that a percentage of profits has been set aside. Indeed, the Industrial Common Ownership Movement has set up a body called Industrial Common Ownership Finance. Of course, it is non-statutory, but it exists nevertheless and has built up a body of experience in dealing with applications for loans, having very modest resources at its disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To turn to the general content of the new clause, I recognise that it reduces the financial provision which I and my cosponsors originally wrote into the Bill to substantially less than one-half. The Government indicated on Second Reading that the proposals in the Bill would not be acceptable within the constraints on public expenditure and that a Money Resolution, if and when made, would indicate a substantially smaller amount of money. That is what the Money Resolution approved by the House did, and its proposals are embodied in this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The overall object of the Bill is to increase productive industrial activity. That is at the very heart of the basic policy we must adopt in this country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) said, it is in line with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0348">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
Government's general basic policy, supported, as he said, by the Opposition, that our fundamental national need is to increase the overall national wealth, which can be done only through productive manufacturing industry. The financial proposals, modest as they are, in fact make a contribution towards that end. So I hope that the Committee will accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it will not be thought that I want to prolong the debate unduly. The hon. Member for Luton, East (Mr. Clemitson) was kind enough to refer to what I said on Second Reading. I certainly stand by what I said. If it is a choice between giving money to a local authority to invent jobs which are not real jobs in many cases, and making money available—I shall not say "giving money" merely because I do not approve of giving money—to men to create productive enterprises, I hope that the hon. Gentleman and I would be shoulder to shoulder in marching to Her Majesty's Government saying that we want to see the money go to create productive effort, particularly in an innovative way, rather than see it used for moving stones from one end of the beach to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading—this is col. 877 of 	<i>Hansard</i>—I emphasised when I intervened in the hon. Gentleman's speech that I hoped he would appreciate that we would want to be sure that any such provisions, regardless of public expenditure implications, did not leave one firm in an advantageous position in relation to access to capital and another of similar size in a not-so-advantageous position. That is a serious problem, and it was largely the burden of what I said earlier this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope also that it will be noticed that I specifically did not move to take away the power to lend money to common owned enterprises. I put down an amendment to govern the terms on which that money should be made available by loan, together with an amendment which I regard as being of a probing nature, to allow the Minister to justify the sums that are quoted in the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose in Amendment (a) to delete subsection (1), because we feel
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>60</span>
that this proposed body or bodies—it is not necessarily singular, it can be more than one—would be better financed from private funds. The view may be held that it is not easy to find £30,000 a year of untrammelled grant, which is the maximum that could be expended under subsection (1), but I suggest that there are more ways than one in which the money could be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, particularly when the Bill is enacted, it may be that the hon. Member from Consett (Mr. Watkins) will not merely receive letters from vaguely nutty people with vaguely nutty schemes. He might find, particularly with the assistance of perhaps one of the heavy Sunday newspapers, that schemes could be launched to raise money for this very purpose—the employment of advisers for the setting up of a body entirely independent of State grant. It would be the kind of body which would not have to be careful in case it got its grant stopped by the Minister. After all, there might not always be a Minister who was particularly well disposed towards the body; he might want it to do something and would cut off its money if it did not. That is one possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another novel way in which the money could be raised. For example, £30,000 a year is the gross interest payment on an investment of about £200,000 in the Treasury's new stock, and £200,000 in relation to the assets of, say, the Transport and General Workers Union, or the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, or ASTMS, is a comparatively small amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What a fine gesture it would be if we could encourage those who control the funds of those great unions to make available £200,000 out of all the millions which they now invest in all sorts of manners—on the Stock Exchange and such other rather sordid affairs in which they get involved. They would not lose it. It would still be there and still be theirs. All they would say is "We shall put it into the new Treasury stock and we shall donate the £30,000 a year which it will earn"—a pretty dirty sort of way for them to earn money, I should have thought—"so that instead of this body being dependent on Government grant and politicians' whim,—perhaps even one day before too long, Conservative politicians' whim—it would stand up proud
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>61</span>
and independent, solid, linked arm-in-arm with those custodians of working class rights, the great trade union movement". So it would not be impossible to raise this sum of money by other means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely fascinated. We can hardly legislate for the trade union movement and decide for it which way it will allocate its funds. I shall certainly convey the message to that movement personally, but I do not think there is much point in pursuing this matter, because we are simply are not going anywhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not want to try to legislate on what the trade union movement does with its funds in this respect. The only point I am seeking to make is that, in moving to delete subsection (1), I do not wish to destroy the concept of this body or bodies. What I am saying is that there are other ways that this money could be obtained. I do not think for a moment that any hon. Gentleman opposite would say "Well, if the Government will not provide this £30,000 a year, certainly the trade union movement would not provide it." I should have thought that all hon. Gentlemen opposite would be willing to stand up and say "For a cause like this where we are legislating that Her Majesty's taxpayers should dub up £30,000 a year, if the taxpayers are a bit hard up, the trade union movement has a fair amount of money and in a good cause like this, of course, it would donate it." Who would dream that Mr. Jones, Mr. Scanlon, Mr. McGarvey and others would be so mean-minded as not to be able to spare a mere £30,000? Parsimony by the Chancellor of the Exchequer is one thing, but parsimony by those men would be a distinctly different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only Parliament that ought to show that it has some faith in the common ownership movement. It would be a good thing if the trade union movement showed it. What better way of showing it than this? I see that I have even persuaded the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. I say quite seriously that it would be desirable that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
the trade union movement should do some of these things. It frequently has done so in the past, and I suggest, as a practical step, that the British Air Line Pilots Association also might well consider it an excellent suggestion. The hon. Member for Chingford is in an excellent position to put it to that association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But all the desirable things that he said here do not diminish the need for us to do what is proposed in the Bill. What he is proposing surely can be supplementary to it. But it would be wrong for us not to press the Government and to accept what is put forward here. However, I hope he will not press his amendment to a vote, since it is merely a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may see that I am not perhaps in the best of positions to press this amendment to a vote at the moment. As to his suggestions, I think that some of them are pretty good. I am sorry that he takes the view that Her Majesty's Government are a softer touch for money for good causes than the trade union movement and that we have to touch Her Majesty's Government first before the trade union movement will dub up. I am a bit disappointed about that. But at least I can undertake that in proportion to its funds certainly I would advocate that the pilots' association should support this proposal to the same extent as the other unions do, in proportion to its funds, because we are rather a small union. There are not many of us and we have not been around for as long as some of the other unions, so our funds are not that large.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we might have a common-owned airline. However, I do not wish to stray too far or delay the progress of the Committee by what is to some extent leg-pulling, although by no means entirely. There is a very serious point behind this, namely, that the amendment does not seek to nobble the Bill. It seeks to point out that there are other ways in which the Bill can be achieved than by relying solely upon Government funds. That is the message that I wanted to get across by what were half jocular but not entirely without hope references

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you will allow me to say a little here, Mr. Jones, on the distinction between the making of grants and the making of loans. Again it is one thing for taxpayers to be advised that it is in the general common good that money should be lent. It is not necessarily so easy to make the case on this Bill that grants should be made to what is described as "any relevant body". We have defined the relevant body, of course. We strongly take the view that any such money that is provided should be by way of loan and not by grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Les Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. I do not want to go over all of the ground that he has covered this morning, though I agree that he has raised some important points, particularly about other people who might be thought to be in a position to pay or at least to make a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) has already said, the trade unions have been in the past and still are contributors to this kind of organisation. One calls to mind the trade union participation in shipbuilding enterprises on the Clyde. One calls to mind various trade union donations to the 	<i>Scottish Daily News</i> and other co-operatives. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will accept that the trade union movement is already making a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about the terms on which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
money may be provided by the body to the enterprises. I want to stress something that my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Clemitson) stressed, that the body itself and not the Secretary of State will appoint the advisers. Obviously, the Secretary of State will wish to know who the advisers are to be, and he may not agree with all the advisers, but it is essentially the body which will appoint the advisers. It is also the body itself which will determine who the recipients of any funds will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the hon. Gentleman has this concern, may I stress to him that the Secretary of State will have to lay regulations before the House about the terms on which this money can go to these enterprises. I give him the assurance that, because he is rightly concerned, he will have the chance of discussing this matter because it will be a resolution of the House. It will have to lay down the conditions and regulations on which the body will be able to do this on-lending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the hon. Gentleman has made an important point. He will also take cognisance of the fact that the Secretary of State will have to do all these things with the consent of the Treasury. It will not be a matter of the Secretary of State thinking that so-and-so seems a good thing to do. It will have to be done with Treasury consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To try to reassure the hon. Gentleman once more, may I say that all of this money—and we are talking about less than half what my hon. Friend originally asked for—will have to come within the existing provision of my Department. It will not come on top of it. In other words, money will have to be found from somewhere else but within the overall total which has already been allocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, having given the hon. Gentleman the assurance that we shall not increase the total allocation to my Department, that all of this will have to be subject to Treasury consent, and having given the undertaking that he will have a chance to discuss all these matters on the regulations which will come before the House to lay down the conditions under which these enterprises can receive this money, I hope that he will realise that it will be a question not just of handing out money but of these enterprises and this body
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0351">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>65</span>
receiving money under conditions which the hon. Gentleman can discuss and, above all, agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether it would be in order for the Under-Secretary to respond briefly to my question, namely, will the Government set an example in the public sector on common ownership experiments? I believe—and this is relevant to discussing whether any public money should go into this—that if the Government were to do it successfully themselves, it would be the best propaganda in the world. I am very old-fashioned in leadership matters; there is no substitute for saying "Follow me" and setting an example oneself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wonder whether the Under-Secretary will consider, in conjunction with his colleagues at the DHSS, trying to make a common ownership experiment in sheltered workshops—he knows I have a lot to do with the disabled. This might easily be a suitable occasion for an experiment. I wonder whether, before the Bill goes on to the statute book, the Under-Secretary would give some indication on this matter, because I am sure it is the wish of the whole Committee that we do not rely on somebody else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government care to the extent that the Under-Secretary says they care—clearly they would not have assisted the sponsors of the Bill so much if they did not care—cannot they set an example themselves? If they did that, this financial grant would be unnecessary because they would be setting a light that would be shining before men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Les Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to help the hon. Gentleman because he has raised an important point. He probably knows that, alongside the inquiry of Lord Bullock into industrial democracy, there is also a parallel inquiry being conducted into the potential of industrial democracy in the public sector. It is important that we do not run in these matters before we can walk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having seen some of the evidence being presented by some trade unions about some industries in the public sector, I should say it may well be the case that the way—perhaps in small, faltering steps—could be prepared along the lines of some of the evidence which is now coming in. That is not to say that what
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
the hon. Gentleman seeks will happen overnight. But some of the experience about some of the enterprises which he has talked about could be channelled ultimately in the direction he mentioned because of the inquiry and the processes which the Government have already started. He will probably know, for example, that Mr. Joe Gormley, the president of the National Union of Mineworkers, has been suggesting something along these lines for collieries. He may know of other examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastleigh referred also to sheltered workshops. This is one of the factors that could well be considered by the appropriate Department; it does not, of course, come under my Department. However, I take his point on board, and I assure him that, if what he seeks is to come about, the current inquiry into industrial democracy in the public sector can possibly pave the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) is right to be concerned about these matters because he wants to know who is to provide the money, and on what terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We know who will provide it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been suggesting others as well. I hope that some of the people he has suggested, particularly in view of what he said about his own union, will note the commitment which he almost made this morning. Even if the hon. Gentleman cannot accept—I hope that he can—all the assurances I have been trying to provide, the answer is really in his own hands, because the regulations which the Secretary of State will have Ito lay before the House governing the on-lending from the body to the enterprises could be subject to negative resolution. In other words, it lies within the hon. Gentleman's power to do what he wishes about debating the regulations on the Floor of the House and studying the terms and conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will not feel that it is just a question of handing out money. It is a question of providing money under carefully researched and defined terms about which, if he is still not satisfied, he can take the matter a good deal further.

I hope, therefore, that he will now feel able to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. It will be a wise Prime Minister who one day, after taking office, will have a note in his diary saying, "Day 1, give coal mines to miners". The hon. Gentleman understands how feel about some of these matters, I am glad to know that this will not result in an increase in this year's Vote for his Department, but, as this is an on-going commitment, I am not sure how he can say that the money will come from funds which the Department would have had anyway. I am sure that, when the Department tots up and puts in its bid for the next Vote, somewhere along the line these sums will be popped in and not lopped off something else. Whatever the Minister says, I am sure we all know that that is the way it will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right to draw my attention to the fact that Treasury consent is required. I was fascinated to notice how heavily he leans upon the Treasury. The Treasury has from time to time given its consent to expenditure which, in retrospect, one or two people have suggested was not altogether wise—and those were not sums of £30,000. They were sums in respect of, for example, Maplin, on which I know some hon. Gentlemen have views, the Channel Tunnel, and Concorde. All these moneys were expended with the Treasury's consent. I may have been consent given at the point of a gun. Consent may hive been dragged out of the Treasury brutally, but consent it gave. So I do not think that we can always rely upon the Treasury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Treasury is tougher about sums of £30,000 than it is about £30 million or £300 million or even £3,000 million. There is a fair amount of evidence that that is true—that Concorde slipped by one morning but that something else would probably finish up on the Chancellor's desk if it were a question of the advisory body getting a grant of £15,000. I can imagine that that may well be the way things work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also observed that my hon. Friends and I who have worries about this clause could have another bite at the cherry when the regulations
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
were put before the House in the form of statutory instrument. There are snags to that, as we all know. For a long time now, Ministers have been giving the line—when I say "Ministers", I do not mean only Ministers of this Government—that if there is a provision that a statutory instrument has to be laid, that means that there will be Parliamentary scrutiny. It is largely a myth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the statutory instrument may not be amended. It can only be accepted or rejected. That in itself is a considerable snag. One might want to go most of the way with what the statutory instrument proposes but not entirely. Under the procedures of the House, however, one can only take it as it is or reject it as it is. We all know the scenes late at night when a Minister of the day says "If you vote against this, you are voting against motherhood"—the flag, employment, or whatever it may be. What the Opposition of the day say is that they do not intend to do that but they would like the flag properly flown, or whatever the case may be. It is, therefore, not a satisfactory procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know also that towards the end of the Session Prayers against statutory instruments and regulations pile up like leaves in autumn under the trees in the parks, and at the finish they get the same kind of short-shrift treatment. They do not have adequate discussion. They do not receive the attention that they should. The more delegated legislation of this sort we pass, the worse matters get. I do not think, therefore, that there is any point in pretending that that is the way out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should recognise that once the Bill is enacted the chance of annulment resolutions is pretty small. Even worse, there is no prospect of amending the regulations. I regret that I cannot, therefore, accept all that he said, although I certainly accept that he said it in the spirit of trying to reach agreement. On this matter I think that we cannot reach agreement. It may be that the issue will be lost today, but I think that we shall have to return to it at some later date, if that is possible without totally disrupting the Bill. I would not wish to destroy the Bill over the issue of statutory instrument procedure. That is not a fault of the Bill; it is something which has built up for years.

I do not intend to die in the last ditch over statutory instruments for this Bill. Considering some of the others that are kicking around the place, I would not want to use that as a tactic to avoid this Bill being enacted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the Committee, perhaps, by hesitating there. We were doing so well, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move, as an amendment to the proposed clause, Amendment (f), in line 29, leave out:
	<br><q><p>'and to include amongst its members one or more representatives of trade unions'.</p></q>
This is the amendment which raises important issues of principle. It was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
not in the original draft of the Bill that the bodies or body should have
	<br><q><p>"to include amongst its members one or more representatives of trade unions".</p></q>
I honestly do not see why this should now be proposed. It would in no way be unfair to the trade union movement if we suggested that just for once it should hold back from insistence on being in on the act. I do not even know whether this has been tacked on in the way that it has because the trade union movement has asked for it formally in any way, or because the Minister thought that it was a good idea, or what representations have been made—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
