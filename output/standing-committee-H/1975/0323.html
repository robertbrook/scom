APPEALS TO APPEALS BOARD AGAINST DIRECTIONS UNDER S.13</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 89, in page 11, line 29, leave out 'may' and insert 'shall'.<br><br>
Perhaps you will permit me Mr. Spence, before I give the reasons for this amendment, to so say how much pleasure it gives at least one member of this Committee, for a special reason, to see you in the Chair, in that you derive your distinguished origin from a place in my constituency, and therefore there is something of special appropriateness—if I may be so impertinent as to say so—in your presiding over the deliberations of a Standing Committee considering a Northern Ireland Bill. For the benefit of the inquisitive, the key word is Ballymartin.<br><br>
I come now to the amendment. At first sight, it might appear to be identical to an amendment which was previously discussed in the context of Clause 8, but this amendment raises matters which are sufficiently different to merit the attention of the Committee. Indeed, had they not been so, your distinguished predecessor in the Chair, Mr. Spence, would either have suggested that the two amendments be taken together, or would not have selected, as she did, this amendment for our consideration.<br><br>
The difference between the two Clauses is that under Clause 8 the Appeals Board is dealing with a person aggrieved by the removal of his name from the register of equal opportunity employers whereas in Clause 14 a much more specific matter is at issue, namely, one or more of the grounds set out in subsection (2). Directions have been given by the agency, of course, and the appellant is arguing either that it is unreasonable for him to comply with them or that compliance with them would not secure equality of opportunity, or that he is already affording equality of opportunity.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
These are, therefore, much more specific matters, and matters of management practice, to which the Appeals Board is giving its attention in deciding whether to allow the appeal. There could not, therefore, be any more direct circumstances in which the contents of the guide and recommendations to which Clause 5 refers, come before the Appeals Board than under this clause.<br><br>
In dealing, with his customary helpfulness and courtesy, with the amendment on the previous clause, the right hon. Gentleman went some way to help in the difficulties which some of us felt on that clause, and I hope that he will be all the more inclined to do so here. I recognise that the simple substitution of "shall" for "may" could have the effect of narrowing the purview of the Appeals Board, so that it could be interpreted that it was only the guide and recommendations to which it was to have regard, but I do not think that would be desired by anybody. On the other hand, it seems grotesque to my hon. Friends and myself that, after consultation with all concerned, the Department should solemnly set out as precisely as it can what is necessary to secure equality of opportunity in management practices and that it should then be left open to the Appeals Board to decide whether it even opens the covers of the guide.<br><br>
I think that we require, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman may come some way to meet us, that the recommendations and the guide are given a more emphatic status, which they logically deserve, in the work of the Appeals Board but that this be done in a manner which does not prevent, and could not be interpreted as preventing, the Appeals Board from considering other matters which might be peculiar to the individual case and might, therefore, not be covered by the recommendations of the guide.<br><br>
Shop-soiled, therefore, though this amendment may appear to the Committee, it raises a distinctive point here which involves the respect and attention that will be given to the guide and the recommendations. There could be ways in which the right hon. Gentleman, if so minded, could meet this point of view, and I hope that he will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. J. D. Concannon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Spence, to our
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0166">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
deliberations. I think that you will find them interesting. You are now the third Chairman that we have had, and I am sure that you are battling in the Chairmen's Panel to come along and listen to our deliberations which, I assure you, are unique among all the committees of which I have had experience.<br><br>
I readily except that what the right hon. Gentleman calls this "shop-soiled" amendment is often the result of someone going through a Bill and wanting to put amendments down but not knowing quite what to do. However, in this case the substitution of "shall" for "may" would certainly create a different situation, and I approach it in that sense.<br><br>
At our last meeting sitting, my right hon. Friend said—it is what we have said all along—that the Appeals Board and the agency should be given some flexibility. This is an area where the flexibility comes in. The effect of the amendment would be to make it mandatory for the Fair Employment Appeals Board, when considering appeals against the directions of the Fair Employment Agency, to have regard to the recommendations contained in the guide to good manpower policy and practice.<br><br>
It appears that the right hon. Gentleman wants that to be mandatory. The Government do not think that it is right—nor do we think it acceptable—to fetter the hands of this body in such a way. The Appeals Board should be able to consider all relevant matters but not be compelled to have regard to any particular one. The use of the word "may" reflects the freedom of action which my right hon. Friend stressed at the last sitting. The word "shall", as proposed, is undesirably rigid. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept my answer in that spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can bring the Under-Secretary a little further. He will recollect that at the penultimate meeting of the Committee—this is columns <i>217–8</i> of <i>Hansard</i>—an exchange took place between the right hon. Gentleman and myself on this subject. I suggested that we were really looking for something in the sense of "shall" among other considerations have regard to". I am not so impertinent as to imagine that words could be slipped into a Bill as easily as that, but he will take the general sense.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
The right hon. Gentleman was good enough to say that, while he thought that the subsection as it stood met the point then being made, he would have another look at it and, if necessary, bring it back to Committee. I think that he may have meant bring it back to the House at a subsequent stage. I ask the Under-Secretary to repeat <i>a fortiori</i> in this connection which his right hon Friend was good enough to make.<br><br>
I repeat that there is no intention—it would be absurd to try—to narrow the purview of the matters which the Appeals Board may take into account, but we think it desirable that its intention should mandatorily be directed to the recommendations and guide, though it should not be restricted to it.<br><br>
I give this further commendation. If employers and all concerned who are to deal with these matters, in considering, for example, with their legal advisers whether or not to appeal, read on the face of the statute that that guide and those recommendations are matters to which the Appeals Board is to have regard, they will certainly study the guide and recommendations. There could be no more effective advertisement for the guide and recommendations, which is what I presume Ministers desire, than knowledge among all concerned that they were to be a factor—not the sole factor—in the decisions upon appeals. Can the hon. Gentleman come that little step further?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman does not want to make this a rigid proposal and is wondering whether we have the words right to cover the point, I can repeat what was said by my right hon. Friend, that we shall look at this matter again. We think—we have been through this several times—that we have the wording of the clause right, but, on the understanding that the right hon. Gentleman does not want rigidly to apply this to the Appeals Board, we shall look at it again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. I am fortified by the indications of assent coming from the Minister of State, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0167">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When our proceedings ended last Thursday, the Minister of State indicated that was on this Question he would be able to deal with some of the textual matters. Without making heavy weather of them, I therefore remind the Committee of those textual matters. I do not think one needs emphasise that wording in a statute is of great importance, and it is the more important for us since this legislation is to some extent, innovatory. This is a kind of language which has not—at least, not fully—been previously explored in statutory terms, and therefore I am sure that we are not wasting time, though I doubt that future generations of lawyers will thank us, in putting the maximum precision that we can into the terminology.<br><br>
The point to which I was drawing the Committee's attention in this textual context was that no fewer than four different verbs are applied in this Bill to equality of opportunity, with the employer as the subject of the verbs. They are, in order, "provide" in Clause 12(1)(<i>a</i>), "ensure" in Clause 13(1)(<i>a</i>), "secure" in Clause 14(2)(<i>b</i>) and "afford" in Clause 14(2)(<i>c</i>). I am quite aware that "secure" is used elsewhere with bodies and persons other than the employer as the subject. Nevertheless, in the ill-fated Schedule 3—the declaration, which we all hope will be redrawn before we finally add anything of that kind to the Bill—it is there, too, the employer and not the agency that does the securing. There may be some important difference, some difference visible to an eye less acute or less far-seeing than that of the parliamentary draftsman, between providing equality of opportunity, ensuring equality, securing equality of opportunity and affording equality of opportunity when all these things are being done by an employer. But, unless there is a clear difference which can be explained and justified, we should be infringing one of the canons of statute making in using different terms to mean the same thing.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
This is not a marginal matter with which we are dealing here. We are not dealing with one of the marginalia in this Bill. We are dealing with the central concept of equality of opportunity. The basic duty on which the rest of Part II, at any rate, turns is the basic duty of the employer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
to do something about equality of opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman will make a declaration as to which of the four verbs he prefers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a very attractive proposal. I was hoping that the Government, with their superior advisers, would opt for one of the four verbs, stick to it throughout, and impose it throughout. As the hon. Member has flattered me by asking me to express a preference, I will do so. It is not apart from the point to do so, because the one which I prefer illustrates the anxieties I have in regard to the rest. The one which I prefer is "afford", because that implies that, so far as it is within the power of the employer, that is what he will do.<br><br>
But it is claiming too much and imposing too much to say to an employer "You must ensure" something. None of us can be sure of the consequences of our actions. Is it the second or third of Harold Wilson's laws of politics that actions have the opposite result to that which was intended? The perfectly innocent employer may find that he is far from ensuring that which he intended.<br><br>
The same objection would attach to "secure", and although "provide" is less objectionable than "secure" or "ensure", it is less appropriate to the limitation upon what the employer can do, with all the good will in the world. With the assistance of the hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham) I find myself putting a more precise proposition to the Government than I had intended. Indeed, I am putting two propositions: first, that unless there is some significance difference in the context, where the employer is the subject of the verb, the Government should choose one verb and stick to it; secondly, the best word in my view is "afford".<br><br>
One of the charms of our procedure in Standing Committee is that the intimations of what may be about to happen are a little more visible than they sometimes are on the Floor of the House. Yet they still have that charm, that little tension that, although one is aware that something is going to happen, one can never be quite sure in advance what it is.<br><br>
I resume my seat in a positive dither of pleasurable anticipation.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0168">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has, in his usual lucid manner, hit on the matter of the four verbs. I promise that we will look at all these words again and come back with the Government's choice of words on Report. Whether it will be on the lines that the right hon. Gentleman suggests or whether we come to some other words, obviously I cannot say at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand from the Minister's reply that he has accepted that uniformity of diction where the employer is the subject is desirable and that he intends to secure it. That being so, we look forward to the lexicographical choice, which, after having consulted Roget's <i>Thesaurus,</i> no doubt the parliamentary draftsmen will make in the weeks that will elapse between this sitting and our seeing the amendments on Report.</span></p>

Clause 15</div> <!-- clause -->

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ENFORCEMENT BY COUNTY COURT OF UNDERTAKING OR DIRECTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 91, in page 11, line 33, after 'period', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'of not less than one month'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 94, in page 12, line 9, leave out paragraph (<i>a</i>).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This will change the text of Clause 15(1):
<br><blockquote><p>"Where, within such period as the Agency considers reasonable"</p></blockquote>
to read:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where, within such period of not less than one month".</p></blockquote>
In moving this amendment, we hope that we shall not again be accused of being two-faced in our approach to the Bill. Hopefully, we see this as an improvement. It lays a discipline upon the agency, and it will bring about a consistency of approach. What precisely do the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"as the Agency considers reasonable"</p></blockquote>
mean? Do they mean that in the circumstances which the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) described as applying in his
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
constituency, the agency would view the affairs of that particular company and the circumstances surrounding it in one light and the affairs of a company situated, perhaps, in Down, North in a totally different light? One would have a situation where the agency dealing with the whole matter of seeking enforcement would take into account circumstances which, while one could understand them—and we are particularly concerned about them—would mean that one company could rightfully feel aggrieved that it was being treated completely differently from another because of circumstances over which it had no control.<br><br>
To some extent, this is a probing amendment, because we should like to know what is in the Minister's mind regarding the agency's approach to this particular problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is another aspect to which, I hope, the Minister will give attention. You very wisely, Mr. Spence, suggested that we should consider this amendment in connection with a proposal to leave out paragraph (2) (<i>a</i>). As the clause stands, the person to whom the directions are issued or by whom the undertaking is made has three weeks in which to appeal under Clause 14(1) to the appeals board. Until those three weeks have elapsed, the agency cannot come upon him by applying to the county court for enforcement.<br><br>
One of the questions which we raise by these amendments is whether, after the period of appeal has elapsed, it would not be wise for the appeals board mandatorily to have to allow a further period to elapse. We have suggested in our very modest amendment the lapse of only a further week. But I put to the Government that, bearing in mind that at each stage the policy is to try to bring the employer along and to try to secure a common point of agreement between the agency and the employer, they ought not to cover him the day after his right of appeal has expired.<br><br>
Let us consider the position of an employer to whom a direction has been issued and who consults his legal advisers. He talks to his personnel manager, he of course reads once again his well-thumbed copy of the Department of Manpower's guide and recommendations, and he consults his solicitor. I think hon. Members will agree that that is a process which, in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0169">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
ordinary life, takes all of three weeks. At the end of three weeks—which is his maximum period for appealing—the employer decides "No, I shall not appeal; my case is not strong enough".<br><br>
What we do not want to happen is that, on the following Monday morning, he receives notice from the agency that it is taking him to the county court. We want to ensure that he knows that he at least has a period after the three weeks for appeal to elapse in which he can, so to speak, make his peace with the agency.<br><br>
I believe that the agency has power at each stage to vary the undertaking or the directions, and it might well arise than an employer who set out in a mood to see the thing through to appeal, might, after considering it during those three weeks, say to the agency "Cannot we arrive at an understanding about that?"<br><br>
It may be that a month is too modest. I am inclined to think that in asking for a month—which is only one week over the odds—my hon. Friend was too modest, and that, if we are to achieve the object of the amendment, we probably need at least six weeks. But that is an aspect of the matter which I hope the Government will consider before making up their minds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the clause stands at present, by virtue of subsection (4), the agency cannot apply for a court order to enforce a direction until the period of 21 days during which the respondent may appeal to the appeals board has expired, or, if an appeal has been lodged, until it has been abandoned or dismissed. Thus, in effect, the agency may not seek the enforcement of a direction within 21 days of its being issued. I might add that it is always open to respondents to negotiate with the agency for such period as they may require to comply with undertakings or directions. It is always open to them to negotiate with the agency any length of time they wish.<br><br>
Regarding directions, the agency will be able to modify its requirements, on the application of the respondent, by virtue of its powers provided by Clause 13(5), though where it is not prepared to allow sufficient time for the direction to be complied with, it would be open to the respondent to appeal under Clause 14(2)(<i>a</i>), on the grounds that, in all the circumstances, it is unreasonable to expect
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
him to comply. The directions then could not be enforced or complied with until the appeal proceedings had been completed.<br><br>
Clearly, it is important that practices which do not secure equality of opportunity should be remedied speedily, and that undertakings or directions to do so should be implemented without unjustifiable delay. In the circumstances, and as we wish—as my right hon. Friend and I have tried to explain—to give a great deal of flexibility here, we consider that there are adequate safeguards against respondents before we can occupy a time-scale on this matter. It is not a case of 21 days; each employer can negotiate, and if he has reasonable ground for an extension of time, then that is applicable within the Articles, as I have said.</span></p>
<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is one point to which, I think, the Minister has not given sufficient weight. It is, in fact, a point on which I sought to intervene, in order to save time and to bring to his attention that in real life, during the period available for an appeal, it is very unlikely, and might indeed be unwise, for the potential appellant to say to the agency "Give us a guide or, at any rate, give us some time". I am sure that a legal adviser whom a potential appellant was consulting would discourage him from making any contact with the agency of the sort which the hon. Member suggested during the period available for the appeal.<br><br>
Irrespective of the general policy of the Bill, if an undertaking is given, if directions are issued, they must be complied with. Our argument is not that there should be any dilatoriness in doing so but that by allowing a <i>locus penitentiae</i>—I do not know whether, Mr. Spence, you require the same exactitude in translation of Latin expressions as has been hitherto customary in the Committee but, if you do, that would mean opportunity for repentance. We are anxious to ensure that there is sufficient opportunity for thinking again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The confessional?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The confessional would be another translation—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am greatly tempted, Mr. Spence to enter
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0170">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 301</span>
into a discussion of the respective merits of the Bill. In the next clause, we are coming to the respective merits of individual and general confession, but that would be more than is implicit in the translation of a mere Latin tag.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It does not mean "Opportunity Knocks". We can be clear on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am merely saying that if the potential appellant knows on the face of the Bill that he still has some time before an application to the court can be pushed in, after his three weeks has elapsed, which is not very long for lodging an appeal, there will be some cases in which we will get agreement where otherwise court proceedings will in fact follow. The Minister did not entirely cover that point when he replied, and I hope he will take it into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have already been assured that the directions will not include numerical quotas from the agency, so we are concerned here with the directions being given to a company on its recruitment practices. I am at a loss to understand which of these items is likely to cause disagreement and argument between the agency and the employer. Obviously, as we discussed last week, the agency will be concerned about whether the employer is advertising enough, recruiting from a sufficiently large area, or making efforts to recruit from the unemployed, and so on. I should like some concrete examples here. Surely the only negotiations that can take place between the employer and the agency would be, for instance, when an employer from, say, Falls Road said to the agency "There is no point in my advertising in the <i>Newsletter</i> or going to such-and-such a school for recruits, because it will only create problems for me. If I recruit someone who is prepared to work in my factory, he may be risking his life, and it will only create a situation which will give me more trouble."<br><br>
I would better understand this matter if the Under-Secretary could say what he thinks may happen and what an employer is likely to negotiate with the agency.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Concannon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to drag me into fields which we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 302</span>
discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> on Second Reading and have continued discussing in the Committee. It is not for me to say what the agency will find and what it will do. The effect of the amendment, of course, would be that the agency could not apply for a court order if anything was amiss until after one month. As I have explained to the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), there are 21 days before the agency can go for a court order. The respondents then have a chance to negotiate with the agency if they want extra time and the application is reasonable. There is also the chance of an appeal.<br><br>
In all the circumstances, we feel that the safeguards for the respondents are pretty well covered in this clause.</span></p>

MEANING OF "DISCRIMINATION" AND "UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION"</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 96, in page 12, line 31, leave out 'or political opinion'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 97, in page 12, line 36, leave out from 'religious' to 'he' in line 37 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'profession if on that ground'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are now not only entering upon a new Part of the Bill but we are opening one of the more important debates in the course of our proceedings. It is perhaps useful to be conscious of what is happening as we pass from Part II to Part III. Part II hung upon the ensuring—or whatever be the appropriate word—of equality of opportunity. That was defined for the purposes of the Bill in Clause 3.<br><br>
We now come to the manner of dealing with specific cases of alleged discrimination which, although linked with denial of equality of opportunity as defined in Clause 3, is not identical with it. We come to an area of the Bill which my hon. Friends and I find more practical and less beset with some of the difficulties, adverse consequences and counter-productive effects which we have so often brought to the Committee's attention.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0171">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 303</span>
It is, therefore, important to look at the definition of "discrimination" and compare it with the definition of, as the opposite, "equality of opportunity" in Clause 3. Immediately we do this, we notice that in Clause 3 reference is made only to
<br><blockquote><p>"equality of opportunity between persons of different religious beliefs".</p></blockquote>
There is no reference to any other criterion of equality of opportunity between persons otherwise in the same situation.<br><br>
In Clause 16(1)(<i>a</i>), in addition to religious belief, we find an alternative, namely, the words "or political opinion". It is important that the Committee should focus its attention upon those words and decide whether they are necessary or helpful in securing the prevention of discrimination on religious grounds.<br><br>
The second of the amendments would incidentally substitute "profession" for "belief" in the second place where the word "belief" occurs. As you have not selected Amendment No. 95 for debate, Mr. Spence, I do not propose to deal with that problem in connection with the definition of "belief" and the question whether "religious belief" is the correct terminology. We have debated that before and we shall, no doubt, be coming to it again in the definition clause. I am simply concerned here—and it is sufficient—with the wisdom or otherwise of adding the alternative grounds of discrimination, namely, political opinion.<br><br>
I am sorry that, as so often is the case in our deliberations, the Chairman of the Working Party which produced the Report which lies behind the Bill is not present, though the right hon. Gentleman has relieved some of our anxieties by indicating that neither in legislation nor in practice will he adhere slavishly to the van Straubenzee Report. It is, however, surprising how this comes in the Report. In paragraph 6 of the introduction, the Working Party sets out how it got down to work. Paragraph 5 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The meaning of the term 'religious discrimination' is widely understood in Northern Ireland"—</p></blockquote>
and it then goes on blandly to observe in paragraph 6:
<br><blockquote><p>"We also agreed that the term 'religious discrimination' should be taken to include discrimination on political grounds. We did so because we recognise the close connection between politics and religion in Northern Ireland. It is important to ensure that any
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 304</span>
measures adopted to deal with religious discrimination do not leave loopholes for its practice in another guise."</p></blockquote>
With the greatest possible respect to the hon Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee), there is a gross fallacy in that paragraph which, in my submission, resulted in the Working Party misdirecting itself in this acceptance of its terms of reference. It is, I think, the fallacy known to logicians as that of the unresolved middle. It says that there is a close connection between politics and religion in Northern Ireland. So, indeed, there is, but that is no reason to say that the term "religious discrimination" should be taken to include discrimination upon political grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could I help the right hon. Gentleman, since we are not having a formal debate, as we would in the House, but are merely to exchange views? I want to hear the right hon. Gentleman's opinions, as, I am sure, he wishes to hear the Government's opinions. I thought that we made progress last Thursday in exchanging views and interpretation, as he has outlined, and I hope that he realises how I, at least, would like to see the Bill interpreted.<br><br>
Our reason for including these words is this. Because of the correlation between religion and politics in Northern Ireland, we envisage that employers could, in effect, avoid their responsibility by discriminating on a political base while at the same time suggesting or implying that they were discriminating on a religious base. One must catch the two. Otherwise one would be played off against the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for intervening, and I am sure that the Government's intention is well understood, but to illustrate the difficulties which, in our opinion, the specification of political opinion will cause, it may be most convenient to concentrate attention upon the alleged reason in paragraph 6 of the Working Party Report. If we can get hold of that fallacy, we shall get to the root of the difficulties which we on this bench apprehend.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
If I may resume, it is not, of course, disputed that there is a close overlap between religious and political affiliation in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0172">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 305</span>
Northern Ireland. There is a close connection between the two. But one cannot say, because there is a close connection between the two, that religious discrimination includes political discrimination. One could say that only if religion were the only ground of political discrimination. Only if politics were solely a function of religion in Northern Ireland would the statement of the Working Party that religious discrimination should be taken to include discrimination on political grounds be valid.<br><br>
I put this argument forward not as a matter of logic chopping. There is here a real practical difficulty. For example, there have been bitter political differences in Northern Ireland in the past two years between people of the same religious belief, persuasion, affiliation—call it what one will. There was a bitter political difference not on personalities but on policy between the right hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig) and the rest of his then colleagues in the United Ulster Unionist Coalition. It was a bitter difference. There was a bitter difference of opinion between Mr. Faulkner, the former Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and a large section of the Unionist Party. That difference of political opinion—it could be no other—subsisted irrespective of the fact that all the parties to that difference were on the same side of the political divide—to those who see it in those terms—and in all probability many of them were of the same religious sect in the narrowest definition of the term "religious sect".<br><br>
Therefore, we are forced to accept that, although in Northern Ireland religion has much more to do with political opinion and affiliation than it does in Great Britain—although it has something to do with it in Great Britain—it is by no means the sole ground of division of political opinion. Not merely shading of political opinion but differences of political opinion are so bitter that in the pursuit and deciding of them men are prepared to destroy one another's career and prospects.<br><br>
In my own constituency there has undoubtedly until recently been a political divide between what are called the Faulknerites and what are called the Official Unionists. It seems to me perfectly possible—indeed, probable—that there would be discrimination on political
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 306</span>
grounds between adherents of those two political opinions. When feelings run high and differences are deep, it is human nature—the sort of human nature which in the religious context we are trying to counteract—that people should be influenced in their secular concerns by what they know or believe about another man's politics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But would not the right hon. Gentleman agree with this? Let us take a Great Britain situation where one has members of the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Parties applying for jobs. If they were discriminated against because they had political opinions, that would be wrong. There is not a law to operate on that in this country because there are other ways of overcoming it. I have known of discrimination in British industry based on political opinions. But that is overcome mainly by the trade unions. However, where the divisions arise in Northern Ireland—about which the right hon. Gentleman is talking—between, say, the right hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig) and the right hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley), they are about real political arguments. Where those divisions show themselves, that, in relation to the Bill, would not be seen as political discrimination in the terms about which the right hon. Gentleman is talking; it would fall back to Part II, on religious discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for the closeness with which he is following the argument. Indeed, he was anticipating something to which I intended to refer. However, could I latch on to his last remarks straight away, because I am not sure that I understood them, and I think they may have surprised the Committee.<br><br>
Did I understand the right hon. Gentleman to say that if it were proved or believed that an employer in South Down had preferred one applicant for a job to another, because applicant A was an Official Unionist and applicant B was a Faulknerite, that would not come within the scope of this Bill? That is what I understand him to say, but it is not how I read the definition in Clause 16(1)(<i>a</i>). That subsection does not say
<br><blockquote><p>"religious belief or political opinion allied with religious belief".</p></blockquote>
It says "or political opinion". I hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0173">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 307</span>
that, if the right hon. Gentleman was mistaken in that part of his intervention, he will subsequently take the opportunity to put the record right.<br><br>
I come now to the major point in the right hon. Gentleman's intervention. He says that one can have discrimination on political grounds which have nothing to do with religion. Why not cover that, too, in the Bill? I want to face that head on. If we are to have legislation to deal with discrimination on non-religious political grounds, then why only Northern Ireland? That is something which on the admission of the right hon. Gentleman may take place—does take place—in Great Britain. That is something which should be considered in its own right, and its appropriateness or otherwise should be considered. It should not be dealt with merely because, on a piece of bad logic, the working party has hooked in political opinion as a ground of discrimination so that the Bill proceeds upon the general Northern Ireland background of what is called the religious divide, and then we discover that in Northern Ireland alone, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, discrimination on non-religious political opinion—on grounds of political opinion between co-religionists—is to be discrimination dealt with in the terms of Part III of the Bill.<br><br>
Clearly the right hon. Gentleman was conscious of that difficulty. If he had not been he would not have resorted to an extremely weak argument. I hope that he will have a <i>locus penitentiae</i> for reconsidering that argument. He said that it was all right in Great Britain because, if there is discrimination on political grounds, the trade unions will deal with it. I am not sure that the trade unions in Great Britain are so extensive, for example, in agriculture, that he could put hand on heart and say "There will not be any political discrimination in Great Britain without the trade unions coming down bang on the employer."<br><br>
There are many circumstances—unionised and non-unionised—in which such political discrimination could take place in Great Britain. Also, if the trade union are the guardians of this matter, I would ask the right hon. Gentleman—and this was the second implication of his remarks—to be a little more cautious in how he draws a contrast between the operations of trade unions in Northern Ireland and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 308</span>
the operations of trade unions in Great Britain.<br><br>
In short, I think the Committee should dismiss that part of the hon. Gentleman's intervention as being evidence of the fact that he recognises that it would be intolerable for us to legislate for Northern Ireland against discrimination on non-religious political grounds when there is no intention to do so in the rest of Great Britain.<br><br>
If there is a case for the law being brought into political discrimination this ought to be done upon as mature a consideration as was given to religious discrimination in the case of Northern Ireland. It ought to be a statute which applies to the whole of the United Kingdom. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will reconsider that.<br><br>
As Clause 16(1) stands, we are inviting the application of the whole of the machinery of Parts III and IV, I think, to matters which have nothing to do with religious difference or religious discrimination. We are inviting the application of the Bill to an entirely different area from that in which the appropriateness and necessity of this legislation has been considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman puts the argument that the cases he sited, for instance, had nothing to do with religious discrimination, I accept that. But we in Northern Ireland know that religious discrimination and political affiliation in the broad sense are often synonymous. If the cases which the right hon. Gentleman posed are not just discrimination, but genuine political differences, that is one thing. But if political affiliation is used as a pretext for religious discrimination, Part III of the Bill deals with it. That is central to the argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am much obliged. As the hon. Gentleman said, if these are genuine political differences, they are one thing. But he did not say whether that one thing was inside the Bill as at present drafted, or outside it. The trouble is that he has that one thing in the Bill. There is nothing in the Bill which says that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, within the terms of the Bill.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0174">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 309</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and this is the difficulty. Yet the right hon. Gentleman is agreeing with me that true political difference of opinion, such as the example I gave—which occurs bitterly between co-religionists—is a different matter from discrimination and denial of equality of opportunity which is the subject matter of the Bill.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman readily conceded a great deal of the case for my amendment. But I understand his difficulty. He is right in saying that this Committee stage ought to be, in some respects, a matter of collaboration, and I am endeavouring to collaborate with him. He says that what we want to catch it discrimination which is overtly based upon political difference—because a person is a member of the SDLP—but which is really based upon the fact that he is a Roman Catholic.<br><br>
I do not think that we would disagree with that. If we are making it unlawful to discriminate on religious grounds, no Member of this Committee would say "Ah yes, but we want to leave loopholes whereby religious discrimination can take place under other pretexts".<br><br>
The trouble with the Bill as it stands is that it does not define political opinion in such a way as to catch political opinion which is in reality based upon religious affiliation as a ground of discrimination.<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman says "Ah, but you are making things very difficult, it is very difficult to put that nuance—important, real and recognisable though it is in real life—into an Act of Parliament", I am afraid that I shall retort "It is not my hon. Friends and I who encouraged you to deal with this by Act of Parliament. But since you are dealing with it by Act of Parliament, the onus is upon you to define the forms of discrimination on grounds of political opinion which are within—or should be within—the mischief of the Bill because they are really discrimination upon religious grounds".<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
Being aware, from many years of experience, of the powers and ingenuity of those who draft statutes, I would not think that it was impossible, if that is the intention, for the Bill to find the means—perhaps in the definition clause, for all I know—of setting on one side, and I am almost using the right hon. Gentleman's words, mere difference of political opinion
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 310</span>
as a ground of discrimination and hooking in discrimination which is overtly alleged to be due to political affiliation, but is based on religious antagonism or prejudice.<br><br>
Before I conclude, I should like to give another concrete example that frequently occurs in real life, which I put on Second Reading and which is material here.<br><br>
The Provisional Sinn Fein is not an illegal organisation. It is a political party to which it is lawful to belong. I do not know what are the preponderant religious beliefs of the members of Provisional Sinn Fein. Personally, from their behaviour, I would not give much for the religious beliefs of most of them. I am not sure that we are not stretching the term "religious belief" far beyond its natural means—and I do not want to get into a different debate—by talking about the religious beliefs of some of the people who are covered by that description. Nevertheless, it is a lawful, political association. It is a political opinion, I suppose, which is held by a member of Provisional Sinn Fein. It is the mark of his political opinions. He would be asociated, in many cases, with one religious community.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) need not—but perhaps he will—remind the Committee that such attitudes to which I have alluded are not restricted to Provisional Sinn Fein and are not restricted to those of a religious persuasion which might wrongly be identified with Provisional Sinn Fein. I make the point, <i>in concreto,</i> simply to oblige the right hon. Gentleman to face the real difficulties.<br><br>
Let us take the example of an employer and two potential employees. One is a professed member of Provisional Sinn Fein. The other is—if I dare to say it—perfectly law-abiding, whatever is his religion or aspirations. He is not a member of an activist organisation. I am trying to be as neutral and as general as I can. Is it the intention of the Bill to go after discrimination in such circumstances? Both answers to that question present difficulties. If the right hon. Gentleman says "Yes, because this might merely be to screen the fact that the employer hates the individual because he is a Roman Catholic", we must devise methods whereby those authorities to whom the matter is ultimately referred will make up their own minds, as courts of law will make up their minds, as to where the truth lies, even though the truth may be a matter of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0175">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 311</span>
motive. So that will come back to the drafting and to the words which can be put in a statute and around which the decision of the court can revolve.<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman says, "No, Of course not, because that is straight politics, and it is common sense that an employer will think much more often than twice before he employs a member of the Provisional Sin Fein whose intentions in applying for employment may not be unmixed," I say that he has to find a means of excluding from the Bill discrimination upon genuine political grounds.<br><br>
Political differences and political discrimination therefore do exist in Northern Ireland. They exist on a substantial scale altogether outside considerations of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has cited the Provisional Sinn Fein as a lawful organisation. We could perhaps pick on the majority of the community and cite the UDA. There could be members of the UDA and members of the Provisional Sinn Fein who are law-abiding citizens. Why, therefore, should they not be covered by the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is for the right hon. Gentleman to decide whether he wants the Bill to deal with political opinion unconnected with grounds of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But it is connected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman now hops from one foot to another. Not so long ago he was telling the Committee that political opinion is brought in here because it can be the pretext of what is really religious discrimination, and therefore, to deal with religious discrimination, we must prevent the evasion and the pretence that discrimination which was really on the grounds of religion was on the ground of politics.<br><br>
On that, I think we are all at one with the right hon. Gentleman. Where we will not be at one is if he says "Incidentally"—although it is not a matter which has been ventilated in the context of this Bill—"while I am about it, I might as well deal with discrimination on grounds of political opinion having nothing whatsoever to do with grounds of religion".<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman is saying that, I am sure that he will find many in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 312</span>
the Committee who will wish to deny him the right to legislate in that respect by a side wind. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will understand that in second example I was pursuing the same issue, and I would have pursued it with whatever cases I was inserting.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman is to consider this matter between now and the next stage, but I appeal to him to recognise now that he is obliged so to define the ambit of political opinion for the purposes of Part III of the Bill that it serves the purpose and only the purpose which has throughout been put forward, namely, to prevent political opinion being a let-out for those who are actually discriminating on religious grounds. If he will do that, he will have a more workable Bill, one which is more readily accepted and a Bill which still stops the loopholes that the working party wanted to stop. I do not believe that it is beyond human ingenuity to do that. That is our appeal on these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gerald Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) seeks to create the impression that conditions in Northern Ireland are at present, or should be, the same as in any other part of the United Kingdom. In doing so, he is flying in the face of the history of Northern Ireland and what we know to be the realities within the context of discrimination on the ground of religion and political opinion.<br><br>
We know the realities; and it is much more than an academic exercise in this Committee to try and draw parallels and to drag in red herrings such as has just been done by the right hon. Gentleman when he seeks to equate a difference of political opinion between the right hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig) and the right hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley). It must be the twentieth time that I have said during the course of this Committee that that is not the problem in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Vote for the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem in Northern Ireland is the discrimination and victimisation which has existed and was levelled by the majority Protestant community against the minority Catholic community, and in some instances the other way round.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 313</span>
The facts of life in Northern Ireland are that where a person lives—particularly since the outbreak of the present troubles which have led to the creation of a ghetto system when Catholics live in one area and Protestants live in another—is sufficient indication of his religious and political affiliation.<br><br>
For example, there could be a man living in the Falls Road who would not have any political affiliations and who would not give any support to the SDLP, Sinn Fein or any other political party. But if he applies for a job the prospective employer would say "That man lives in a Catholic ghetto, therefore the chances are that he is opposed to the Unionist Party". Conversely, a man may have very strong political beliefs. He may be a strong supporter of Provisional Sinn Fein or the SDLP and have no religious beliefs whatsoever. But the fact that he lives in that area would be sufficient evidence to indicate that he was anti-Protestant, anti-UUC or anti-Establishment politically—union or party-wise in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
We have just had the winding-up of the Convention in Northern Ireland. Ivan Cooper, who was a well-respected member of the SDLP, was a Protestant. He was not a member of the Catholic faith. He will have to seek employment in Northern Ireland, and he may not be successful in getting that employment. If his prospective employer is a Unionist or has a large number of Protestant employees on his staff, people may be inclined to think that Ivan Cooper has not got that job because he was a member of the SDLP. That is why it is so necessary to have in the Bill the words which the right hon. Gentleman seeks to delete.<br><br>
To show the closeness of the association between religion and politics in Northern Ireland let me give an example. Many hon. Members will remember the industrial firm in Northern Ireland of Grundig. It would not, perhaps, have been so much affected by this Bill as other firms—Grundig employed both Catholic and Protestant labour. As normally happens in Northern Ireland, from the beginning to the end of July there is a heightening of tension. There is marching in the streets, fiery speeches being made, there is the commemoration of the Battle of the Boyne and an assertion of the supremacy of one trade in Northern Ireland over the other. We have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
lived with this for centuries.<br><br>
On those occasions the majority Protestant work-force uses its political symbols—which would not be regarded as political symbols in other parts of the United Kingdom. For example, the Union Jack, which is not regarded as a political symbol here—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be by the Conservative Party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is, it should not be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The symbol that created the trouble at this factory was a flag, but it was the Vanguard flag.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can have different political symbols, as my right hon. Friend says. There can be Vanguard flags and Union Jacks—even photographs of the Queen and members of the Royal Family—regarded as political symbols in Northern Ireland. In that particular case, it happened that Catholic workers, carrying on their everyday activity in their job, went to work one morning around 12th July and found that the workbench where they normally carried out their work was decorated with Union Jacks, Vanguard flags and photographs of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.<br><br>
The workers of Northern Ireland know well the correlation between religion and political belief. Otherwise, why would the work force in that particular factory, if they paid such allegiance to the Queen and the British connection, take what they regard as their political symbols and put them on the workbench of someone they believe is opposed to the political association between Great Britain and Northern Ireland? Those are the realities of life.<br><br>
We had a debate on the Floor of the House yesterday afternoon on the severe unemployment position in Northern Ireland, which brought total unanimity of all the representatives in the House on trying to take whatever steps were possible—or, at least, we advocated our position to the Minister so that he could take whatever steps were possible—to try to do away

with the present unemployment in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
This Bill is about trying to create in industrial establishments a balanced work force, if possible without registers, to try to ensure that people will get a job in any industrial establishment, where their religious beliefs or political affiliations will be of no moment. But again—I am sure that the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) will agree with me—we are talking about real facts of life in Northern Ireland. This is not an academic exercise. In the Belfast shipyard—we have mentioned this before, so I cannot be accused of opening up a new argument—the work force is almost 10,000; there are 9,800 Protestants and 200 Catholics. Included in the Protestant work force there would be supporters of the right hon. Member for Belfast, East, of the hon. Member for Belfast, South—and perhaps supporters of mine, although they would be a small minority. Within the Protestant majority work force there would be Church of Ireland adherents, Presbyterians, Free Presbyterians and Methodists. The big issue here is that there are only 200 Catholics.<br><br>
As elected representatives, we have tried desperately hard, and certainly a great deal of credit must go to my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, who tried everything he could to keep that shipyard in existence, for which I congratulate him. Consider that shipyard, and then consider another smaller one, because effectively most of the large industrial establishments are Establishment or Unionist-oriented, and most of the small ones could perhaps give their allegiance to the Catholic minority or political viewpoint. I am thinking of a small firm where there are 200 or 300 Catholics and no Protestants involved.<br><br>
When the threat of redundancy comes about in a Belfast shipyard, where there is likely to be a big pay-off for the work force, the Catholics living in an area where there is an awful lot of unemployment, such as my own, in West Belfast, are inclined to have very little sympathy for the proposed pay-off in the Belfast shipyard. They take the view "I never worked there. Very few people with whom I associate, or my co-religionists, work there, so it is not going to harm us".<br><br>
The same thing would happen if there was a threat of redundancy in a Catholic-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
owned establishment, where there is an almost 100 per cent. political and religious affiliation of the workers. Those who are Protestants would say "It does not worry us; we were not going to get a job there anyway". Those are the facts of life and we cannot separate them. I only wish that we could, and I shall do everything I possibly can, in this Committee and elsewhere, to try to arrive at the happy position where the religion or the political belief of an applicant will be of no moment. But that is not the position in Northern Ireland today.<br><br>
The Bill seeks to prevent discrimination or victimisation being used against anyone on the grounds of religious and political beliefs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And, because the two go together. They are so closely entwined, brought about by centuries of Irish history and the unhappy tragedy that we have had in Northern Ireland, that they cannot be separated. They are a fact of life in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I do not think that the Minister of State is getting himself into an embarrassing or difficult position. I fully support what he is doing. He is facing the realities of what political and religious divisions mean in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I do not believe that the right hon. Member for Down, South would himself ever be involved in discriminating on grounds of religion in Northern Ireland. It may be unfair, but, after listening to the right hon. Gentleman, both in this Committee and elsewhere, I should be inclined to isolate him from his colleagues in this context. In the light of the opposition which has been expressed by some Union Members towards the most important parts of the Bill, and in the light of what has been said throughout our debates, I do not think I should be far wrong in trying to distinguish or differentiate the activities and opinions expressed by the right hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman is no fool in this matter. He knows that he cannot claim the same conditions within the context of this Bill for Northern Ireland as for the rest of the United Kingdom. He knows that very well. We have to try to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0178">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
grapple with the problem which exists in Northern Ireland. We hope this legislation will do something to dispel or to alleviate those problems. The realities are there in Northern Ireland. I believe that, if we were to accept this amendment proposed by the right hon. Gentleman, it would lead to a weakening of the Bill which would make it far less effective than either I or the Government would wish it to be. I believe that the clause as drafted, without the right hon. Gentleman's amendment, is the right way to tackle the problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) said that one cannot possibly separate religious and political considerations in Northern Ireland. If that were true, I would despair. I do not believe it to be true. I do not believe it has ever been true. It is not the case that either Nationalists or Unionists have been of one religious ilk or the other. The existence of the Alliance Party—I hold no brief whatever for that party—illustrates that people come together politically from different sides of what is called the religious divide. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman himself mentioned his colleague Mr. Ivan Cooper.<br><br>
One way to loosen the bond between political and religious affiliations to which he referred is for us all to recognise that discrimination of a kind which this Bill seeks to remedy is not, and has never been, in one direction only. Perhaps a contribution that can be made by elected representatives is to be ready to admit discrimination when it occurs in their own community rather than always to seek to allege it against the other.<br><br>
In intervening in the speech of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), the Minister of State cited the case of a law-abiding member of the Provisional Sinn Fein or a law-abiding member of the UDA. As he rightly said, these are legal organisations and the law-abiding members of such organisations would naturally have the protection of the Bill. On the other hand, members of the UDA or of the Provisional Sinn Fein might be anything but law-abiding. Presumably, however—I say this interrogatively—they would or could be the subject of Clause 42, which says:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"This Act shall not apply to an act done for the purpose of safeguarding national security or of protecting public safety or public order."</p></blockquote>
There is a procedure for a certificate to be signed,
<br><blockquote><p>"by or on behalf of the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the Minister of State would care to comment upon that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A person who may be a member of a lawful organisation but commits unlawful acts will not, of course, be protected by the Bill, and nobody would expect him to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman meant what he said, that the Bill would not come against discrimination against an individual member of such an organisation on the ground that he had formerly been engaged in unlawful activities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I said was correct. In effect, anyone who commits, or is known to have committed, an unlawful act will not be protected by the Bill. The discriminaiton clauses will not operate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the right hon. Gentleman say "known to have committed" as well?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. If, for example, an employer dismissed a person because he believed that that person had committed an unlawful act—whether he had been convicted of an unlawful act or not—and if that person appealed against dismissal on the grounds that he had not committed that act, the normal procedures would operate. There would, however, be no protection on the basis that he could claim support under the Bill if it was other than political or religious discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
I now turn to the amendment. In an earlier debate the right hon. Gentleman made it clear that in drafting the Bill he was not tied to the report and recommendations of the Working Party headed by my hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee). But
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0179">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
in this case, the Minister of State indicated that he is, in relation to the clause, giving legislative expression to the opinion of the Working Party in paragraph 6 of the report, which says that:
<br><blockquote><p>"'religious discrimination' should be taken to include discrimination on political grounds … because we recognise the close connection between politics and religion in Northern Ireland."</p></blockquote>
On the other hand, the Fair Employment Agency and the courts, whatever the intention of the right hon. Gentleman and the Government, must surely have regard to the plain English of the statute. So presumably discrimination on political grounds must include political discrimination against co-religionists—for example by an SDLP employer against a member of the Official or Provisional Sinn Fein, by a Vanguard Employer, adhering to the right hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig) against a member of the UUUC, or by a member of the United Ulster Unionist Movement against a member of the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I clear up that point by giving an affirmative answer? The answer is "Yes".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Biggs-Davison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have finished, Mr. Spence, I have had the answer to my question.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert J. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) appealed to us always to bear in mind the realities of the situation in Northern Ireland. But I do not believe that it is an evasion of reality to question the wisdom of attempting to deal in a statutory way with a complex matter, which, defies solution, by neat categorisation with the concept of discrimination on a religious basis.<br><br>
I am in complete agreement with my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell). I appeal for reality in the right hon. Gentlemen's understanding. I remind the Committee of some of the realities. We are entering a dimension which needs great clarification. As I have tried to say fairly and, I think,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
sensitively at our last Sitting, in the past there was much about the loyalty and the integrity of members of the minority community, but that questioning is no longer necessary. Happily, members of the minority community now contribute in a very important manner to the economic and commercial life of the Province—and we applaud that. But we must draw a clear distinction between the previous questioning of the loyalty and integrity of the members of the religious minority and the very valid questioning which still exists and must exist about the heads of members of a political community in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
There is no ambiguity about the declared goal of the Provisional Sinn Fein organisation. There is no ambivalence about its stance. Its declared aim is to destroy the economy of Northern Ireland to attaining its political goal. Therefore, it is valid to question the right of a member of such an organisation to be given employment, particularly where he could use the products of a particular firm for its Satanic goal and objectives. It will not do for Members on the Government benches to say that the Provisional Sinn Fein must be covered by the Bill.<br><br>
I remind the Committee of important words uttered by a former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who said that there were normally three objectives of enemies of the State—first, an attempt to destroy the forces of law and order; secondly, an attempt to destroy the credibility of the institutions of Government; and, thirdly, and perhaps most important, an attempt to destroy the economy. No one can doubt for a second that the Provisional Sinn Fein movement has embarked on all three courses. It stands condemned by its record. It has a catalogue of incidents and activities which would shame the most depraved member of any society, and yet we are told that, according to the terms of the Bill, such people are guarded should they seek to further their Satanic aims by applying for a particular job in a particular situation.<br><br>
There is implicit in the thinking of the right hon. Gentleman and some of his colleagues that the minority will always somehow orientate towards Republicanism or a non-Unionist stance. That is not only erroneous but it is counter-productive to the objective which they say they are aiming at in the Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0180">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
I stress to the right hon. Gentleman that it is damaging to keep alive something which could die a death, never to be resurrected again. I refer to the insatiable desire which the Bill will cherish and engender—the insatiable desire to assert and express the relative strength of one political grouping over another. I can think of nothing more damaging to the economy of Northern Ireland. I therefore appeal that Ministers do not give any safeguard or succour to people who would work for the destruction of the prosperous future which Northern Ireland will undoubtedly have if we can set aside this kind of legislation and work on the basis of common sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. Hon. Members are right in asserting that Clause 16 is important. The definition of political discrimination alongside religious discrimination is not an easy point to make within the terms of the Bill, and we have had illustrations during the debate of some of the issues and problems that can arise. However, I feel that the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), in making his case, got carried along the road so far that he was almost countenancing political discrimination as if that in itself were justifiable. I am sure that he does not believe that, and I am sure that he has never practised it.<br><br>
I gave instances of political discrimination that I have known. I am pleased to acknowledge that it is growing less in Great Britain, but it has arisen. In my reply to the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison), I made the point that if a person loses his job on the basis of not being a member of Vanguard as opposed to being an official Unionist, that is wrong. That is a form of discrimination.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman asks why we do not look at the United Kingdom as a whole. Why single out Northern Ireland? That is a valid question. As he knows, the Long Title of the Bill, which was discussed on the Floor of the House and in another place, talks of religious and political discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "And"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman probably notes also that in the 1973 Act
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
religious and political discrimination are outlawed or made unlawful in the public sector in Northern Ireland. As a Minister who has to operate two Ministries in Northern Ireland—there have been instances of local authorities being quoted in this Committee—I think that the lessening of discrimination in the public sector in Northern Ireland is an extremely important development. I assure the Committee that people who are employed, for example, in the Civil Service are employed on merit, and it has nothing to do with either their political or their religious affiliations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that include Communists?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, unless it is in a certain sector, people of lawful organisations are entitled to apply for jobs. I cannot speak for all sectors. I imagine that on security grounds there can be difficulties, but on the normal grounds it includes all people of lawful organisations. We talked earlier about Provisional Sinn Fein and the UDA, and I think the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) completely missed the argument. He went on to a "Second Reading" debate about Sinn Fein. The right hon. Gentleman went to great lengths to use this as an illustration, not to make a political point, and I can only take it that the hon. Gentleman misread the situation completely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is Provisional Sinn Fein a political philosophy? If so, is it safeguarded under the terms of the Bill? In answering that, the right hon. Gentleman will probably discover that, far from missing the point, I see it, and see the dangers implicit in this very loose and inadequate legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be drawn into such an argument because I was not using that type of argument. I was not in favour of Provisional Sinn Fein or the UDA or any other organisation. That is not relevant to this particular argument.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman posed the question whether hon. Members on this side—not least the Government—were trying to perpetuate with this Bill the division that exists within the two communities in Northern Ireland. Nothing could be further from our thoughts or our intentions in the Bill.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0181">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
We hope that, by eliminating discrimination based on religion or politics in Northern Ireland, we shall help to open up the scene. There are three Unionists present at the moment, and I am sure that, in a normal political situation, one of the hon. Members opposite would be sitting on this side of the Committee. I am looking at the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker). Where I would place the right hon. Gentleman is beyond me at the moment.<br><br>
It is the intention of the Bill that it would at this stage be unlawful to discriminate against a lawful organisation so long as it remains lawful. The right hon. Gentleman asked a question about the Communist Party in Northern Ireland, to which the answer is—Yes, it would be unlawful to discriminate against a person because he was a member of that party, other than on security grounds, because it is a lawful organisation within the State.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman asking us to accept that members of Provisional Sinn Fein, as exponents of a political philosophy, are lawful in the fullest sense of the word, when they have indulged in overt terrorism, have warned us that a certain number of members of Her Majesty's Forces will be returned in a particular kind of way—and then theirs is one organisation that has been denigrated by the Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland? Is he saying that in all those circumstances that organisation can and will be safeguarded by the terms of the Bill? If he is, it only proves our point.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying desperately hard to keep within the terms of the Bill. We had a hypothetical case—or perhaps positive case—cited by the hon. Gentleman's right hon. Friend. But what the hon. Member is asking me is whether the Provisional Sinn Fein should be lawful. That is the question he is posing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am dealing with lawful organisations and suddenly the hon. Member flies off in a flight of fancy, making a political argument which has nothing to do with this clause whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Political opinion."</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we are concerned about is religious and political discrimination as it arises in the Bill. I am trying desperately to get back to the central point of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not Clause 42 meet the hon. Gentleman's point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That deals with national security.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Public order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it necessarily deals with that point. I think the hon. Gentleman fully understands. If the right hon. Gentleman explained it to his hon. Friends they would be a little clearer about the matter.<br><br>
We are trying to conduct an argument based on a definition of political and religious discrimination. No one is contradicting the hon. Gentleman's arguments. He is entitled to make them if he believes them, but this is not the place to carry on that particular argument at this time.<br><br>
The van Straubenzee Report recognised that religious discrimination can sometimes clothe itself in the garb of political discrimination. If the Bill did not deal with that situation, employers could, without difficulty, evade its provisions by arguing that they had discriminated on grounds of a political opinion, not of religious belief. That is the central argument I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to draw the Minister back to the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford), but he cannot dodge them.<br><br>
He will remember, two years ago, legalising the Provisional Sinn Fein and, at the same time, the Ulster Volunteer Force. In that and a subsequent action, he has encapsulated our work because in a few months he had to re-proscribe the Ulster Volunteer Force. It was found by its actions, words and deeds, that the Government could no longer condone allowing that organisation to masquerade as a legitimate political organisation. It had a wing called the Volunteer Party and I presume that it was legalised in the hope that that would develop.<br><br>
We are here concerned about the protection being offered to the Provisional
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0182">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
Sinn Fein as a legitimate political organisation. It was interesting that the Minister said "at this time" and "so long as it is lawful". Does he anticipate that, like the Government of the Republic he may very soon have to declare it unlawful? It is interesting to note that whereas Brendan Magill could be excluded from Great Britain and for some time could tramp around Ireland preaching violent Republicanism as the full-time organiser of Provisional Sinn Fein, was he, only a fortnight ago, convicted in the High Court in Dublin for being a member of the IRA and is now serving a 12-month sentence.<br><br>
Anyone associated with Northern Ireland knows, that one cannot distinguish between Provisional Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA. I stood, not for the first time, in the centre of a town in my constituency of Armagh on Saturday morning and saw 20 business premises which had been blown out of business. I have seldom seen one bomb do so much damage. The shopping centre was destroyed. About 40, 50, or perhaps 60 people are unemployed today. Seamus Loughran described the mortar attack on Aldergrove Airport as an attack which epitomised the flair and imagination of the Provisional IRA. Is the Minister saying that if one of the apologists for that attack in Armagh went to one of those employers and asked for employment, and that employment was rejected on the basis that this man was a member of the Provisional Sinn Fein, the employer would be committing an illegal act under the terms of the Bill? Are we to believe that if such people subsequently seek employment from those whose business premises have been burnt and bombed, whose employees and relatives have been killed but are refused employment, the employer is committing an illegal act?<br><br>
I worked in a large concern in Craigavon with a member of the cashier's department. He was a decent chap who was in the office next to mine. Superficially I thought he was politically different from me; we argued the toss and lunched together. But one night that man drove in to the factory, backed his car up to the back gate, put £90,000 into his car and drove into the Republic to finance the activities of the IRA. Had I known that he was a member of the Provisional Sinn Fein and notified the employers they would either
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
have demoted him or fired him. That would have been illegal. Yet by not doing so, it cost the firm £90,000. We are now getting down to the nitty-gritty of this matter. I do not think the Minister can get away from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend are now really at home in deploying arguments which are absolutely outside the terms of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants to give examples, perhaps he can tell us about the number of UDA people recently convicted in the courts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be entirely in order for an employer to say to a UDA man "I will not employ you because of your membership of the UDA"? He would not necessarily be doing anything illegal under the terms of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the discrimination was on the grounds that he was a member of an organisation which is legal that would be unlawful under the terms of the Bill. We have repeatedly made this clear. The hon. Gentleman referred to what happened in this House. I did not do it, the House of Commons took a decision about lawful or unlawful organisations. We are dealing with the law as it is. His right hon. Friend could surely advise him of that. I understand his strength of feeling but it has nothing to do with the basic argument about lawful or unlawful organisations. I do not think that this is at the centre of the argument. We are dealing here with the unlawful discrimination that has taken place on a large scale against Roman Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. That is what we want to eradicate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about equal opportunity, not with quotas or balancing work-forces or anything of that nature, but with equal opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the sort of person to whom the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McClusker) referred would not be caught by Clause 42 can the Minister tell us who would be caught?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0183">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If they pose a threat to national security, they will be caught.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: "Public order" is also there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And public order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apprehend from that exchange that a fear which an employer might entertain rightly or wrongly, for the safety of his premises and the contents of his cash box, in relation to someone's religious or political affiliation, would not be protected by the words "public order" and "public safety" in Clause 42.<br><br>
I want to address myself to the major question. I have no desire to protract the proceedings but this is a matter of great importance and it is the duty of the Committee to be clear about what it is doing. I have the clear impression, after this debate, that the right hon. Gentleman's Bill has run away with him and I am not too sure that he knows that it has.<br><br>
Another question was raised about membership of the UDA. I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman has taken advice on whether—if I may use his favourite phrase—membership of the UDA is "political opinion"—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bradford</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>indicated dissent</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) expresses the opinion that it is not. I think that there could be differences and difficulties. That brings me back to the central point. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the Long Title. He referred to the purpose of the Bill which is, as he says, concerned with equality of opportunity. It is interesting that in Part II of the Bill, which defines equality of opportunity and deals with employers who do not afford such equality of opportunity, there is no mention of political opinion. Part II, with all its definitions and applications, is concerned only with religious belief. It is only when we come to this clause that for the first time—and this is mirrored in the Long Title—all political opinion is introduced.<br><br>
In time gone by—before we had this debate this morning—we all thought we understood why that was so and we thought that we agreed with the reason. We thought that the reason was that when we came to deal with individual cases of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
discrimination we did not want those who were discriminating on religious ground to escape by alleging political grounds for the discrimination. The Minister has, however, dispelled that illusion this morning. He has said "No, This is a Bill which breaks new ground in legislation, not merely new ground in outlawing religious discrimination and establishing the right to equality of opportunity as between persons of different religions. We are doing something here which is quite separate. We are in Part III dealing with political discrimination, untainted or untouched by religious opinions of beliefs".<br><br>
He spoke of a case of discrimination between two non-subscribing Presbyterians—Let us be precise, because there is such a thing, which either Gladstone or Morey called the "dissidence of dissent"—however injudicious that reflection may be. The Minister says that if we can find am example of discrimination on political grounds—UPNI versus UUU—between two non-subscribing Presbyterians, that is not merely covered by the Bill but is intended by the Bill. He says "I am bringing in a Bill now which deals with political discrimination where there is no religious overtone whatsoever". That is the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the position that it was not intended to be covered by the Bill but that it is covered by the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. My hon. Friends and I are giving reasons why it should not be covered. I think that we all came to the Committee under the impression that the reason for the appearance of these words at this point was to avoid—as the van Straubenzee report said—creating loopholes for covert religious discriminattion. If the right hon. Gentleman will do that, then my hon Friends and I will support it. We should not support him, and I should be surprised if other members of the Committee supported him if he were suddenly to say "And I intend also to deal with political discrimination, discrimination between sects in political parties, with discrimination between Vanguard and Official Unionists, where there is no taint, possibility or suspicion that religion enters into it".<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
As so often is the case, the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) was my ally in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0184">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
demonstrating this. He pointed out that there may well be prejudice on the part of a Protestant employer against a member of his party, although that employer may have known that the colleague whom the hon. Member mentioned was, and remained, a Protestant. So there is no doubt, and we are clear. The right hon. Gentleman may complain that it has taken us some time to get it clear, but it was surprising to many of us that it was worth the trouble to get it clear.<br><br>
Now, why is this wrong, and why should we exclude political opinion except in so far as it could be the shield or loophole for what is virtually discrimination? The answer is that the question of dealing with political discrimination has not been professed as the reason for this Bill. It has not been considered on those grounds. It has not entered into previous debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are only following along the path already laid by the 1973 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 1973 Act deals with public employment, and the right hon. Gentleman must not say that that which is right and proper for the public service must automatically be compulsory for private employers. He must not say, without case made, that because it is right that the Civil Service should not discriminate on grounds of political opinion, therefore he will bring into this Bill, for Northern Ireland alone, a provision which makes it in private employment unlawful to discriminate on grounds of political opinion.<br><br>
I offer—as at present advised, because we are ignorant in this matter—no view on what position my hon. Friends and I might take towards such legislation proposed, for instance, for the United Kingdom. There is no doubt that in parts of Great Britain there is strong prejudice in some employment against those who hold certain political opinions. There is no doubt that in many employments an applicant known to be in favour of nationalisation, to be in favour of Socialism—or vice versa—would be at a disadvantage. If we must embark upon a new area of anti-discrimination legislation—legislation against discrimination on political grounds uncontaminated by religious opinions—we must first know that, and second, we must consider the matter
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
<i>ab initio</i> and in the context of the United Kingdom as a whole. It is not right that this new field should be opened up in Northern Ireland as a side-wind of legislation aimed at religious discrimination.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman looks forward, as I do, to the emergence in Northern Ireland of alignment with the political parties in Great Britain. I do so heartily. I believe that the deliberate linking of differences of political opinion in this legislation with the religious divide—we are, in effect, saying that in the circumstances of Northern Ireland one must treat all politics as if it were an adjunct of religion—will make more difficult the objective which the right hon. Gentleman and I devoutly hope will be brought nearer.<br><br>
I put this proposition to the right hon. Gentleman. There is in interpretation the means whereby words can be so placed that they take their colour from the context. The rule which elsewhere is called the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule, means that the phrase "ducks and other birds" in a statute does not necessarily include eagles and vultures. The interpretation of "other birds" takes its colour from the leading word "ducks".<br><br>
If the right hon. Gentleman could contrive to bring political opinion into the Bill so that it takes its colour and interpretation, application and administration from its underlying purpose, from the basic concept of discrimination on religious grounds, not only would I beg leave to withdraw the amendment so that he could give the possiblility further thought but I would say to him that he was thereby greatly favouring the success of what he intends in the legislation, and that he was going the right way about promoting the sort of political future which he and I want to see in that part of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I conclude by begging the right hon. Gentleman to insist on deliberately insulating "political opinion" as a new and different topic from the rest of the Bill. He will find that by so doing he is raising probably not one but many hornets' nests in its application. I ask him to put that expression back into the context of the Bill as a whole, and to find the legal and statutory means—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Max Madden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said that it was within his

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 331</span>
knowledge that believers in nationalisation and Socialism might be treated in a disadvantageous way by employers within the United Kingdom as a whole. Could he tell us which sectors of private enterprise within the United Kingdom treat potential applicants in that way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that if an employer in an area threatened with nationalisation was confronted with two prospective employees, one of whom was a known advocate of the nationalisation of that firm among others, that person would fare less well in selection compared with somebody who was a known advocate of and believer in the private enterprise system. But I form no view on what I happen to believe was the legislation placed before the House. I find it very difficult to imagine that such political views, intentions and attitudes on the part of an applicant for a job are irrelevant to his suitability for a job.<br><br>
I was not thinking of what we suppose is the old style, when landlords evicted tenants who did not vote for their candidate. I was thinking more of the fact that the very atmosphere in this country—certainly within some industries and some areas—is permeated by political difference. It is common knowledge that it is bound favourably or otherwise to influence the prospects of individuals in certain employments. I certainly was not conscious of announcing anything which would be in the least degree surprising or out of line with people's experience.<br><br>
I am sorry that I was diverted just as I was closing. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman has seized the major point which is being put to him. I am sure that he has. I put it to him not wishing to wreck his Bill but wishing to eliminate from it elements which could bring about its failure—a failure which in some respects my hon. Friends and I fear, but which could make that failure more likely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the argument fully. As I explained to the Committee, the purpose of the clause is to show that religious discrimination under the guise of political discrimination is wrong, and one should obviously catch the other. But the Bill also deals with political discrimination in its own right in this definition. I am sure that neither my hon. Friends nor the Opposition would be opposed to that. I am
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
amazed at the strength of the argument that the right hon. Gentleman has made, as it were, in defence. He said "It is all right not to discriminate in the public sector, but it is quite in order to discriminate in the private sector". That is the sort of argument that my hon. Friends find it very difficult to countenance or to follow.<br><br>
There will not necessarily be a great number of cases under the clause. But discrimination between members of the SDLP and the Alliance Party, or between UPNI members and Ulster Unionists, on the basis of their political affiliation, will be caught by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman explain why the Bill does not seek to promote equality of opportunity between persons of different political opinions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have gone through the earlier part of the Bill where we dealt with religious discrimination. We have dealt with equal opportunity. What we are dealing with now is discrimination, either religious or political. We have had a full debate on this matter.<br><br>
I think that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that the Government have listened to arguments and are trying to take into account the feelings of the Committee. We do not believe that one can legislate merely for the sake of legislation in the sense that that will automatically put the matter right. We have to carry the people of Northern Ireland with us, backed by a Bill containing a clause like this and other clauses. But, at the end of the day, however reluctantly, we must carry the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends on the basis that this is the law. It must be seen to be fair and it must be fairly operated.<br><br>
I have tried to give an interpretation to the Committee. I do not see this or any other Government being able to use a sledgehammer to impose this sort of legislation. It must be argued out. People must see that it is wrong to discriminate and that the law says that it is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could my right hon. Friend deal with the question, in relation to this clause in particular, whether there might be circumstances in which private prosecutions could be brought, or whether there is always an opportunity to exercise some limited discretion as to how the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0186">Image</span>

powers to deal with unlawful matters are to be used?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not envisaged that private prosecutions can be brought. Perhaps I may deal with that more fully on "Clause stand part", but the straight answer is "No".<br><br>
Having outlined again the philosophy of this matter and how it should be implemented, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fitt</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is obvious that we shall not complete consideration of the clause this morning. My right hon. Friend has told the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) that in other circumstances he might find himself on this side of the Committee. I have serious doubts about that, because if that had been so, the hon. Member would have had an opportunity of being a member of the Northern Ireland Labour Party in the context of Northern Ireland politics. I do not envisage the time when there would be such a dramatic conversion.<br><br>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 40, in page 12, line 39, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'due allowance being made for any material difference in their suitability'.</p></blockquote>
The qualification proposed in the amendment is, after all, included in Clause 3 dealing with equality of opportunity, and it is not clear to us why the same qualifications have not been included here.<br><br>
The Minister of State said in the last debate—and we all approved—that this legislation should be seen to be fair, should be fairly operated and should carry with it hon. Members representing Northern Ireland constituencies. It will be essential
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
accept as an employee someone who had been a member of the Provisional Sinn Fein, which is a lawful organisation. The same conditions apply to members of the UDA, who have carried out just as many illegal acts and more heinous crimes then members of the IRA. They have been involved in some very brutal crimes. There are employers in Northern Ireland who would not wish to employ members of either the Sinn Fein or the UDA.<br><br>
12.45 p.m.<br><br>
But what if we were to listen to the advocacy of those two Members? What does it mean? I am not certain of the membership of either the UDA or the Provisional Sinn Fein but it must run into thousands. They are saying that members of such organisations should not be afforded any protection whatsoever in seeking employment in Northern Ireland. That would mean saying to thousands of people who make up the work-force in Northern Ireland "You will not be given the protection of this Bill. Therefore, you will never get a job". That is a ridiculous position.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 3, Noes 9.</p>
<p>to enlist the co-operation of employers if the Bill is to achieve anything. It is our view that the words proposed in the amendment will be some reassurance to employers that they will not be expected to subordinate the practical requirements of their business, the efficiency of a plant, or indeed, the requirements of equity to numerical considerations which might be tantamount to the quotas to which the working party was opposed and to which we here are all opposed.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the terms in which the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr.Biggs-Davison) moved the amendment, but under the subsection (2) a person is said to discriminate against another if he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0187">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
treats him, on the ground of religious belief or political opinion:
<br><blockquote><p>"less favourably in any circumstances than he would treat any other person in those circumstances."</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to add:
<br><blockquote><p>"due allowance being made for any material difference in their suitability"</p></blockquote>
so as to make it clear that account can be taken of whether one person is more suitable than another. But the Bill already achieves this result. The fact that the clause is couched in positive terms of discrimination on grounds:
<br><blockquote><p>"of religious belief or political opinion"</p></blockquote>
implies the negative proposition, that less favourable treatment on other grounds—that is because there is a difference in the suitability of persons concerned—does not constitute unlawful discrimination for the purposes of the Bill. The amendment is, therefore, inappropriate in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would be surprised if the right hon. Gentleman fully understood the argument in his brief. He did not give the impression that he was convinced by it, at any rate, and I am not surprised because I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will have Clause 3 in front of him, which is the definition of equality of opportunity. I do not see how equality of opportunity fails to import the idea of:
<br><blockquote><p>"due allowance being made for any material difference in their suitability"</p></blockquote>
whereas the idea of discrimination does import such a notion. In other words, if it was necessary and desirable to qualify the definition in Clause 3(2) with the phrase "due allowance" and so on, surely it must be necessary to qualify "those circumstances" in the same way in Clause 16(2). It seems an immensely subtle idea that discriminating against a person on the ground of religious belief is different from denying him equality of opportunity as against another person of a different religious belief, which is the point of Clause 3(2).<br><br>
I hope, now that the official Opposition has hit on a really valid improvement to the Bill, that the right hon. Gentleman will not be churlish. He should encourage them. Even if there is something slightly superfluous in adding these words, the Committee has added Clause 3 to the Bill with this phrase in it. It is not as though that phrase in Clause 3 went without any
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
debate. There was considerable debate at the time. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be generous to the official Opposition and allow to them that, if these words do not stand here, it will create a presumption, at any rate in some unsubtle minds, that "due allowance for suitability" will not be permitted in Clause 16—being specifically mentioned in Clause 3 but not there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the terms, and I thought that the reference I read out clearly answered the hon. Gentleman's point. In Clause 3 "equality of opportunity" means the same opportunity so that must be qualified by referring to suitability.<br><br>
Let me give an example. For instance, a job needs men 6ft tall and above. An employer would be able to discriminate if a man of 5ft lin applied for the job. So a real opportunity of doing this sort of thing has been made. I hope that it meets the argument of the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison). He moved his amendment very succinctly and I tried to give him a succinct reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The phrase in question is:
<br><blockquote><p>"treats that … person less favourable."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words which are being qualified, not the word "discriminates". Subsection (2) is a definition of discrimination, and the crucial definition of discrimination is to treat "less favourably". It does not seem to me that "less favourably" is in less need of qualification than is the notion of opportunity. Both favour and opportunity admittedly can be qualified by aptitude or otherwise. Since the aptitude was specifically mentioned in the context of opportunity in Clause 3(2), I think that it ought to be specifically mentioned in the context of favour or otherwise in Clause 16(2).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Orme</span><span class='membercontribution'>: if the right hon. Gentleman looks at the words
<br><blockquote><p>"if, on either of those grounds"</p></blockquote>
he will see that this meets his point.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 98, in page 13, line 8, leave out subsection (c).<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0188">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
If you please, Mr. Spence, I think it would be convenient if we could look at the next two amendments together since some of us are puzzled by the appropriateness of what is contained in those two paragraphs and the last three lines of the subsection. I refer to Amendment No. 99, in page 13, line 11, leave out subsection (<i>d</i>) and Amendment No. 100, in page 13, leave out lines 13 to 15.<br><br>
Of course (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) go without saying. Clearly, a person who makes a complaint and clearly a person who gives evidence or information ought to be protected against victimisation as a consequence. The question is whether we ought to extend the nature of protection against victimisation to the remaining items. I take them in order.<br><br>
The first is allegation that X has contravened the Act. I wonder whether it is right to deal on the same basis as making a complaint or giving evidence or information with an assertion which might be made, and which, might reach the employer, that such-and-such a person has said "You know so-and-so, I would not care to bring his behaviour into comparison with the terms of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976."<br><br>
There are other ways in which, properly, under the law, that kind of statement ought to be dealt with. Clearly, there is a remedy,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
by way of process for defamation, against a person who alleges that such-and-such a person has contravened this measure or behaved in a way which is unlawful under it.<br><br>
But is it right that the measure shall protect against victimisation a person whose offence, if it is an offence, is to have said or done something which is actionable? This seems to be confusing two types of remedy and two types of situation. We are not in paragraph (<i>c</i>) protecting the person who claims his right under the Bill. By all means let us do that, but I do not see why we should protect a person who lays himself open to an action for defamation.<br><br>
Paragraph (<i>d</i>) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"otherwise done anything under or by reference to this Act in relation to him or any other person,"</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that that is impossibly wide since there are many things which one might do under the Bill which are of a positive character. Certainly, I should like to know, before forming an opinion, what other kinds of action, under this Bill, besides making a complaint—</span></p>
