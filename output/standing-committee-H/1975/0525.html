<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>PARLIAMENTARY AND OTHER PENSIONS AND SALARIES BILL</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Parliamentary and other Pensions and Salaries Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[<i>Mr. Charles R. Morris.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before calling the first amendment I should remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill. Copies are in the Room.<br><br>
Adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call manuscript amendments. As hon. Members will have seen from the Notice Paper, all the amendments are starred, but there was little time for Members to put down amendments. They have all received careful consideration.</span></p>

Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
MEMBER'S PENSIONABLE SALARY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Rathbone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 5, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'except that no such higher rate shall be specified in respect of an actual salary arrived at by a salary increase in excess of any Government wage restraint scheme (statutory or voluntary) then being applied'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we can discuss the following:Amendment No. 5, page 2, line 18, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(5) This section shall only apply to Members who retire or die on or before the dissolution of the present Parliament'.</p></blockquote>
New Clause 1 (<i>Act not to apply to Members' salaries after increase</i>)
<br><blockquote><p>'Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, if at any time the salaries of Members of Parliament are, in conformity with any wages and salaries policy of Her Majesty's Government then in force, increased to a higher vote than those paid on the posting of this Act, then the new rate of salary shall be a Member's pensionable salary for all purposes.'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rathbone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason for this amendment harks back to the moment when the announcement was made of the increase in parliamentary salaries, which was four days before the announcement of the Government's extended wage restriction scheme which is now in operation or which is about to come into operation. It was at about that time that the Government saw fit to raise Members' salaries to £5,750, and that was in contrast both ways. Firstly it was in contrast to the £8,000 which was recommended by the Boyle Committee, and secondly it was in contrast to the £6 a week maximum wage increase which was to be announced four days subsequently. It is for this reason that I have suggested this amendment so that the rate presently in the clause,
<br><blockquote><p>"a Member's yearly salary at the rate specified in the resolution"</p></blockquote>
will be limited by any guidelines established at this moment or in the future by the Government for wage and salary increases throughout the country.<br><br>
The reasons for this are that we—in the House of Commons—would be seen to be doing to ourselves what we are asking the rest of the people—voluntarily at the moment but with the threat of statutory limitations hanging in the wings—to do to themselves. It is unfortunate that running through this whole Bill there is an unspecified, albeit omnipresent, self-servingness about establishing a method of pensions which is unique to the Members and officers who are mentioned in the Bill. It is so that we can ask people to do as we do rather than do as we say that I move this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Sir Stephen, for selecting with the amendment which has been moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Rathbone) Amendment No. 5, which is in my name. This is an attempt at a compromise following the House's acceptance of this Bill on Second Reading.<br><br>
I find myself in the difficult position of serving on two Standing Committees this morning. Both are sitting at the same time. I hope that you and other Members of the Committee will forgive me if I am unable to stay here very long. I have not yet mastered the art of being in two places at once or making two speeches at once on different subjects.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0524">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the word "retire" in my hon. Friend's amendment include moving from one Standing Committee to another?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that did not occur to me but I do not have the benefit of my hon. and legal Friend's legal education.<br><br>
During the Second Reading debate on 29th April I moved a reasoned amendment because I felt that this Bill gives to hon. Members a privileged pension position which is denied to the rest of the community. At that time I expressed the hope that the restrictions on pensions rates would be removed in stage 2 of the pay policy, thus making this Bill more acceptable. I am not against the Bill itself. It seems to me that in times of pensions restrictions there is much to be said for trying to work out arrangements so that those people who retire during the period of restrictions do not suffer. If this principle is right for hon. Members it is right for the rest of the community. If it is wrong for hon. Members it is wrong for the rest of the community. Stage 2 of the pay policy has now been announced. I regret that the Government have not seen their way to removing the restrictions on pension benefits.<br><br>
We therefore have this invidious distinction, that at the vey moment when the Government are trying to sell stage 2, including a near freeze on pension improvements, this Bill gives substantial improvements on pension rights for hon. Members. I suggest to the Government, if they intend to administer medicine to the rest of the community, that that medicine should also be taken by Mnisters and hon. Members as well.<br><br>
It cannot, in my judgment, be argued that the proposals in this clause fall within the exceptions allowed under the pay policy. The Minister tried to argue that on Second Reading. It is only possible to do the equivalent of what this Bill does if an agreement was made before 11th July 1975, the publication date of the White Paper on the pay restrictions, but the resolution of the House agreeing these proposals was not passed until 22nd July. So I submit that the proposals here are outside the clear deadline laid down.<br><br>
It could be argued that hon. Members ought to have better pay. I agree: it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
absolutely correct. We ought to have faced this openly a long time ago. The fact is that we have not, and what we are now resorting to is what I can only regard as a pensions dodge which is denied to others.<br><br>
We have to be extremely careful about how we proceed in this area for two very good reasons. The first is that we have the power, denied to pretty well any other section of the community, of fixing our own pay and pension arrangements. Having this power, surely it is an obligation upon us to see that we exercise it with great restraint, and show an example to the rest of the community. The other thing which is important is that, although it may be said that our pension arrangements are still nothing like as good as they should be, the fact is that they have been substantially improved over recent years and we now have the benefit of inflation-proof provisions along with the public services generally. They are worth a great deal in these days of high inflation and are arrangements which are denied to many people in the private sector because their schemes are not able to provide the guarantees which are provided for us.<br><br>
In my amendment I have suggested a slightly different compromise to that proposed by my hon. Friend. I recognise that the Bill has had a Second Reading and, therefore, one ought to try to find some middle way. I recognise that during pay restrictions the hardest case is nearly always that of those who retire while restrictions are on. If the final salary is held down, then in any scheme based on the final salary the pension is held down, too, and this can last for the rest of the pensioner's life. He can suffer for evermore, whereas those still in work have at least an opportunity to catch up when the pay restrictions are removed. I have, therefore, tried in this amendment to identify this group and have suggested that it would be appropriate for hon. Members who die—and whose widows or other dependants would be entitled to some benefit under the pension schemes—or who retire before or on the dissolution of Parliament to be in a special position and that it should be possible for their pensions to be calculated on a notional pay basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman explain in what way any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0525">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
other hon. Member is affected by the present arrangements? Surely it will only be hon. Members who retire during the present Parliament or before the restrictions are raised who will suffer? Other Members when they retire will have a pension calculated upon whatever is the salary at that time, and the only effect will be that the Treasury, and perhaps hon. Members personally, will have to chip in increased pension contributions to allow these increased pensions to be paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Member's argument he is giving me my point. He is really saying that there is no need for this Bill at all, no need for the special arrangements, except perhaps for those who, unhappily, die in the immediate future, or who retire while the restrictions are still on. I think that is the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important point and we should get it clear. In what way is any other Member going to derive, as the hon. Member thinks, unfair advantage created by the legislation as it stands now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the answer to that is that once there is established in legislation the concept that pension rights be based on notional pay—which is, in this case, substantially higher than actual pay—it will be very difficult for Parliament to reverse that. In other words, we would be establishing a privileged position which, I believe, would be reflected in all future pension arrangements for hon. Members.<br><br>
I was saying that the hardest cases will come among those who die in the immediate future or who retire while the restrictions are still on. For this reason I have suggested, and I hope that I am being helpful, a compromise—that we should allow these privileged arrangements for hon. Members in that category. For the rest, those who will be here thereafter, an objectionable principle enshrined in this Bill, and it is, above all, one which we deny to the rest of the community.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eric Ogden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean) is arguing that there should be two classes of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Members of Parliament. There are already more than a dozen classes of Members of Parliament, so that does not worry me too much, but there would be different groups: one group of Members whose pay and pensions were slightly different from those of another group. That would add complication to complication. We are stuck with the result of a wrong decision made not only by the Government but by the House of Commons last July. The consequences of that arose eight or nine months later. This proposal would make the position even more complicated, because there would be two different classes—those whose salaries and pensions were based on one set of values, and those whose salaries and pensions were based on another set, even though the difference would be entirely notional and even though the practical effect would be a long way off.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and I understand his point, but would he not accept that there are already a number of categories of Members and retired Members of Parliament? Following the Second Reading debate I had a letter from a former Member of this House who retired some time ago and he has no pension whatsoever. He retired before the pension arrangements were introduced and he was very bitter about that. The essence of his letter was "Here are you, the present generation of Members of Parliament, not only giving yourselves pensions but basing them on notional pay, whereas I get no pension whatsoever". So there are already a number of categories of Members and retired Members for pension purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ogden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely, and it is a disgraceful situation. It contrasts with what some people say, that we are providing ourselves with benefits over and above those for the community, when in the past Members denied themselves. But, it proves that, instead of the ridiculous process of trying to argue with a shadow employer about pensions and salaries, we should have some kind of negotiating machinery for getting this matter out of the way, and the House has suggested how it might be done.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues are rightly concerned that those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0526">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
outside the House are saying that we are putting ourselves into a privileged position. If the hon. Member for Somerset, North can stay—I am grateful to him for coming back—I may ease his mind by telling him that over the last four weekends I have been away in various parts of the country talking to my mining colleagues. We have a certain problem to resolve in the NUM and it is being resolved in a proper way, by talking to people, letting them make up their own minds and putting their X on the ballot paper. No one, among the many hundreds of people I have met, has said "We are going to claim our £100, because you are fixing your own pensions." The question of Members' salaries and pensions has not arisen at all with the militants of Yorkshire, South Wales, Scotland or anywhere else. So the hon. Gentleman might bear in mind that not everybody is as concerned as he appears to think.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in the difficulty that I agree with so much of what has been said by my two hon. Friends as to their reasons for proposing these amendments but disagree with the conclusions which they have reached.<br><br>
This Bill arises from the absurd decision to implement only a small part of the recommendations of the Boyle Committee. This is due to a form of cowardice. We are always scared about the pay or pensions of Members of Parliament or Ministers, and have been for a very long time. Apart from using our power to fix our own remuneration in a way which would excite the envy or humility of the community, we have been so worried that we have used it very greatly to our disadvantage. So that is the background.<br><br>
I suggest that the amendments proposed would not be very valuable. With regard to No. 2, proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Rathbone) I cannot imagine any occasion when the House would award itself a remuneration higher than that allowed by some pay policy. It will always do the opposite, and we shall always lag behind. So I do not think the amendment would alter anything very much.<br><br>
I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean), who has had to leave us, may not have thought his amendment through. Of course, we need this Bill in general. Its effect is not to authorise the pension
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
on which we have decided: that was done by the Supply Vote in the House. The purpose of the Bill is to make sure that Members are not charged income tax on the contributions which they make over and above what is authorised by the existing Income Tax Acts. It would produce a very strange situation if my hon. Friend's amendment were accepted, because there would be two categories of Members of Parliament—those who were paying income tax on that part of their contributions which was greater than the permitted amount for the actual salary paid, and those who were not. But nobody would ever know, because who would know who would die or retire before the end of the present Parliament? It would be a most extraordinary situation and I do not know how it would be resolved. I suppose we would all be charged the extra and then, if we had not died or retired before the end of the Parliament, it would be paid back to us. It is a fascinating suggestion, and it has a kind of beauty about it that I do not want to stand in the way of, but I do not think it makes a great deal of sense.<br><br>
We have got ourselves into a rather silly and embarrassing position, and we had better get through it as quickly as possible. If we want to avoid embarrassments like this in the future, the method is very simple. We should not leave parliamentary remuneration business unresolved for four years, do it retrospectively over a period of about four years. and then take fright because we know that the Press are not very good at dividing a sum by four or three and three-quarters, or whatever it is, and are quite incapable of comprehending the point about compound interest for delay. They always think that if people wait 20 years and are then given an increase, they are just as well off as if they had had it year by year. All these things are beyond the comprehension of certain columnists in certain newpapers and, therefore, the House gets alarmed and does itself badly.<br><br>
We have got ourselves into a ridiculous position, but I see no reason why we should made it much more ridiculous by being so concerned about pensions. I am sorry that all this fuss is being made, because inevitably, quite soon, there will come the second part of the Boyle Report. So are we not stirring it all up, just as Lord Boyle is about to recommend some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0527">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
sensible readjustment of the pension scheme?<br><br>
If there is anything which really surpasses the bounds of absurdity in this matter it is the idea that Members of Parliament should have to serve 40 years before getting a pension. It means that one has to enter the House at the age of 25, and stay here without a break till the age of 65. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the hon. Member wish to interrupt me?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I heard the hon. and learned Gentleman correctly. He said that a Member would have to serve that number of years before receiving a pension. But a Member receives a pension after having served four years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I should have said the full pension of two-thirds. Before receiving the two-thirds of salary, a Member has to serve in the House for 40 years. Nobody does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am quite sure that we shall make progress much faster if we do not have sedentary interruptions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree that what I have said is right.<br><br>
Therefore, a Member would have to enter the House at 25 years of age and not be defeated in an election till he was 65. That is totally unrealistic in relation to the membership of Parliament, and one therefore assumes that a change is about to be suggested.<br><br>
This kind of amendment, well meant as it is, and this kind of debate and all the fuss that there has been, will make it doubly difficult for that kind of improvement to be proposed. Therefore, I venture to hope that we may make as little fuss as possible about this Bill. None of us can possibly like it, but it is absolutely unavoidable at this time and, I should have thought, virtually un-amendable. We either do it or we do not. Therefore, I hope that the Government will not accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First I want to say that I am a Member of the Parliamentary Pension Fund, and I am astounded when amendments like this are put down. Having served 25 years
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
in the House I have heard so much humbug at times from the other side, and I could tell some interesting stories. I was not surprised when the hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean) spoke of his ex-Member friend who is in bad circumstances. I myself have been surprised over the last two years at the amount of poverty among some of the retired former Conservative Members, and that is a great problem which must be cleared up as quickly as possible.<br><br>
These amendments are the wrong way round. It is not a question of giving something for nothing. Also, we must bear in mind that when the salary of £8,000 was recommended by Boyle, it was only to give the purchasing power that we had in 1964, although all the other professions and classes of workers received their increases year by year.<br><br>
As has been pointed out by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Bell), judges' pensions are calculated on twenty-fifths. Members of Parliament are a special case, and I have said that they should get not sixtieths but fortieths, if one considers the kind of pensions paid in Western Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. There has not been as much humbug there as we have had over the last 40 years, and their pensions are adjusted automatically.<br><br>
It would have been far better if the salary had been paid and pensions had been given accordingly. Did we not make a great sacrifice? Here we are—stuck; and we know that there can be no major increase in salaries, possibly till the distant future, and anyone who opposes the Bill as it stands is doing a grave injustice. I have heard all the arguments, and I know that you, Sir Stephen, also have. We are beginning to realise, at last, that it is time things were put straight, and the sooner we do it the better for all of us. I was hoping that we would deal with this business expeditiously, because it needs to be done. I do not know whether I am in order in saying why, but it is creating some problems for those running our parliamentary pensions scheme. We have to get the matter cleared up as quickly as possible.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
I shall not argue against the amendment because I have heard so much, and so

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
have others, about this. I am not prepared to be difficult about it, but I feel we should deal with the Bill. It may be not entirely as we want it but, bearing in mind that the argument so far has been put the wrong way round and that we already have suffered and will continue to suffer for a good number of years, the people we should be thinking about are those who already have given 30 to 40 years of service, like Lord Shinwell who served for something approaching 40 years, I believe.<br><br>
How many hon. Members will serve 40 years when they come here after winning marginal seats? They are in and out, and their families suffer. The sooner we can put the matter of salary and pension right the better for all. We should put a stop to the bandying about of our privileges. Responsibility should be taken off the shoulders of parliamentarians. To some extent we have done it.<br><br>
If it had been unpopular, the Boyle Report would not have been accepted. It has been suggested by experts, by men who have made full investigations. They having done that and it is incumbent upon us to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. R. A. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There can be no doubt that the whole question of Members' pay and pensions is a mess. It is a mess now and is being made little better by this Bill. It will continue to be a mess unless and until the public recognises that it will sooner or later have to pay its Members of Parliament in accordance with the way parliamentarians are paid in other countries and unless and until the Government of whatever political complexion have the courage to grasp the nettle of the Boyle Report of last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dan Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not encourage any hon. Member to describe M.P.'s salaries as a mess and a continuing mess. One of the most respected of parliamentarians is the man responsible for the arrangement, Lord Boyle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was only just beginning to work out my preamble and if the hon. Member does not mind I will omit to answer his point directly and come back unashamedly to say that the situation is a mess and remains one, and that the Bill does nothing to alter that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
In our attempt to try to be decent to certain more elderly colleagues we are being accused in the public Press and elsewhere of engaging in a dodge which somehow makes life much easier for us and more difficult for those we represent. We are assured by the Government that this Bill is a temporary palliative to a situation which we all recognise is difficult. In politics there is nothing so permanent as the temporary, and I see the situation stretching forward into the future if we allow the Bill to pass entirely unamended, or let the commentators who see it as a dodge get away with saying that, or let the Bill push the Boyle Report into the background, and, by simply taking care of the difficult cases, suppose the more important issues of the Boyle Report can somehow be forgotten.<br><br>
Whatever we say about these amendments we should recognise that this Bill and the principle, if that is the right word, enshrined in it, can only be seen as a stop-gap measure as an attempt to benefit our colleagues who are in more acute difficulties than some of the rest of us. There is an abiding need for the House of Commons and the country to see what a Member of Parliament is worth in 1976. There is a need to assess our value by comparison with parliamentarians in other countries in Europe, the United States and elsewhere and not least in some of the so-called emergent countries. Only when we have analysed these matters thoroughly and seriously shall we be able to come to anything approaching a permanent solution.<br><br>
It irks rather to find a public commentator with a part-time Government-sponsored appointment on the Totalisator Board which pays £8,000 a year being one of the principal critics of what we are trying to do. This is ill-informed comment and humbug in the extreme, and I hope that our message will get through<br><br>
I am a little inclined to recommend the Minister to accept Amendment No. 5 because, while I accepted many points in the interjection of the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham), if we can be seen to be wearing belt and braces in this matter, and dealing with it only on a partial and temporary basis, only for our more elderly colleagues, that will emphasise the necessity of looking at the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0529">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
whole of hon. Members' pay and pensions. I hope the Minister will look more sympathetically at Amendment No. 5 than at some of the others. I hope he will tell us whether it would improve the Bill and underline its temporary nature. If he questions that I hope he will accept—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rathbone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point underlying New Clause 1 specifically meets my hon. Friend's point in underlining the temporary nature of the Bill. From the moment MPs' salaries are increased this notional basis disappears and the actual salary is substituted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did my hon. Friend an injustice in concentrating on Amendment 5 when I should have said that New Clause 1 and Amendment 5 are related to the basic principle I am putting.<br><br>
We should underline the temporary nature of what we are doing, and not give the impression that we are somehow engaging in a marvellous job to our advantage and that there is no need to turn back to the Boyle Report, or on to future Boyle reports.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New Clause 1 would mean, under present-day policies, that if a moderate increase in salary were made this year or next, that slightly increased figure would become the pensionable figure, and not the notional figure of £8,000 a year which we have at present. Whatever the complications of an interim stage and may be five interim stages—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rathbone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the concept in the new clause, although I am more optimistic of the future, a future when no Government ceiling will be applied to wages and salaries. I hope that will come sooner than the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) thinks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That optimism may or may not be justified, but my pessimism is justified in the present situation in believing that they will not be put up to £8,000 for a considerable time.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) said two things which I firmly disagree. The first was "The public have to recognise that hon. Members must be paid properly". He seemed to be shifting the onus in this matter from us, who have it and cannot
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
avoid it, on to the public, as if to say to the public "Start paying MPs on the basis and everything in the garden will be lovely". He then said that the Government should do the right thing, that they should have the courage to accept the Boyle Report.<br><br>
It is nothing to do with the Government. If this were a self-respecting legislature there would not be a Government Minister here in the Committee. It is only because we are a decadent establishment that we leave this matter so much in the hands of the Government. It is the job of hon. Members to decide everything, but particularly this matter of the remuneration of MPs. How can a Member of Parliament say that he is doing his job of checking the Executive when we allow ourselves, our own remuneration, to be controlled by the people we are supposed to be controlling? This is a nonsense.<br><br>
Last year I moved an amendment to the motion to change the rate of salary from £5,750 to £6,300. There was a sort of justification for that figure. It would have meant we were taking roughly half the increase recommended by Boyle. I also justified it on more involved grounds, which I shall not go over again. There was so little support for my modest proposal that it was not worth taking it to a vote. We should recognise where the blame lies, because we have not got the guts to recognise what has to be done. The sooner 318 hon. Members have enough guts to do this the sooner it will be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ogden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: 315 hon. Members will accept what the 318 have decided.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dissent slightly from the remarks on both sides implying that our pension arrangements at present are less generous than they should be. Looking at the pension scheme by comparison with schemes outside, taking them in general and not looking at the judges, who are over-generously treated in all sorts of ways, our pension scheme stands up to comparison. There is a basis of one-sixtieth of final salary inflation proofed for each year of service. That is not less generous than is common outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to make comparisons because of the strange
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0530">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
career structure of Members of Parliament. One cannot compare our pensions with those of people who enter their profession from school or university for 40 or 50 years of work. The judges get one twenty-fifth because they are in their 50s before they go on the bench and were in practice before that.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. We have a system where people can shift from job to job and not suffer loss in pension. We have been trying to get transferability arrangements although they are very difficult to obtain, that is the way in which we should progress. People talk of those who become Members when they are 40, but I do not look to my parliamentary pension to provide a sufficient pension for my old age. I look to whatever arrangements I had before becoming a Member. Unfortunately, as I was a civil servant for a large part of the time before becoming a Member I lost all my entitlement. That will not be the position in future. The correct way of dealing with the problem is not to allow that to be the case. If a person enters a career half way through his working life, or later, he should look to his previous career as well as to his new career for provision for his old age. If, as in my case, a person has no entitlement accruing from previous employment it is up to him to make additional provision, apart from his parliamentary pension, to cover the gap. If that is not done we shall be treating ourselves as generously as the judges—I accept that they are in a special position—and much more generously than others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are certain difficulties. First, many of the things the hon. Gentleman has mentioned have not happened, however desirable they may be. Secondly, it would not be possible for a person to make further provision from his parliamentary salary because the tax relief would be exhausted. Any further provision would have to be made out of net income. Thirdly, it would be anomalous in the public service to have a contributory pension, unlike the Civil Service pension.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it is true to say that a person is unable to secure tax relief for additional pension provision.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
There are two ways of making provision for old age. One is by means of an explicitly pensioned arrangement, and the other is by means of an insurance arrangement. It is arguable which is the more profitable; sometimes it is one and sometimes it is the other. Therefore, it is possible for a person in my situation to make an arrangement for his old age additional to that provided by the parliamentary pension, and to obtain some considerable tax relief upon it by using the relief which is available under an insurance scheme. But that is not the way he should do it. He should have provided for himself during his previous employments. If that is done, the problem does not arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems that my hon. Friend is making particular reference to professional people. Does he apply his argument to agricultural workers, for example, or other low-paid workers? When he makes reference to making some other provision, has he borne in mind that a person may be out of work for a number of years? Has my hon. Friend taken these matters into consideration?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) will not go too far with these interruptions. I think that we are getting a long way from the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall return to the amendment in one moment, Sir Stephen. The answer to the point that has been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. Roberts) is simply "Yes". I have taken into account the matters that he has raised.<br><br>
The pension disadvantages that apply to a large part of our population of working people also apply to a person who leaves another sort of employment to enter the House of Commons. However, I do not see why someone should be provided with a better pension when he becomes a Member. Equally, I find it hard to justify that a person should have a better pension arrangement in respect of the years when he has not been a Member.<br><br>
I believe that the amendment will have only two effects. First, it will not take away any advantage from any Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0531">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
who does not die or retire that the legislation as at present drafted would confer upon him. It would retain the advantage for those who die or retire during the present Parliament. They are the only people who would gain a benefit from the legislation as currently drafted.<br><br>
The practical effect is nil, except that those who have to run the fund have a real problem. In principle, payments should not be made into the fund in respect of anyone who does not die or retire; but those payments will be made; therefore, we shall have a fund being topped up to a level which is inappropriate to the pensions which will be paid. Surely that will make matters extremely difficult. As the amendment will not secure any desirable practical effect, only an undesirable and messy practical effect, I am inclined to oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Douglas Jay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intended to address a question to the hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean), but as the hon. Gentleman has left the Room I shall address my remarks to his hon. Friends. I ask for clarification. The amendment states:
<br><blockquote><p>"This section shall only apply to Members who retire or die on or before the dissolution of the present Parliament."</p></blockquote>
Suppose, as is likely, a Member of the present Parliament announced his intention to retire a week after the dissolution of Parliament. Would he be held to have retired on the dissolution? Suppose, as is even more likely, that a Member stood again but was unhappily defeated in the subsequent election, a Member who had shown no sign of wishing to retire until that moment but who then said that he did not propose to stand again. Would he be legally held to have retired on the dissolution, which might have occurred five or seek weeks before? Not being a lawyer, it is not clear to me what the words mean. I hope that their meaning will be made quite clear before we are asked to come to a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I trust that there are no Whipping arrangements being applied on the Bill. As the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) has said, this is preeminently a House of Commons matter, which has no content for the Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
or Opposition. It should not be determined on a party political basis.<br><br>
As a Member it is always a perplexing matter to listen to a debate, to follow the arguments and then to try to make up one's own mind. In fact, I did that on Second Reading. On that occasion I was persuaded by my hon. Friends the Members for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean) and Morecambe and Lonsdale (Mr. Hall-Davis). I was not persuaded by the arguments of the Minister of State. I voted for the reasoned amendment on Second Reading.<br><br>
With respect to the hon. Members for Normanton (Mr. Roberts) and Islington, South and Finsbury, they have partly missed the point of my hon. Friends' complaints. Some comments have been directed to the issue of the pay and conditions of Members of Parliament. When the Minister of State replied on Second Reading he summed up on the basis of what he considered to have been an attack on the position of hon. Members, and a lot of humbug from those who made cheap points about Members' salaries. I make it clear that almost everyone taking part in these debates is of the view that the present salary is inadequate, and that the way in which we deal with these matters is a mess.<br><br>
A fair amount of populist humbug has been expressed by a few Members. I entirely exempt my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Rathbone), who, I know, has strong and sincere views on this matter. However, one or two colleagues have found it an easy way of getting publicity and votes—namely, to denounce every increase that is proposed. The fact is that the House underpays itself and that the public do not realise that it does. We should have the courage to provide ourselves with proper pay and conditions as do members of other Parliaments.<br><br>
However, that is not the issue that is raised by the Bill. Given that the Government and Parliament have together got themselves in a mess over the level of salary to be paid to Members, the objection to the Bill is the form of what is being done to get us out of the mess. The real problem about the proposed salary and pension is not that they are adequate. For my part, I do not think they are. Given that they are what they are, are we acting in breach of a pay policy which is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0532">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
being imposed by Parliament on the rest of the community? Are we in breach of that policy because of the amount we are paying ourselves by way of salary? Are we making arrangements for tax relief on our pension contributions, by means of an Act of Parliament passed especially for the purpose, that would be denied to any other section of the community? Those are matters to which the Minister of State should direct himself.<br><br>
I was astonished when I heard the Minister of State on Second Reading. The burden of his case was that we were not acting in breach of the pay policy in respect of the wage we had given ourselves in the first place, and hence by the consequential pension arrangements. These matters depend entirely on the date on which there was an agreement to increase Members' salaries. The pay policy was announced on 11th July 1975. One of its terms was that any agreement to pay a higher salary that had been reached before that date could become operative. Those Members who had doubts pointed out that the Boyle Report was not published until 16th July.<br><br>
For the silliest of reasons the Government delayed publishing the Report. They did so for short-term political reasons. They feared that it would interfere with the settlement of a railways pay dispute, a dispute that has long since been forgotten, but they found that they had caught the parliamentary salary by their pay policy. However, I do not understand how the Minister could say that there was an agreement between employer and employee to pay a higher salary before the publication of the Boyle Report. To that extent I was astonished to hear him say that there was an agreement to take the date on the Boyle Report itself of 13th June.<br><br>
The Minister of State may repeat that, and may say that, as a result, our salary agreement is not in breach of the pay policy. If that be right, if we are not in breach of the pay policy, what on earth are we doing not paying ourselves £8,000 a year? What was the point of all the arguments we heard last year when the Government said that we had to pay ourselves an amount less than £8,000? The Government cannot have it both ways. If the Minister of State, who guided the House on the pay settlement last year, is now to say that there never was a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
breach of the pay policy, what are we mucking about at in not paying ourselves £8,000 but introducing a pension arrangement based on a £8,000 salary? I ask the Minister of State to make that clear. If we are not in breach of the pay policy, does the hon. Gentleman intend to allow the House to do something about Members' salaries?<br><br>
Having obtained a salary increase at a reduced level, but a pension that is linked to a notional salary, how long will the arrangement last? This is the point of Amendment No. 5. I accept the reasoning by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Bell). The amendment is almost certainly defective. If the Bill has an effect on tax relief, it would be extraordinary to give that relief only to those Members who are likely to retire, or who die, before the dissolution, whenever that may be. The amendment is trying to bring out that this should be a temporary arrangement, and that we have to have a special Act of Parliament for the almost comic purpose of linking our pension to a salary which we are not being paid.<br><br>
I do not accept what the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury said about the House not doing anything about the matter. I recall that when a vote took place on the £8,000 salary I took the inglorious position of abstaining. I abstained because I thought we were in breach of the pay policy.<br><br>
The other proposition was that we should link our salary to a Civil Service grade after the next election. The view was taken that that should not be done till after the next election, so that it could not be said that we were unfairly advantaging ourselves. It was thought that we should go through the electoral process before linking our salary to a Civil Service grade. I voted for that proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman say that he abstained on the £8,000 vote?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We did not vote on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, I abstained on whatever proposition was put before the House for a higher rate of pay.</span></p>

<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not vote on the proposal for an immediate increase of salary over and above the figure of £5,750. He abstained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe the hon. Gentleman is trying to get round this point, but I will look up the record to see exactly what I abstained on. I recall that I voted in favour of linking the salaries of MPs with those of civil servants after the next election.<br><br>
I am always doubtful about late night resolutions, because Governments do not act on them. On House of Commons matters on which the House is meant to decide its affairs Governments have a disgraceful record. I remember voting on various resolutions in respect of New Palace Yard, all of which were totally ignored; and I have a suspicion that that resolution, that we should link our salaries to those in the Civil Service, will be quietly forgotten unless we do something about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We cannot get involved in a discussion about this matter, which does not arise on the amendment. I hope the hon. Member will stick closely to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I be allowed to make this point? The hon. Gentleman abstained on the proposal to reduce the amount from £5,750 to £4,812. The hon. Gentleman is full of figures, but that is what he abstained on—the proposal to reduce the amount.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument, I recall now, was about the figure we should have in view of the pay policy, and those voting against said we should defy the pay policy. In logic, I felt that it was unfair, and that we should be governed by the pay policy. Therefore, I abstained.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interesting as this discussion is, I must remind the Committee that we are supposed to be discussing Amendments Nos. 2 and 5 and New Clause 1. I am interested in these reminiscences but they have nothing to do with the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not usually asked to clarify my vote at length.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
I return to Amendment No. 5, on the temporary nature of the Bill and its revisions, to ask, when are we to have our salaries linked with the Civil Service, with an annual review, and stop having to have special legislation and special resolutions and this embarrassing business all the time? Meanwhile, when are we to have an adjustment on the consequences of the pay policy since our pay was last increased? Given that we restrained our salaries last year giving rise to this Bill and the temporary arrangements, and restrained ourselves in line with the pay policy—and we have since had the £6 pay policy limit and now the second stage—it would be interesting to know whether the Government are to apply that to Members or whether we are to allow years to go before we try to catch up in some sudden, embarrassing leap.<br><br>
Finally, on pension arrangements, following what was said by the hon. Member for Normanton, when is the Boyle Committee to report on the pension structure generally? I support the case that one-fortieth would be an appropriate figure for the accruing of pensions of Members because of their particular career structure, but I trust that the Minister can say when the Boyle Committee is to report on the pension structure generally, and that he will say that those recommendations are to be accepted and not made the subject of any special legislation or special delays, and that they will be implemented, so that the Top Salaries Review Body will not be regarded as a dead letter till we can find a better system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Civil Service Department (Mr. Charles R. Morris)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has had a very wide ranging debate, and the amendments before it reflect to some extent the arguments that were put on Second Reading. Hon. Members who have tabled amendments at least have the merit of consistency.<br><br>
I want to pick up the main arguments advanced. That put by many speakers is that, by accepting the provisions in this clause, Members are creating a privileged position for themselves. To what extent is it privileged? All we are seeking to do is to establish a notional salary of £8,000 per annum as the salary on which the pension of retired Members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
will be based. Why do we need to have this provision? Because the House accepted and decided in July of last year that it would not accept the recommendation of the Top Salaries Review Body, the Boyle Committee, that generally the going rate for Members generally should be £8,000.<br><br>
We must recall the situation in which that decision was taken. As that time Members had waited over three and a half years for the Boyle Committee Report, during a period of rapid wage inflation. Those who argue that we are seeking to establish a privileged position for ourselves and that in some way we should take account of what has happened in the private sector should, if they are sincere and genuine in their argument, show evidence of any individuals or groups in the private sector who have voluntarily restricted their remuneration, and done so in any way comparable to the way that Members have inflicted restraint upon themselves. On Second Reading I argued that I was not aware of any company, body of workers or individuals in the private sector who had been under that restriction, had waited for three and a half years, and then, when a recommendation came forward that they should be paid £8,000 per annum, had voluntarily forgone 28 per cent. of that increase because of their concern for the national economy and the difficulties facing the nation at that time. Those who would seek to represent Members as grasping and greedy should be reminded that they voluntarily forwent 28 per cent. of the increase recommended in July 1975 by the Boyle Committee. I know of no other class of individuals in the private sector or elsewhere who have voluntarily inflicted that degree of restraint upon themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has said Members had forgone 28 per cent. of the amount recommended by the Boyle Committee. The amount was more like 58 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Bell).<br><br>
I want to deal with a point made by the hon. Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke), who asked whether we are acting in breach of the pay policy. He rehearsed the argument we had had on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
Second Reading that 22nd July was possibly a more realistic date. I want to reiterate the point I made in winding up on that occasion, that the date before the Committee was 13th June and that it was in line with pay policy; and it is on that the provisions of this clause are framed.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then asked "If we are not in breach of the pay policy why did we not accept the £8,000 as recommended by Boyle?" Frankly, this was a decision of the House of Commons.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ogden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to try to put the boot in on my hon. Friend whom I have known for a long time, both in and outside Brandon Colliery, but it is not sufficient for him to say that this was a decision of the House. It was a decision of the House of Commons; it was a decision of the House on which every hon. Member had the right to make up his own mind; but it was on the recommendation of the Government of the day, whom I and my hon. Friend support. It was voluntary, though many people had their arm twisted. But this is buck passing. We cannot pass the buck around. We all had a share in this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Ogden) for his intervention. I do not take issue with him on the general point because I take the point of the hon. Member for Rushcliffe that essentially it was a House of Commons matter and a House of Commons decision. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing my attention to the phrase I used, which, perhaps, was not of the best.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was repeating the argument that it was outside the pay policy because the date of the Boyle Report was 13th June last year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that basis can it be said that there was between employer and employee an agreement which committed the Government to pay a given rate of salary, if that is only a way of getting outside the pay policy? I do not see how the date of the Boyle Report, 13th June, reflects any agreement of any kind allowing a private employer to get round the pay policy.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wholly accept that Members of Parliament stand in an employee-employer relationship to anyone. They are not employees of the Government as employers.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman contradicts himself in referring to linkage. To justify his argument on the employer-employee relationship he has reached out and said that we ought to be related to the Civil Service and then we would not get into this kind of mess. We cannot on the one hand argue that we should determine our own salaries and argue on the other hand that there should be a relationship, an analogy, between our salaries and those of civil servants. The body which determined the recommendation, the Boyle Committee, was completely independent. That committee was not an arm of Government. No parliamentarians were represented on it. So the recommendation for £8,000 came to the Government and to the House of Commons in the form of a report dated 13th June.<br><br>
We are not seeking to dodge anything or to benefit ourselves by merely taking that date. It was a reasonable decision, against the background, first, that the Boyle Committee was independent and had been looking at the situation over a long period of time; and secondly, that Members had waited for three and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rathbone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. He is saying that the Boyle Committee is completely independent and recommended the £8,000 on 13th June; but that recommendation was acted upon and became a commitment to not £8,000 but to £5,750 in the debate on 25th July. That was when the commitment was made. That was when a coach and horses were driven through the pay policy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This reflects the fact that individual hon. Members were seeking to be fair in the context of the policy applying to the community generally. I come back to what I was saying earlier. I do not think it is unreasonable, having waited for three and half years, to take the 13th June. That is the reality of the argument.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I want to take up a further point made by the hon. Member for Rushcliffe when referring to the provision for a notional
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
salary, tied up with what he said about establishing an analogy with the Civil Service. One would get the impression, listening to this debate, that we are establishing some new precedent. It is not true. If one looks for an analogy in the Civil Service one needs to go back to 1931 and the Geddes axe at that time. At that time, civil servants' salaries were cut by 10 per cent., but the Government of the day quickly accepted that their pensions would not be affected by that cut. Subsequently, at the time of the Chorley Committee, the Government of the day again accepted that the proposals which emerged from that committee's consideration would not affect the pensions of the individual grades of civil servants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the Minister stretching the analogy somewhat to raise the recollection of a situation where pensions were not cut, and equating that situation with one where pensions are to rise in relation to a notional salary?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is still a notional salary. It is not the salary being received by civil servants.<br><br>
We are not in any way establishing a precedent. In the current situation what was decided, what the House of Commons endorsed, as far as civil servants are concerned, was that for those receiving over £8,500, who are restricted by the pay policy, the pensions will not be affected and will be based on the Government's acceptance of the Boyle Committee's recommendations regarding those salaries. On that basis, I feel there is justification for rejecting the amendments and new clause.<br><br>
There have been one or two questions posed by my hon. Friends the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) and the Member for West Derby, and the hon. Member for Rushcliffe. They inquired what the Government's attitude is in regard to the current stage of pay policy. They referred to the £6 limit and the second stage, the 4·5 per cent. limit. I can inform the Committee that these matters are under consideration at present but no Government decision has been made as yet.<br><br>
On the question of the Government's intention regarding linkage, we intend to pursue the question of linkage but in the light of the continuing constraints of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0536">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
counter-inflation programme the Government feel that the moment is still not opportune to pursue the question in depth by a Select Committee or by some other suitable way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister can confirm that the Government regard as binding upon themselves—and it does not matter whether they do or do not because it is—the resolution which the House passed last 22nd July, which said that in the opinion of the House, it was decided on principle that there should be a linkage and linkage to a particular specified grade in the Civil Service and that it should be brought fully into effect three months after the next Parliament. That must depend on the will of the next Parliament, but I hope the Minister can say that the Government are not retreating one iota from that. If they are, they are in straightforward breach of a resolution passed by the House, the only type of resolution ever passed on the matter of Members' salaries. If they do that, they will be in big trouble.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. It gives me the opportunity of clarifying the position as far as the Government are concerned.<br><br>
The Government are not seeking to retreat from a decision of the House of Commons. I am aware, and all Members of the Committee will accept, that the present Parliament cannot bind a future Parliament. In any event, the next Parliament, and I say this with respect, is still, I hope, a long way off, and it is contrary, the Government believe, to the spirit of the present incomes policy to enter into commitments which can only be implemented in the indefinite future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely my hon. Friend is prepared to go a little further than that? Of course he is entitled to say that the decision of one Parliament does not bind the next. He is also entitled to say that this resolution is only binding unless and until Parliament alters it. Surely he can assure us that till Parliament does do that it is the intention of the Government to carry it out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can give my right hon. Friend that assurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ogden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Stephen. There are a number of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
questions that I wanted to put on the wider aspects of this. Is it your intention to allow everything and all aspects of the clause to be debated on this amendment, or to allow a further debate on the Question, That the clause stand part of the Bill?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to commit myself too far in advance, but I would have thought that we have had a sufficiently wide-ranging discussion of the clause so far. However, I do not want to commit myself now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCrindle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not sure whether the Minister had resumed his seat, but could I persuade him to answer one simple point arising out of the recent exchanges? If the Minister says that one Parliament cannot commit another, and confirms that, nevertheless, a resolution having been passed by the House, the Government must take note of it, what is all this nonsense about the Government considering whether a Select Committee is the right way to proceed? The resolution makes clear that it is the wish of the House of Commons to link salaries and pensions to a particular grade in the Civil Service. Is that not the end of it? Are not the Government required to do just that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles R. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I made the reference to the Select Committee following a point put to me by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby. He made the suggestion to me. I thought I was being helpful to the Committee in dealing with it, perhaps saving him the time of getting to his feet again. In seeking to be helpful to the Committee I should have learned from past experience that it only adds to one's difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It will help the Minister and all hon. Members if the remarks made are all in order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose it is in order, under the new clause, because we are moving the Second Reading of the new clause, to debate what is not in it—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not moving the second reading of the new clause. We are discussing it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Sir Stephen. In the discussion we can refer to what is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
not in the new clause. What the hon. Member has said about linking is not in it. Presumably it is in order.<br><br>
I have been attempting to support the Government's line on this Bill, which is not a very familiar posture for me. I am a little bit appalled by what the Minister has been saying. We did, after all, approach this Bill on the assumption that it is temporary, to get us over a difficulty that has arisen. I have been suggesting to my hon. Friends that they should not be making too much heavy weather of these amendments, because this Bill is a procedural tying up of loose ends. Then the Minister comes along and says "No. This is semi-permanent. The Government accept the principle of the linkage resolution. They are not going to go back on it, but they are not going to do anything about it." They accept it, just as one accepts the North Pole or the Equator or any of those things; but the Government have no intention of taking any action.<br><br>
I must say to the Minister that one then begins to look at these amendments and the new clause in a slightly different light. If he is telling us that this is just drifting on he must do a little bit better than the form of words handed to him on the piece of paper that he read out.<br><br>
I do not want to go into this in depth, but I want the matter gone into and sorted out. The resolution was specific. The rank of Assistant Secretary was mentioned in the resolution. I did not choose that grade. It has produced some remarkable results since then. The Assistant Secretary's salary has gone up to £11,000 or £12,000 or so since we passed that resolution. It has certainly gone up a long way, anyway. None of us likes this kind of gadgetry.<br><br>
It is only acceptable if it is a short-term device to regularise the position of, I suppose one might say, older Members, who would otherwise be left out on a limb. It has to apply to the whole House. That is why the amendment proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean) is defective. To achieve what he wants he would have to say the effect of this Bill should be limited to the life of the present Parliament. That would make sense. To say it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
applies to only Members who retire or die on or before the end of the present Parliament is nonsense.<br><br>
Never mind the wording. The purpose of the amendments we are debating is to try to make this a temporary provision, holding over to the end of the present Parliament, more or less. I know that the new clause in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Rathbone) does not say "end of the present Parliament". It refers to the next pay increase. It is the same thing. All of them are with the thought in the minds of my hon. Friends and everybody else that these arrangements regarding the notional salary end at the end of the present Parliament, because of the linkage resolution. That is what we have all been thinking.<br><br>
If the Minister says "No" and makes all kinds of excuses—that one Parliament can not bind the next. Actually one Parliament can bind the next, subject to repeal. This is not so much a Parliament but a House of Commons resolution which does not bind anybody, except morally, but this affects the perspective in which we look at the Bill. I must ask the Minister to say whether this situation will drift on and whether what is proposed is to become a rather dangerous precedent. That will not do. If hon. Members are saying "Well, we dealt with ourselves a pretty peculiar way last July. Nobody else in the country, having been offered an increase up to £8,000, would have taken a minor part only of it" and, therefore, it is perfectly legitimate. It would be outrageous if Members who retire shortly were paid this miniscule pension. But that is one thing.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
However, if the Minister is saying "I am afraid that this will drift on till further notice", that is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. The hon. Gentleman in this Committee this morning is in no position to withdraw what he has just said. He got that by remit from above. I know that we shall have to pass this Bill as it stands, but I hope he will take back to those above him a very clear message from this Committee that we do not like that situation at all; that we are passing this Bill because we do not see any alternative, but that neither we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0538">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
nor the House as a whole will be happy if this is to be a permanent feature of our legislative arrangements for the allowance of income tax on pension contributions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been suggested that one Parliament cannot bind its successor but, as the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Bell) has reminded the Committee, the position is slightly different in that a succeeding Parliament can undo, but till it undoes the previous situation subsists. Hon. Members may ask themselves where they got their Standing Orders from. They are never passed by a new Parliament; they are deemed to subsist from Parliament to Parliament without ever being renewed. So one can always find a daft precedent for anything that one tries to oppose.<br><br>
The Minister suggested that there is some incompatibility between Members being in charge of their own salaries and pensions, and linking them to the Civil Service. I suggest that that is nonsense, and I ask him to think of the American example. The American Congress is in charge of its own remuneration and would give short shrift to any President who interfered. It has a very simple rule about linkage to the Civil Service which we might try to emulate at some time, which is that no civil servant can be paid more than a Congressman. That is something which can be repealed at any time, but Congress keeps charge of it and has a linkage.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to look at the last words of a resolution passed by a large majority, larger than most Bills in the House have been passed by, of 160 votes to 70. The resolution does not apply only to the next Parliament. There are two parts to it, the first of which relates to the next Parliament and the next part states:
<br><blockquote><p>…the salaries of Members"—</p></blockquote>
that is up to the time of the next Parliament—
<br><blockquote><p>"should be increased by not less than the same amount of increase as these Assistant Secretaries."</p></blockquote>
There is no question of setting up a Select Committee to look at that. It would be unprecedented for the House to pass a resolution and then for any Member to put a motion on the Order
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
Paper to have it referred to a Select Committee or investigated by them. The decision has been taken and carried by a large majority. So the Minister should explain whether any increase has been awarded to Assistant Secretaries since the passing of that resolution and I think the answer is "No".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Albert Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the £8,500 cut off.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that at the time we passed the resolution there was a range from £8,500 to £11,000, and as we did not specify a point in the range it is legitimate to take £8,500. I believe I am right in saying that no increase has been awarded to Assistant Secretaries since then, and, therefore, there has been no occasion to implement those final words of the resolution. There will presumably come a time in the next few months when an increase will be awarded to Assistant Secretaries, and there is no doubt at all that the Government can stop thinking about it. They are not free to think about setting up a Select Committee or anything else. The House of Commons has decided that that payment will be made to Members of Parliament and that is the end of it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Minister said in reply to my hon. Friend that it is the intention of the Government to carry out the resolution. I hope that that is confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even if he says the opposite it does not matter, because in this country the House of Commons takes decisions, not the Government. So it would not be appropriate to set up any Select Committee since the decision has already been taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is taking advice to clarify his reaction to what the hon. Member has just said, because the key question is: is the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Cunningham) right when he says that the resolution has a binding effect? I trust that he is right. Resolutions of that kind are usually mere expressions of opinion, but I understand that our salaries are determined by resolutions of the House and no other legislation is required, but the Minister is in the best position to advise us. Is it a fact that our salaries are now determined
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0539">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
by that resolution, so that unless another motion is put on the Order Paper we shall be linked after the next election, and meanwhile will get Assistant Secretaries' increases? The Minister should tell us so that we know on what footing we are discussing New Clause 1. Have we by that resolution changed the basis of our salaries, and is it legally binding? If the Government wanted to go back on that, would they have to put down a motion on the Order Paper and persuade the House of Commons to carry it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ogden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There were a number of resolutions passed on the night of 22nd-23rd July. Four of them, at least, affect the salary that we now receive. It would seem strange if the Government were to argue "Yes, four of the resolutions were binding on the Government and they have been implemented, but the one which it is said should be carried through will not be." It will be a very strange situation if they are selective about what happened on that night. Members of the Committee may have heard the story about the present Prime Minister. Someone asked "What kind of a person is he?" The reply was "He is a very nice man. He would not hurt anyone. If he had to hang you, he would make sure you were comfortable before he opened the trap door."<br><br>
We have to take the opportunity of pressing Ministers who, for one reason or another, are opposing something. The only way we can do that is by being difficult to the Minister of State. This is nothing personal, but he knows how difficult he can be on occasion, and he also knows how difficult we can be.<br><br>
I have a lot of questions to ask him and I shall ask the shorter ones first. I may have to wait for a reply, because Ministers for the Civil Service do not give the fastest replies in the West. What is the position of a widow or of dependants of a Member of Parliament who dies or retires between 23rd July 1975 and the enactment of the Bill? We have lost Members and there are reports that they may get some help, so what is the position in the interim period?<br><br>
Also, what is the position of Members of Parliament inside the general pay policy which is being argued and negotiated?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
When is the Boyle Committee due to report? In my hon. Friend's letter of 10th May he used the immortal words:
<br><blockquote><p>"You also asked about the TSRB's report on Members' pensions, etc. The Review Body is continuing its work in this, but I am afraid that I can give no date for publication as yet. I can assure you, of course, that there will be no unavoidable delay."</p></blockquote>
The words of the previous Lord President of the Council were "There will be no unavoidable delay". But as the clouds of the incomes policy appeared we knew that someone was aware of what was in the Boyle Report and was sitting on it hard, and it may be that this next report is also being sat on hard. I hope that my hon. Friend will excuse me when say that when I look at the words "no unavoidable delay" I am filled with mistrust and misgiving.<br><br>
I now come to the linkage, which is the key. The House of Commons passed a resolution and the Government should say what action they are taking, such as "We can bring in notional salaries at one stage." Certainly, we do not want to go through the whole rigmarole of having to start this again in a new Parliament.<br><br>
Those few words from me may have helped my hon. Friend in one way: he may have had time now to have some answers.<br><br>
Finally, this is a House of Commons matter, and it would have been helpful, and I personally should have appreciated it, if the Leader of the House of Commons had taken a little more interest in it. I do not know his point of view, although there are reports of what it is. I should have appreciated it if he could only have written us a line or come in. I know that he is at a Cabinet meeting this morning and he is talking about the devolution of Scotland this afternoon, but, with respect to him, his first duty is to Members of the House of Commons, and this is a House of Commons matter. If he could give an indication of his interest, it would be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles R. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Ogden) and all Members of the Committee who have prefaced their contributions with the words "I am endeavouring to be helpful". I can only say that with friends such as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0540">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
I have there are undoubtedly difficulties ahead.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Bell), with his usual perception, said that I had taken recourse to reading from my brief a point on the question of linkages. I felt that I ought to read precisely what the Government's position is, because that will, no doubt, help my right hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay). The Government certainly intend to pursue the question of linkage, but in the light of the continuing constraints—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Pursue in what sense? Chase it away?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —but in the continuing constraints of the counter-inflation programme, they feel that the moment is still not opportune to pursue the matter in depth.<br><br>
The point was made by my hon. Friend that we are talking about a resolution of the House and he asked, is this mandatory? Is it a decision of the House which the Government will be obliged to implement? Perhaps you, Sir Stephen, are in a much better position than I am to interpret the constitutional position in regard to the resolution that was carried by the House.<br><br>
My hon. Friend referred to the majority so far as the linkage is concerned, but I do not recall there being a convincing majority. I am open to correction, but I am talking about the question of linkage. If I remember rightly—and my hon. Friend can correct me because he has the <i>Hansard</i> report before him—the Tellers reported to the House a vote of 128 to 127.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ogden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was the amendment and we all know the circumstances in which that one hon. Gentleman got into that Lobby, but do not discuss them. That is irrelevant. When the affirmative resolution was put to the House, when it was a question of that or nothing—and the whole resolution went on the Order Paper—the figures were 160 for the Ayes and 70 for the Noes. The Government can nationalise various industries on a vote of six or 10, and they ought to pass this through when there is a majority of 90. It was an affirmative resolution of the House of Commons, passed by a larger
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
majority than any of the other resolutions which the Government have accepted and implemented since that night.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. George Cunningham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that the following afternoon, because of the circumstances in which there had been a close vote, one hon. Member raised the matter with Mr. Speaker and Mr. Speaker rejected his submission definitely, and among his remarks appear the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"The House appeared to come to a decision."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 23rd July, 1975: Vol. 896, c. 572.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to be helpful. I am sure the Minister is not trying to side-track us. I trust that he will not leave the constitutional position where he did, because hon. Members believed that they had altered their salary position and the Government cannot say "The Government do not know whether hon. Members have or have not". At least he should tell us the decision of the Government on expert advice. Is the House of Commons going to change the basis of these arrangements, and if it is, what does it have to do to make sure it does so, and get linkage into it after the next election?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is the fourth intervention upon an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping I was intervening in the Minister's speech. My recollection is that this resolution we are talking about is not a resolution but an amendment of a resolution moved by a Minister of the Crown and that then the resolution as amended was passed by the majority stated. If it was a resolution moved by a Minister of the Crown, and treated for other purpoes as virtually a Supply Day matter, it seems to me it is an effective operative decision of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kenneth Clarke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must know whether it was or not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am in some difficulty. I have not got the advice available to me on the constitutional position arising from the resolution, but if it would be convenient for the Committee I am positively eager to get that advice and impart it to the Committee, but at this

time I have not got that advice and I cannot comment on the constitutional position. I have sought to illuminate the Government approach to the question of linkage, which is not directly relevant to the clauses of this Bill.<br><br>
Dealing with the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby about widows, the widows in the category to which he referred have been paid pensions on the basis of existing pensionable salaries, effectively at £7,300 up to 12th June 1975, that is £4,500 plus pensions increases up to 12th June 1975 and £5,750 since 13th June. When this Bill goes through they will be paid the extra resulting from the notional pensionable salary from 13th June 1975. Such retrospection is authorised by Clause 1(4) of the Bill.<br><br>
On the general question of hon. Members' pensions, as the hon. Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke) indicated, this is the subject of consideration by the Top Salaries Review Body. He implored me to be more specific in giving the Committee an idea of when that report is likely to be made. With the best will in the world, and seeking to be helpful, all I can possibly say is "in the near future ". I only say that because I have been involved in too many reports, giving dates, only to find that they have subsequently slipped, but I am sure that it will be in the very near future.<br><br>
Having said all that I ask the Committee to reject the amendments and the proposed new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rathbone</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This discussion seems to have stirred up more mud than it has created clarity. It seems to have underlined the need to make this Bill a temporary measure in the way I hoped to do by my advocacy of New Clause 1. I should like to suggest the withdrawal of Amendment No. 2, but to seek the support of my hon. Friends and hon. Members opposite in carrying New Clause 1. So I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>The CHAIRMAN, <i>being of opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereupon had been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, forthwith put the Question, pursuant to</i>

<p><i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ogden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I should raise this matter on the Short Title, or as a point of order or on a motion that the Committee should adjourn, but we have asked a number of questions and there is a slight point whether the resolution is binding on the House, or whether the Minister said it is the intention of the Government to pursue linkage, or whether the Government accept the resolution. There is a difference. One can do all sorts of things in pursuance, but that is not going so far as saying that the Government are bound. It is difficult to get this kind of thing through the House, but unless we get it cleared up this morning—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles R. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I gave the assurance that at report I shall seek to deal with the whole position of linkage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jay</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would draw the attention of the Committee again to the fact that the Minister has said in answer to my hon. Friend that it was the Government's intention to carry out the decision of the House. Presumably, he has not withdrawn that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Charles R. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking to clarify that statement when I read from my official brief. It is clarification which affects the Government position. Generally speaking, on this aspect I shall seek to make the Government's position abundantly clear on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we cannot go on discussing this on the Question, That Clause 9 stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
