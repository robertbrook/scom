PREPARATION AND CONTENTS OF TRANSFER SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Further amendment proposed (4th May)</i>—No. 77, in page 4, line 19, at end, to insert
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Any transfer scheme shall include arrangements whereby tenants of dwellings to be transferred are given the right to purchase the dwellings in which they are living subject to the conditions laid out in Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular 54/70 for the sale of council houses and provided that they complete the purchase within six months of the transfer of housing assets from the relevant New Town Corporation having taken place. This provision shall be subject to regulations under this section by the Secretary of State, which shall be made by Statutory Instrument. Regulations shall not be made under this section unless a draft has been approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament".—[<i>Mr. Raison.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Planning and Local Government (Mr. John Silkin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I delayed my speech until today because the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) had another engagement and I thought that the debate he raised was important enough for him to be present when I was replying. It was a very good debate. Both sides of the Committee had their views and expressed them clearly. Of course, to some extent they were dealing with different sides of a general question. That is to say, I think the Opposition were broadly dealing with what was the almost platitudinous point that certain tenants of houses would like to buy those houses. I fully accept that. Equally, my hon. Friends were making the point that, for various reasons, certain tenants of rented accommodation would not want to buy their houses. I think both points are self-evident.<br><br>
The amendment itself is a defective amendment. There is no question about that. It has the rather charming defect, among others, of being the first amendment
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 136</span>
—the first I know of—to attempt to put into a statute a departmental circular. I gather that the authors of that circular are out celebrating the point with champagne. It has never been done before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Timothy Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may or not be the case, but, after all, the right hon. Gentleman belongs to a Government who have put an annexe from the TUC in statutory form.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And what makes the hon. Gentleman think that the TUC did not celebrate with champagne?<br><br>
As far as the circular is concerned, there is one distinguished difference between the circular and the TUC document, and that is that the circular can be withdrawn at any moment or amended in any way because it is an administrative document and has no force of law. It would create a difficulty in statute terms.<br><br>
The second thing is that, not for the first time in this Committee, the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have given me a compliment which, I must confess, is, perhaps, a little undeserving. They talk in terms of a sale being dependent upon its completion within six months of transfer. Of course, I am not allowed to advertise, but there are certain solicitors who can always be depended upon to complete any purchase within six months, but there are others who could not.<br><br>
I take the hon. Member for Aylesbury's point that the fact that an amendment put down by the Opposition, or any other hon. Member, is defective in drafting is really not of great importance. The important point is the substantive point, and if it is right, it is the Government's duty, in that event, to remedy the defect and put the amendment down in proper form. I fully accept that.<br><br>
I would like to discuss the real question which the amendment brings out. The hon. Gentleman brought this out very forcefully in his speech last Tuesday. Some other points were raised by his hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller). If the amendment were to be accepted, then, after the transfer from the development corporation to the local authority, the council in question would be forced to offer houses for sale to sitting tenants whether it wished to do so or not. That would be a situation which no other local authority in the country is in. One
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0452">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 137</span>
would be saying to local authorities who happen to be in new town areas that they must do this, whereas the local authority next door does not have to do so. I cannot quite understand why there should be this municipal apartheid as far as new town local authorities are concerned.<br><br>
The circular which the amendment mentions, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular 54/70 introduced by a Conservative Government, says it is the Government's intention to give local authorities greater responsibility to manage their affairs, and it was, as it were, in support of that principle that the circular said that it was removing the restriction on sales. The amendment, far from giving greater responsibility to manage their affairs would, if it were accepted, take away the responsibility to manage their affairs.<br><br>
Having said that the amendment is defective for statute law I must say that it seems to be a bit defective also in common sense, as it is going right across the principle of that circular. I should add that, later, there was another circular. By that time the Ministry of Housing and Local Government had become the Department of the Environment which we all know and love so well. The Department of the Environment Circular 56/72, again introduced by Conservative Ministers, imposed a requirement that rented houses should be made available for purchase. The amendment is advocating that the new town local authorities, and new town local authorities alone, should have this imposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is evident that the reason we confined the matter to the new town authorities is that anything else would have been outside the scope of the Bill and it would not have been possible to have brought it forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah, I understand that, but in the event, perhaps not for the first time, I might ask the party opposite to give the country in general a much clearer line of demarcation so that we know exactly where we stand. It must not only say this in party policy but should be using the possibilities of the House of Commons to seek amendments to other legislation in order to alter the situation. That has not yet been done. However, to single out the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 138</span>
new towns is to create a kind of municipal apartheid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Gentleman is being less than fair. I am not a lawyer, but the Bill as it stands, and so our amendment, have nothing to do with a local authority. The Bill is about development corporations, which are central Government bodies, and the amendment relates to central Government policy prior to the actual transfer of property to the local authority. The right hon. Gentleman is being less than fair in criticising my hon. Friend because we are not dictating to the local authority. We are saying that central Government should give these tenants the opportunity to buy before a transfer is made. After that it is entirely up to the local authority what it does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman but I would urge him to read his own amendment. It talks about after transfer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason we talk in terms of six months after transfer is that it is evident that it might not be possible to complete the transfer in the period between the initiation of the transfer process and the day when the transfer actually takes place. The amendment is related to the transfer. My hon. Friend is perfectly right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be related to the transfer. With that I was not in any way arguing. I was pointing to the transfer when the property has <i>ipso facto</i> become the property of the local authority—major difference between that authority and other local authorities would be that the former would alone have this obligation. It would be to the advantage of the Committee if hon. Gentlemen opposite occasionally read their own amendments.<br><br>
The argument, as I understood it, which the Opposition were making, was that there was some dogmatic, rigid and doctrinaire basis of opposition to owner-occupation on the part of the Labour Government. The more I think about it the more extraordinary, if not outrageous, that argument becomes. One only has to look at the percentage of owner-occupation which existed even before the last Labour Government came into power to see that this is absolute nonsense. I personally think it is right for a man to own his own
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0453">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 139</span>
house. Just as it is right for a man to own his own car, it seems to be perfectly reasonable for him to own his own house. There is no doctrinaire feeling about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Maureen Colquhoun</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or a woman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, man in law embraces woman. That is well known.<br><br>
In 1964, if I may go on, perhaps, to a slightly different point, the percentage of owner-occupation in this country was 45.6 per cent. at the moment when the then Labour Government took office. When we gave up office in 1970 the figure had risen to 50 per cent. When we took office again in 1974 it was just over 52 per cent., and it is now 53 per cent. One can see that under successive Labour Governments the percentage of owner-occupation has increased.<br><br>
I make this point because, quite rightly, the hon. Member for Aylesbury pointed out that under my very distinguished predecessor, Mr. Richard Crossman, guidance was given to the then new towns—some of the development corporations were not in existence at that time—to go for a 50-50 owner-occupation/rented basis. It is fair to make the point that Mr. Crossman also pointed out that, as far as we were concerned, we were not prejudiced against owner-occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman submit that guidance to new town councils, since in some of the older new towns like Crawley the proportion of rented accommodation far exceeds that of the private ownership? Recently, in Crawley itself, land which was specifically bought by the council for sale to private developers has now been offered to certain London boroughs for council rented accommodation. Would the right hon. Gentleman say what he thinks about this example, and resubmit his guidance to the new town local authorities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving a worthy and dignified preamble to the point I was just about to deal with. Mr. Crossman's point of 50-50 has to be viewed against a certain background. That background was, the highest number of houses ever built in this country in a year—nearly 500,000 houses. It was in that perspective and against that background that Richard Crossman's pronouncement was made.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 140</span>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
The backcloth which greeted me in March, 1974 was of a uniform blank as far as new towns were concerned. The whole basis of the new towns was, as the hon. Gentleman knows, because he represents, among other areas, a very distinguished and early new town that we should reach a situation where houses would be available upon demand. What was the situation in Crawley, for example, at that stage in March 1974? The waiting period was 65 weeks. It could hardly be called a situation of houses on demand. In Northampton the waiting period was one year, in Redditch it was about the same, in Welwyn and Hatfield it was about the same and in Harlow it was a little longer. This was the situation I had to face in March 1974.<br><br>
I will not say that it is wrong to say that people want to buy houses in which they are living as tenants. I fully accept that. The hon. Member for Aylesbury did well to quote Cullingworth. I make no point about how long ago that was. It was 11 years ago, but it might well be that the same results would apply today. However, I want to point out one thing in quoting from Cullingworth A large number of development corporation tenants said "Yes, we would like to buy our own homes." When it came to whether they would like to buy the homes in which they themselves were living the proportion changed quite considerably. I quote from page 133 and here I am talking about sitting tenants:
<br><blockquote><p>"Only one quarter of the tenants wanted to buy the houses in which they lived".</p></blockquote>
I have to add that Cullingworth did not examine people on the waiting lists. It might have been a good idea if he had. If they had been asked, I have a feeling that their replies might have been so strong that the quarter would have gone down very much further.<br><br>
I had this problem in March 1974. I think I took the right decision because, as I look at the waiting periods of the various development corporations I see they have in some cases come down quite dramatically and in others they have come down not perhaps as well as one would have liked.<br><br>
The question arises, are we concerned with one issue and one issue only, purely the right of those who are most fortunate to buy the houses in which they live as tenants, or are we concerned with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0454">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 141</span>
general proposition that so long as there is a need it is our duty to cater for that need? That is the gulf between the two sides of the Committee. It is because of my awareness of that gulf that I ask the Committee to deal with this amendment by voting overwhelmingly against it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like to follow the right hon. Gentleman in what he said, and also my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) in his remarks in the last debate, which I have read with the greatest interest. I would like to follow the right hon. Gentleman's speech more from the financial angle than from any particular question of party political difference.<br><br>
I wish to examine the point not on the question of the rights of the tenant to buy his own house, which I would firmly sustain, but on the point which the right hon. Gentleman himself made on the question of satisfying the need for the provision of houses in areas where there are long waiting lists. As he well knows, and he referred to it in his speech, Crawley New Town is a town where the waiting list has grown and is still growing substantially.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, let us get the facts straight before we go on. The waiting period in Crawley in March 1974 was 65 weeks. The waiting period today is 48 weeks. It is not growing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the figures from the Chief Executive of Crawley New Town. The figures he was good enough to give me show that the housing waiting list has grown by 10 per cent. during the last year. The waiting list, furthermore, is certainly longer than 65 weeks. It is much nearer two years, and I believe it is in excess of that. Unless something has happened dramatically within the last week or two the figures I obtained for the Second Reading debate demonstrate to me that the information I have given, which comes from the chief executive, is right. I would be interested to hear more figures if the right hon. Gentleman has them from his advisers. Even the argument which the right hon. Gentleman is putting forward, which is that the waiting list is less than 65 weeks, is a good argument for suggesting that the number of houses built for sale should be increased, not diminished.<br><br>
The point is, how does one approach this problem of a growing area where there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 142</span>
is a long and growing waiting list? The first thing to do is to consider why it is that the waiting list, despite the major building programme—and this applies to other new towns apart from Crawley—is growing so substantially. It is not just a question of the provision of more houses in one area because of an expanding population or industrial demand. The reason plainly must be that if the price of the rent of a council house is substantially below what is the going rate there will be a waiting list for those houses. All the economic forces and all the forces of the market determine that that must be the case. While the council rate, as it is in Crawley, is substantially below the level of the market rent there will, in my judgment, always be a substantial demand for those houses. My evidence is that the demand is growing still, and it would surprise me if it did not continue to grow, despite the large building programme upon which the Crawley Council is engaged. That building programme is for an average of 500 houses a year, but in my opinion it is still not sufficient to contain the demand which will occur because of the action of market forces, if for no other reason.<br><br>
I want to come back to the point made by the right hon. Gentleman. It is not a question of party philosophy, but about the means by which housing can be provided. The figures which Crawley Council has publicly produced, and the figures which are available in the New Towns Commission report, show that the rent which is paid by the tenants is £6 per week, and that the cost of maintaining those houses and servicing the interest charges is £25 per week. I understand that over the country as a whole the level of rents makes up about 50 per cent.—I think that is the figure—of the cost of running the houses. The figure may be somewhat different, but I think that is about it. In Crawley the level which the rents make up is only 25 per cent. If it were not for the proposal in this Bill to hand over the housing assets of the New Towns Commission to the local authority that problem would become perfectly intolerable. Even after the handing over of the housing assets—and there are nearly 10,000 New Towns Commission houses in Crawley—the amount which rents will make up of the total cost of servicing the debt and administering and repairing those houses, and so on, will be some 60 per cent.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0455">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 143</span>
Unfortunately it is a static position for the reason that the council building programme is so large in comparison with its present stock of houses. So unless policies are changed significantly one of two things will happen.<br><br>
Unless council house rents are raised the proportion which rents bear to the cost of administration is likely to fall rapidly below 50 per cent. As the right hon. Gentleman will know, it is the Government's proposal in the Public Expenditure White Paper that rents should cover 50 per cent., on average over the country by 1978–79. If the trend goes on as it is, it is certain that, despite the fact that the New Towns Commission houses will be handed over to the council, it will fall well below 50 per cent., at which time the council will either have to cease the building programme altogether or look to the taxpayer, through the Government, for more funds to support it. That is certain to be the position. Either the council house building programme will grind to a halt or the rents will be raised substantially. I am not talking about a small increase. This is bound to happen unless the Government's total housing policy over the whole country is changed and unless they are prepared through national subsidies to make the proportion which rents bear to total expenses rather above the level of 50 per cent. I do not think they will do that, or that the Treasury would allow them to do that. Rents must rise or the council house building programme will stop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would like always to be able to resolve differences between the hon. Gentleman and myself. Listening to the argument he is adducing it occurs to me that when he is talking about waiting lists he is talking about the district council waiting list. I was talking about the new town list. I have no authority over the district council, only over the new towns. My figures are right, and his may be also.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the normal course of amity between myself and my pair has been restored. I was referring to the council list and not the new town list. All is well once more between us after many years.<br><br>
I come to more contentious matters. I would like to put forward some differing proposals from those which the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 144</span>
Gentleman has presented so far. I maintain that it would be in the council's best interests to carry out the policy that it wants to follow by offering tenants their houses for sale. Not only is it substantially borne out by the Cullingworth Report that people would like to own their own houses. The course of the local elections last week, when it was a substantial plank in the Conservative Party's policy that tenants should be able to buy their own homes, would seem to support that as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Joseph Dean</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must correct the assumption that such a thing played a major part in the elections last week. In one of the largest authorities in the country the Conservative Party offered council house tenants in that authority this opportunity and even sent them a form, accompanied by an envelope, which they only had to sign indicating that they could buy houses at 20 per cent. discount. They only had to buy a stamp. That was one city the Conservatives did not take. So I do not think we should draw the conclusions the hon. Member has.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw my conclusion from where I sit—from Crawley New Town. The results there were gratifying, as the hon. Member may know.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not interesting that no less than three hon. Members opposite represent districts which were Socialist until last week, districts which have new towns in them and which have gone Conservative: Preston, Northampton, and Welwyn and Hatfield.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Several hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think we might return to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised at that at all. My hon. Friend's helpful intervention has underlined my few remarks on the point from which I now hasten to pass to come back to dull figures again.<br><br>
The Government would do a better deal in carrying out their policy if they offered tenants the opportunity to buy their own homes. On any figures one looks at, it must be cheaper for a council,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0456">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 145</span>
once it has control of new town houses, to offer tenants the opportunity to buy their homes, and with the money received by the council it could carry on a substantial building programme.<br><br>
The proportion which rent pays of the administrative cost, cost of debt and of repairs, is about 25 per cent. in Crawley. So I suggest that there would be significant advantages if tenants were offered the opportunity to buy their own homes, because there would be an immediate saving in the cost of administration and repairs.<br><br>
What would be much more substantial would be the income which the local authority would receive from the sale of those assets. I am suggesting—I have no hard formula for this suggestion—that assets could be sold at 20 per cent. below current market value. If this were done the council would receive substantially more money than it receives or has any prospect of receiving from rents now, and on such a scale that it would be able, by advancing mortgages at the current building society rate, to recover sufficient funds to carry on a building programme of its own which must be substantially larger than it might do, under present prospects, from the rents it is now receiving. My figures are those I mentioned in the Second Reading debate, and I do not want to weary the Committee with them again. It is certainly the case that if such an arrangement were made and the local authority were permitted to offer mortgages at the going market rate for a house offered for sale at 20 per cent. below current market value, that would enable the authority to proceed with a substantial building programme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the first part of the hon. Member's speech, when he pointed out that rents paid by council tenants are not economic in paying for housing. I take it that he and both of the parties still regard housing as a social service and do not envisage building houses by the council in the majority of cases, in such a way that rents are exactly economic. That would be contrary to Conservative and Labour policies in the past.<br><br>
On his second point about selling houses, saving money and going on to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 146</span>
build houses to diminish, and we hope to abolish, waiting lists, that would be most uneconomic in respect of houses built in recent years—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think an intervention is becoming a speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Mr. Bonner Pink. Is it not true that since houses are more expensive to build than they were, this increased scale of house building would make the financial difficulties greater?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would make no difference, because the position would be precisely the same whether the houses were built with money received from the tenants—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Increased charges and loan charges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There cannot be any difference. Let me say what the scale of it would be. If in Crawley, where the houses are valued at £10,000 each, they were offered at 20 per cent. discount, the price would be £8,000. The income the local authority would receive from that money would be £18.30 a week. It would have no cost of repairs or administration to cover. That figure compares with £6 a week from rent, which is only £3, because repairs and administration have to be taken into account. So that it will be seen that the income the council would receive and the increase in cash flow would allow, at Crawley, an increased number of houses to be built for further rent. This is a mathematical calculation, with no subtlety. It is obvious to even my mean intelligence that that would be the case.<br><br>
The argument is often adduced by the Labour Party that if council houses were offered the total stock of housing would be diminished. That is a powerful argument, but the increase in the number of houses the council would be able to build outweighs it.<br><br>
It is interesting to note the number of houses which come on offer by tenants leaving council houses. In Crawley, as an average over the last five years, 80 of such tenancies have become free out of 3,000 council-owned houses. That proportion, I suggest, is typical over the country as a whole. There is no significant reason why more should become
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0457">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 147</span>
available because they happen to be in other parts of the country than in Crawley, but I put it to the Labour Party that that figure is miniscule and it is not a problem with which we have to contend. The number of council houses which become available because tenants leave is small. The reason is obvious. Council tenants cannot afford to leave their houses because they know that their rents are so heavily subsidised by the community.<br><br>
In the case of newer tenants, this is perfectly understandable, but I refer to tenants who have lived in councils or New Town Commission houses for many years, and in Crawley for as long as 20 years or more. In Crawley 4,000 rent payers, without counting their families, have lived in commission houses for 20 years or more, and another 7,500 for at least 15 years. These people will, as things are, have to face the prospect of paying ever-increasing rents for houses which originally cost much less than they would cost today.<br><br>
That is the only prospect they face. There is no practical choice for them. They cannot escape higher rents, simply because the expansion of the town must go ahead and there is no other prospect on grounds of equity for those who have lived in those houses for many years and have paid substantial rents over those years. They should be offered the opportunity to buy their own homes, to be able to create for themselves an asset which would allow them to choose where they want to live when they leave those homes.<br><br>
They are, therefore, in a real sense a captive population, incapable of moving from their houses—and, I regret, an ageing population in Crawley New Town, less and less capable of providing the work force which new town expansion demands. That is certain to continue as long as this expansion goes on and the average age becomes higher as well. I refer to remarks by a Socialist, Mr. Field—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Hon. Members</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: —Mr. Frank Field, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is a growing sourness on the housing estates themselves as tenants become more and more aware of the serfdom imposed upon them by their council tenancies."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 148</span>
That might be regarded as strong language, although Socialists are used to strong language. I should not have put it as strongly as that, but there is little prospect of manoeuvre for tenants who have lived in their houses for a long time in the new town.<br><br>
My conviction is that they should be given the opportunity which they need to buy their own homes and build an asset for themselves—but not if they do not want to. I cannot understand how the Government can turn down the proposal in the amendment, since they must know that, on any mathematical basis they would like to examine, it must be for the better and get into the hands of the council more funds with which it could produce a better housing programme than it can at present. The present course is bound to lead to disaster in one way or another. Either council tenants will have to pay substantially higher rents, or the building programme will grind to a halt. Those are the only options which remain.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member has made a number of interesting points which are worth taking up. I would like to take him back—sorry, Mr. Bonner Pink—to the amendment. The preliminary objection to it is that it forces local authorities to offer houses for sale, whereas at present local authorities have to make up their own minds. I made that point at the beginning. The hon. Member has made the point about people living in commission houses, elderly gentlemen about my age or a little older.—[Hon. Members: "Shame!"]—Let us put them a little older—at 55. These elderly gentlemen—and ladies—of 55 or over who have lived in these houses for a long time, 20 years or more, are not good mortgage prospects for a 20 or 25 year period. They would be pushing 80 by the time the mortgage were to come in. So if the hon. Member for Horsham and Crawley (Mr. Hordern) can tell us how to get mortgages for them, many people outside this place would be glad to know.<br><br>
My second point about them is that when they were somewhat younger, between 1970 and 1974, they had the opportunity to buy their houses, because that was then Conservative Government policy. Why did they not do so?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0458">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 149</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, noticed the Minister's remark about local authorities being forced to offer houses for sale, but I interpret it in quite a different way. I think that local authorities are forced at present to exclude tenants from the right to buy their own homes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That is not the case.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that is not the case, Labour councils up and down the country are saying that they have no right nor desire to offer their houses to their tenants. There are many councils under the impression that they cannot offer their houses for sale.<br><br>
It seems to me that to create a right for a tenant to buy his house if he wishes to do so is to transfer the option from the council to the tenant. Surely this is what democracy is all about. Grass roots democracy is the transference of power away from the council to the tenant. I thought that was the sort of thing which the Labour Party supported.<br><br>
The second point the Minister made was that there were a number of elderly tenants who would be stretched to take out a mortgage. I do not deny that for a single moment, but these tenants would have liked to have had the right to buy their own homes for a much longer period than the time that was available to them while the Conservative Party was last in office.<br><br>
The third point the Minister made was, why did these people not take the opportunity to buy their houses when the Conservatives were in office? I do not know whether he has had an opportunity to look at the figures, but in Crawley New Town, in three years of Conservative Government, 2,300 houses were, in fact, bought by tenants at a time when about 9,000 houses were owned by the New Towns Commission. In three years, a substantial number of houses was bought by those who sat on the Socialist Council at that time. They recognised it as a good investment, and I am only sorry that they have not seen fit to offer to others the same opportunities as they took advantage of themselves. This policy should have continued when the Labour Party came into office, and by not continuing it Labour are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 150</span>
making the prospects for tenants, and the building programme in Crawley and other new towns up and down the country, far more difficult than otherwise would have been the case.<br><br>
On their own arguments and definitions of what the objectives should be—the provision of houses where there are long waiting lists—the Government are failing to measure up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to follow the point I made but ought not to have made in my intervention just now. It is a question of council housing stocks. We all know that in the 1930s and in the later 1940s when a lot of council houses were built they were let very cheaply. Interest charges were low at the time—about 2½ per cent.—and in the period of Labour Government after the Second World War they were kept purposely low. Labour was cheap and land was relatively cheap although it became increasingly expensive. For that reason councils had stocks of cheaply built houses which helped them to keep rent levels down.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is perfectly true that when these houses were built tenants were paying what now appears to be a low rent, but at that time it represented a much higher proportion of the cost of building and running the houses than rents constitute today.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman the Member for Horsham and Crawley (Mr. Hordern) has missed the point. I said that because this stock of cheap houses belongs to the council it helps to keep rents lower because there is a general evening out of rents.<br><br>
The cost of housing, which has gone up rapidly in recent years, is something which has burdened councils and their tenants. That has been largely because in this country we have had higher interest rates than most others, because of our national difficulties. It is unfair to load the tenants of the future with unnaturally high costs because our interest charges are unnaturally high, and this is what we would be doing if we replaced cheaply built houses with houses built now. Land in this country is becoming even scarcer and land costs are also unnaturally high. If we are going to sell the stock of relatively cheap houses, and replace them with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0459">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 151</span>
relatively expensive houses, it will make the rents higher than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hordern</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can it be any more expensive to build houses for rented accommodation, if they are being paid for by rents, than it would be to pay for them out of the cash flow emanating from the sale of houses?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We should try to keep rents as low as possible. If we have houses built more cheaply rather than more expensively it is possible to keep the rents low.<br><br>
Housing is a social service. I regard it as the most important social service of all, more so than education even, because in improving houses we are improving the community. We are enabling children to benefit from the educational service and we are preventing a large drain on the National Health Service. Therefore, the housing service is basic. In helping the deprived section of the community, we must keep rents relatively low, so that poorer families are able to grow up in decent conditions. If we go in for building large numbers of houses in the expensive situation in which we find ourselves today, and get rid of our cheap houses, the situation will get worse.<br><br>
Hon. Members opposite have spoken of the desire of tenants to own their own houses. I have found, on the doorsteps when I have been asked very occasionally about our policy on buying council houses, that as soon as I have told people the market price for their houses they lost interest. Many tenants imagine that they can buy their houses for very small amounts indeed. When I tell them the price they realise that it is beyond their capabilities.<br><br>
The Conservatives are overlooking the importance of a large stock of rented accommodation. They want to diminish it. Many younger families, who need relatively large council houses, find that when their families have gone they need only small houses. Then there are single people, old couples, or old single people, who find it very difficult to stay in the houses they originally had. That happens to private householders, too. One old man begged me to get him a council house because he could not keep his own four-bedroomed house and its garden going. He wanted to get into a bed-sitter as he was nearing the age of 80, but he could not get that sort of accommodation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 152</span>
Council tenants are not like the residents of Eaton Square who can afford to maintain their establishments when their children have grown up and gone elsewhere. Council tenants are very often forced to look for cheaper accommodation. From the industrial point of view, also, it is important to have a large stock of rented houses to encourage mobility of labour.<br><br>
I appeal to the Opposition not to assume, in doctrinaire fashion, that a large supply of rented accommodation is a bad thing for the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did his profession less than justice, and he did me less than justice, as he did not attempt to answer the questions I raised in my earlier intervention. I do not have the advantage of legal training, but I cannot see in our amendment any compulsion of local authorities.<br><br>
We are trying to preserve for tenants in new towns the right they had on entering the new town to buy their houses. We have provided a period of six months after the transfer to make certain that there will be time for completion of these purchases. I would be grateful if the Minister would tell us whether he has any information about the numbers of tenants who had such right on entering new towns. He has told us that only a quarter of tenants wish to buy the houses they are actually in. Well, that is not such a despicable figure. In fact it is roughly equivalent to the number of people who voted Labour in the last election. There are people who had a right to buy their houses when they first took them over; then the Government decided, for one reason or another, that that right should be suspended for a period because of the balance. The Chairman of the New Towns Commission now thinks that that balance is in danger of going too much the other way. Our amendment is to restore the rights to those tenants before the matter passes out of the Minister's control.<br><br>
No one is compelling anyone to do anything. All we are trying to do is ensure that tenants have the right to buy their houses if they wish to do so and we have provided a period of six months after the transfer, just in case the purchases have not been completed before the transfer actually takes place.<br><br>
This is a question of people's rights. We are not creating some sort of municipal apartheid as has been suggested. We are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0460">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 153</span>
trying to get back to the position as it was originally, and restore the balance which was so desirable.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been a little lenient with the Committee on this amendment. There are other amendments still to be called to this clause. At the moment I have some doubts whether debate on the Question, That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill, would be appropriate, judging by the way the debate has gone so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows that I have been tracking his actions on the sale of new town houses since I arrived in this honoured place. I can certainly agree that he has been consistent over that time, even if the results of his policy have not worked out He has disagreed with that this morning, but on reflection he might admit that it would be wrong for any of us to suggest that the housing problem was easier in 1964 than it was in 1974. In 1964 the problems of the inner city areas were desperate. Although it may have been a record year for housing, by any standard it was a different scene from that of 1974.<br><br>
What has happened in the period since the right hon. Gentleman issued his initial letter? It was a strange way of informing the bodies concerned to stop selling. Subsequently there came his directive. What has happened is that there were building delays in the latter half of 1974 and early 1975 and some slowing down in construction. General programmes in a number of new towns, Peterborough, Northampton, Milton Keynes and others, were running behind schedule.<br><br>
The waiting lists that have come down in the subsequent period have not come down because of any new building that has gone on as a result of a transfer of land from the originally designated public sector to the private sector. That land has not yet been built on. The right hon. Gentleman knows that as well as I do. There may be houses in the process of being built, but they are not completed. It is beyond the powers of comprehension, bearing in mind what my hon. Friend the Member for Horsham and Crawley (Mr. Hordern) said regarding the evidence that the proportion of voids is very low, that there would have been any
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 154</span>
significant increase in the number of voids to bring down the waiting list. The waiting lists have come down, and we are all very glad they have come down, but this is not because of the right hon. Gentleman's actions, but rather because of a change of economic circumstances in the towns: the jobs are not there. There was also a substantial pipeline. That is to the credit of both parties. The Department of the Environment has encouraged it.<br><br>
I hope, however, that we can get an understanding on the significance of voids. All the evidence we have is that the percentage of voids is low. The vast majority of people who buy tend to stay in their own homes, and tend to stay for a period of time. We hope that the proportion of 53 per cent. will grow. I accept that the Labour Party hopes to see it grow, though it may not encourage this as much as we do. We know that such people look after their homes better. They are a smaller charge in terms of maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says We all know that people who own their own houses look after those houses better than those who rent them. We do not all know it. There is no evidence of that whatever. I cannot think of any evidence produced to that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the right hon. Gentleman does not think that is the case, but I would ask him to contact the leaders of local authorities and others who have been chairmen of housing committees. The proportion who look after their own homes well in the private sector is far higher than that of those who live in the public sector.<br><br>
I come back to the particular situation of Northampton. The right hon. Gentleman must know that the chairman, until recently, of that development corporation was a very respected member of the Greater London Council. The late chairman, Sir William Hart, a Labour Party man and an extraordinarily good chairman, was also in favour of selling. His board was in favour of selling, and it included the leader of the Labour majority, another key Labour member, the two key Conservatives. The housing managers wanted to sell and the tenants wanted to buy. It reflects badly on Westminster when we have local knowledge, across party lines, saying it is right that tenants should be given the opportunity to buy, and yet the Secretary of State refuses to move on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0461">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 155</span>
this matter. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman believes in local democracy and yet he resists that sort of pressure.<br><br>
There are great financial benefits in terms of ploughing back money. We would do well, when times are difficult, to reflect on how we can plough back money to the benefit of those who are in need.<br><br>
Finally, I come to the right hon. Gentleman's credibility on this matter. As he has said, owner-occupation stands at 53 per cent. We all of us look to the future and hope that it will soon be something in the order of 60 per cent. It certainly does not help any new town to keep it down at the A5 per cent. to 30 per cent. ratio that some of the old new towns have. Nor does it help the newer, second-generation towns to try to bring down the overall percentage of owner-occupation.<br><br>
The whole basis of the right hon. Gentleman's philosophy seems to be based on the question of the waiting list. I respect his reasoning, though I disagree with his past policies. When the waiting lists are next to nothing, and when the local people want the selling policy in any case, it is not too much to ask the right hon. Gentleman to say "I will continue to be consistent, now that the waiting lists have gone, and I will allow the sale of new town houses". If he does not do that, then the entire credibility of his policy becomes very suspect. Now that we have reached the happy state that we wanted to reach, of next to no waiting lists, he will, perhaps, take the opportunity this morning, or at least in the House, to make a statement that he will allow selling, at least in those areas where his policy has been met.<br><br>
On that basis I hope my hon. Friends will join us in pressing this amendment to a Division. It is a sound amendment, and one which we know the people want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Bonner Pink, I bear strongly in mind your very reasonable injunction to us to stick to the point, but I am in the slight difficulty that even in the last two speeches there have been matters which are not strictly germane to the amendment. I will go over them as quickly as I can, though I must try to relate them to the amendment, to see whether I can answer them.<br><br>
Dealing first of all with the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller), he may not have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 156</span>
heard me, but I did mention him in my wind-up speech.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I heard the mention but not the figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because the figures simply do not exist. The hon. Gentleman—and I put this to him, because he is a reasonable man—is on to a very bad point. What he is asking is what has happened to those who bought houses during the right-to-buy period of 1970–1974. What are the figures, and are we not taking something away from them? There may have been people who were tenants before that period who were also planning to buy a house. There may be people who have come in afterwards who hope to buy a house at a later time. I do not think one can single out one section of people. Neither I, nor the new towns, have the figures.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman talked about costs. I know he will understand this. One cannot compare the Parker Morris standards with the NHBRC standards. They are two different animals. Parker Morris standards deal basically with size and certain amenities inside. NHBRC standards deal with structure. The fact that one comes under one category but not under the other does not necessarily give one a real standard of comparison.<br><br>
Both the hon. Gentleman the Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) made the same point, but again I say that the terms of the amendment talk about putting a duty on a local authority after transfer. It may not have been meant. This is so bad an amendment anyway that that may not be what the hon. Gentlemen intended, but it is what it says. The basis of it is that, after transfer, the local authorities in which the new towns are situated will be given a duty which does not exist in the case of other authorities. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) attempted to justify that. He said "We are trying to relate it to this Bill and because this Bill is handy, we happen to be putting it in here". He disagrees with his hon. Friends.<br><br>
The important point which both hon. Gentlemen raised was that of waiting lists and houses to rent and how the two are affected. I do not know whether it is germane to the amendments, but perhaps
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0462">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 157</span>
it comes in by a side wind. In 1973, which was the last year of Conservative rule, only 8,200 dwellings were included in new contracts placed. By 1975, in the last 12 months of the Labour Government, this figure had almost doubled to 16,000. We are beginning to see this increased rate of approvals translated into an increased number of new houses completed. The hon. Gentleman said it was not so, but it is so. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) cannot have any responsibility for it—I acquit him of it—but under the Conservative Government in 1973 fewer than 7,000 houses were added to the new towns' rented stock. The figure in 1975 is 11,500, and we had to build up from this very low base. It is making a difference, and this is the whole point of the exercise.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asks me to keep the position under review in the new towns. Of course I will. Of course I am. But I will certainly not be panicked, one way or the other, by an extremely illiterate amendment, put down by the Opposition in a moment of haste, in a totally irrelevant Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure if the Bill is adjudged to be totally irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Irrelevant to the hon. Members' point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being disingenuous about the duty on local authorities. The amendment says there shall be a right to purchase the dwellings
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that they complete the purchase within six months of the transfer of housing assets from the relevant New Town Corporation having taken place."</p></blockquote>
We made it quite clear that it was not our intention to try to impose a long-term duty on local authorities to sell houses, but to use the business of a transfer as a moment when sale to sitting tenants could take place.<br><br>
As I have said again and again, the reason we talk of a six-months' extension is a purely practical one, because it takes a little time to sell houses.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) in his speech last week said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Why do the Opposition think it right that a tenant who buys from a development cor-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 158</span>
poration or local council should receive what is, in effect, a subsidy from the Government"?—OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee H,</i> 4th May 1976; c. 120.]</p></blockquote>
It is reasonable that he should put that question and that he should have an answer. Essentially, it is for two reasons. One is, that it is normal practice in the sale of a house in the private sector for a sitting tenant to have a discount on the price of the sale. It is recognised that a sitting tenant is somebody who has an effect on the market value of the house. Frankly, the major reason for it is that we think it is a socially desirable thing that people should have the chance to own their houses. Because we see it as socially desirable we are prepared to try to encourage it.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) talked about housing as a social service. One could argue about that. If it is a social service, still this is one way of fulfilling a social objective which we believe to make sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stanley Newens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In other words, what the hon. Gentleman is saying is that owner-occupation is such an important objective to be achieved that, in his view, and the view of the Opposition, we would be justified in setting aside large sums of public money in order to promote it at a time when there is a considerable need for tenancies on the part of those who cannot afford to buy. That is what I understand him to be saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There certainly is a financial implication, but I would remind the hon. Gentleman of a point which he and his hon. Friends have consistently overlooked, and that is, that we are talking about selling to a sitting tenant. This is the essence of what we are interested in. It is not for me to discuss the effect on the housing stock which hon. Gentlemen opposite like to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Newens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it saving public expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question which would take a long time to argue. It is a complicated calculation as to whether it is saving public expenditure. After all, there is money coming back in from the sale. However, money

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 159</span>
may have to be provided for mortgage although that will be paid back over a period of time. Most people who have looked at housing finance would say it is a very complicated question as to what the net affect on public expenditure is. There are arguments both ways.<br><br>
The second point which the hon. Member for Harlow made, was:
<br><blockquote><p>"If it is such a good thing, I would like to ask the hon. Member for Aylesbury why we should not then force all landlords, including private landlords, to sell their houses to tenants, and at a 20 per cent. discount. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee H,</i> 4th May 1976; c. 120.]</p></blockquote>
Again, we feel that what we are putting forward is socially desirable, but there is a difference between the public sector, or the State sector or whatever we like to call it, dealing with its own properties and compelling other people to behave in a particular way.<br><br>
It seems quite false to use the phrase, What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, in that context.<br><br>
I would like to reply, for the record, to a point made by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) who at the moment is not here, and who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Member took the trouble to mention four new town authorities that were mentioned in the report to which he referred. Quite by chance those four new towns are in the South-Eastern belt of the country."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee H,</i> 4th May 1976; c. 122.]</p></blockquote>
As it happens, the four new towns were Crawley and Stevenage, and also Aycliffe and East Kilbride which I do not think could be regarded as in the South-East of this country.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman talked about municipal apartheid and said that what we are doing was applying the amendment only to new towns. It must be apparent that the amendment can only deal with new towns in a New Towns (Amendment) Bill. It is no secret that we, as a party, favour the general right to buy. We have made this point on a number of occasions. However, it will come as no surprise to the Minister that, in respect of this Bill, we have to stick to the subject.<br><br>
I cannot go along with him in his further reference to the Cullingworth Report. While it is true that a small
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
proportion would like to buy, the report talks in terms of about 50 per cent. The figures are given on page 134 and show there is a considerable desire among people, particularly in Crawley, and also in Stevenage, but apparently less in Aycliffe and East Kilbride, to buy their present house. We have never said that 100 per cent. of tenants would want to buy. That would be ridiculous. What we do believe is that there is a substantial desire to buy, and we can see no reason to frustrate it.<br><br>
The district elections last week reinforced our point of view, because we made a great deal about the fact that we believed in the right to buy new town houses and council houses. We made a great deal of it in all sorts of ways. We talked about it in the House of Commons on more than one occasion, in party political broadcasts, and in many parts of the country in local campaigns. No one could conceivably argue that this was not a significant part of last week's district election campaign.<br><br>
What happened in the new towns themselves is extremely interesting. I congratulate the hon. Member for Harlow to the extent that Harlow remained under Socialist control. Poor old Harlow. However, the hon. Lady the Member for Northampton, North (Ms. Colquhoun), the hon. Lady the Member for Welwyn and Hatfield (Mrs. Hayman) and the hon. Gentleman the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins), all represent districts where the electorate have now produced Conservative majorities in new town areas where this issue played a prominent part in the elections. Eleven district councils, including new towns, which went over to Conservative rule last week were Bracknell, Chorley, Corby, Dacorum, Milton Keynes, Northampton, Peterborough, Preston, Redditch, Welwyn Hatfield, and West Lancashire. They all went Conservative at the end of the campaign in which the issue of the sale of new town houses and council houses played a prominent part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, particularly since he mentioned Preston. The fact is that council boundaries do not coincide with the boundaries for parliamentary elections, especially in my area. As for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0464">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
Preston, there are no new town houses in that area at all. When the hon. Member talks about an election being fought, it is fought on the whole manifesto, and in Preston, for example, the question of council houses was not an issue. The two chief issues were the loss on the docks and a letter sent by a former Conservative councilor—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think we can continue on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rates was the big issue in my area as I am sure it was in many other areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman says that there are no new town tenants in the Preston area I would not argue with him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very few. There may be 20.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A very small number. But those who represent constituencies or districts will have noted that the new town areas voted clearly at the end of the campaign in which these issues were very prominent. Because people watch television and read the national newspapers, local elections are not just isolated events.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Newens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fear the wrath of the Chair if I give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Newens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman. Will he bear in mind that, generally</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 76, in page 4, line 25, after "person", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"including a housing association or tenants co-operative".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Newens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is it possible to discuss amendment No. 79 in connection with this amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. Amendment No. 79 is out of order because the question</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
<p>speaking, many tenants of new towns voted the other way? For example, in my own new town the Conservatives managed to take just three seats out of 42. One can hardly regard that as a particularly strong expression of support for the view he is expressing this morning.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Can we now leave party politics and come back to the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Raison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Mr. Bonner Pink but it is difficult to conduct any proceedings in Parliament in a totally neutral atmosphere. However, I must not pursue that point.<br><br>
We believe that the principles set out in the amendment are sound although the amendment may be faulty in drafting. Even though I recognise that the Minister himself does not agree with the principle, I would say to him that it is nonsensical to preserve this detailed ban on the sale of new town houses. If he were saying he is not going to allow it to happen everywhere, I would understand that; but there is no reason whatever for continuing this ban totally. I hope he will use this opportunity to say that the ban will be relaxed.<br><br>
I say we must press the amendment to a division.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 9.</p>
<p>of powers has already been discussed and dealt with. The hon. Member may be able to make a few remarks which are in order on this amendment.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I can deal briefly with the amendment. Its purpose is to give the opportunity to transfer properties direct to a tenant co-operative or housing association rather than to a local authority. The situation is that there are a number of what are best termed "ground movements" happening in one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0465">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
or two of the new towns where embryonic tenants' associations are starting. The new town corporations see these embryonic groupings beginning to develop towards fully-fledged tenants' co-operatives. I can see a point in time at which, in the right circumstances, this initial groundwork comes to fruition and where the people in a particular court or estate want to form themselves into a co-operative. There ought to be provision in the Bill for them to be allowed to do so rather than necessarily having to be transferred to the local authority, the local authority then having to go through the process of turning the houses over to the co-operative. There is also a similar situation with regard to some housing associations, where again there are one or two examples of this happening.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
It is worth reminding the hon. Gentleman that his hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Construction has on many occasions on the Floor of the House expressed his desire and that of the Government, to encourage various forms of what is known, in their terms, as social ownership. In a number of debates on housing the Minister has consistently said in particular that he wished to see tenants' co-operatives developed and encouraged and given every possible assistance to grow. Knowing that there are activities happening on the ground—I believe in Stevenage, certainly in Northampton, and I understand there are also developments in Milton Keynes, and there may be others that I do not know about—it seems appropriate to make provision in this Bill that where in the right circumstances this movement is happening these people should be allowed to take over their own homes as a co-operative venture before the properties are transferred to the local authority.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Newens</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I raised previously the question of the right of district councils to nominate tenants of dwellings owned by housing associations or other similar bodies, at present exercised by the development corporations or the commission, and what would happen to those rights in due course. It seems fitting that I should refer to this matter in connection with this debate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
I was concerned with the reply given to me previously by my hon. Friend when he gave me to understand that the Bill did not provide for the transfer of these rights. If we are talking about the desirability of housing associations and co-operatives being created, we would be allowing an unsatisfactory state of affairs to be created in which the rights of development corporations and the commission to nominate would not be transferred.<br><br>
I had hoped that Amendment 80, to Clause 16, with Amendment 79, would have provided a means whereby nomination rights could be transferred. I accept your ruling, Mr. Bonner Pink, that this is out of order. I would argue, however, that the objective which I was seeking in putting down those amendments should in some way be covered by the Bill. I hope my hon. Friend will give further consideration to this matter.<br><br>
Housing associations do not normally erect dwellings without some public help in one way or another, whether by direct financial assistance or having the land allocated to them. It is right that they should accept nominees from public bodies for their tenancies. If a development corporation or the commission is thought to be a reasonable body to make nominations, district councils, to which the much more considerable rights and assets of the commission and development corporations are to be transferred by this Bill, are equally reasonable bodies to make nominations.<br><br>
A very anomalous situation could be created by the omission of the provision I was seeking to insert. The district councils would, as a result of the Bill and this amendment, be able to allocate tenancies of a large stock of transferred accommodation and accommodation built in its own right, but not to make nominations. In these circumstances I think something should be done in the Bill to provide for the transfer of these nomination rights. If we were to allow housing associations or tenants' co-operatives to come into existence there would be an anomalous situation created in the long run when development corporations and the commission go out of existence. One would then ask who would exercise the nomination rights which are at present exercised by the corporations and the commission.<br><br>
This is an important issue which has not yet been covered and, while I apologise
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0466">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
that I have had to raise it oh this amendment, I think my hon. Friend should give consideration to it. I wonder if he would take note that I am still interested in this issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Guy Barnett) </span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I could begin by referring to the point which my hon. Friend has just put before the Committee, though, as he and I admit, it is not strictly within the terms of this amendment. Since he is obviously concerned, and rightly so, I should take up the time of the Committee to speak to that point.<br><br>
The difficulty over bringing this subject into the Bill is that it lies outside the Long Title of the Bill. My understanding of the situation is that though agreements have existed between the new town corporations in some cases and housing associations whereby the new town corporation can exercise nomination of some of the tenancies in the areas of housing associations such agreements do not, in my understanding, amount to any liabilities. This Bill is concerned with the transfer of liabilities, interests, and the rest, as set out in the Bill, from new town corporations to district councils. We are in a bit of difficulty here. This is the reason why, even if we wanted to, it would be impossible at this stage to include this in the Bill. It therefore could not be done, and would make the amendments my hon. Friend wanted to move unacceptable.<br><br>
Nevertheless my right hon. Friend and I are fully aware of the problem of corporations' nomination rights over a housing association's dwellings, and we are looking into the best means of dealing with it. An official working group, comprised of local authority and new town association representatives is currently examining the transfer scheme-making process and has had some initial discussion on this point. The Government's preliminary view is that the issue might best be dealt with through administrative advice from the Department. This might specify that joint consultations should take place between the local authority, new town corporation and housing association to make suitable local arrangements either for the district council to take over the nomination rights after a transfer scheme in respect of the new town corporation's dwellings has come into
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
operation or suggest net provision be made by the parties to the transfer scheme by which the determination of the extent of the nomination rights over the district council's stock which are to be exercised by the corporation will take into account the fact that a proportion of the corporation's needs is met through nomination rights over housing association dwellings.<br><br>
I turn to the amendment which has been moved. I realised only about five minutes ago, and I think I am correct, that not a single member of the legal profession sits on the Benches opposite. Not many sit on our side. The fact that this is so—and it appears to be so because no one has denied it, and we have had lots of protestations from hon. Members opposite that they have had no legal training—might account for the fact that this amendment has been moved. A lawyer would have told them, and they have told me, that, in legal language, a person can mean a thing and an individual can mean a person because a person can mean a thing. It could, therefore, presumably mean a company. What I am arguing is that this amendment is quite unnecessary. As the Bill at present drafted refers to "person" that word "person" could include "housing co-operative" or "housing association", or however one wants to describe the body one is talking about. The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) used the terms "tenants' co-operative" and "housing association".<br><br>
This amendment, if it were made, could only cause difficulty, because, it may be, there is good reason to believe that many people, if not all parties, may settle down with the term "housing co-operative". It does not happen to fall within the terms of the amendment. One could imagine the sort of difficulties which could arise if we were to settle on this term as opposed to others. I suggest it is likely that we should do so because it has been used in Government papers of one kind or another.<br><br>
Since this subject has come up it would not be unreasonable for me to mention the fact that the Government have an interest, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, in the development of the housing association movement and see every advantage in giving that encouragement. I would refer the Committee to the Department's Circular 8 of 1976 and to the New Town Circular 441 of 31st March. That circular specifically referred to the existence of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0467">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
Bill we are debating and emphasised that local authorities to which housing will be transferred will have an interest in any proposals for setting up co-operatives. We have asked development corporations to keep the local authorities fully informed of any proposals and to give the local authorities the opportunity to comment on them before they are submitted for approval. We have taken this advice a little further in relation to those towns where early transfer of the rented housing stock is likely. Here we have specifically asked that any proposals for housing co-operatives should be agreed with the local authority before submission.<br><br>
At any rate, I hope the Committee will understand and accept from me that this amendment is not necessary. I hope that the Opposition will not make a mistake in believing that we ought to encourage a large amount of transfer of property to housing associations at present rather than allow decisions of this kind to be made by the democratically elected local authority which will take over the housing assets in general.<br><br>
It would be wrong to encourage last minute initiatives by development corporations to transfer property to housing associations or whatever we call them. Much better, surely, that the district council can plan its housing policies, whichever political party may happen to be in control at the time, and that the democratically elected district council can make its decisions after the transfer has taken place. There is every possible reason for wanting to see encouragement of development of the movement, in which I know the hon. Gentleman is interested, after the transfer has taken place.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for clarifying the fact that the amendment is not necessary because what we seek can be done within the confines of the Bill as it is. I shall not go further except to say, in view of his last remark, that none of us seeks any form of last minute initiatives, but equally we would want to see carefully safeguarded the situation where an amount of preliminary work has been done and tenants want it to happen but a backward local authority does not and nips it in the bud as it is coming to fruition. I understand that he would like to be encouraging, so I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
am hopeful that when a circular comes out there will be a degree of encouragement. With that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 53, in page 4, line 39, leave out "subject to" and insert "which is the subject of".ߞ[<i>Mr. Guy Barnett.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 28, in page 4, line 43, after "a", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"ordnance survey or approved development corporation".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Amendment No. 36, in Clause 5, page 8, line 31, after first "the", insert "approved".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Under-Secretary points out that there might be some legal inconsistency between these amendments I plead ignorance in legal matters and also stress that the intention is merely to obtain some clarification as to what sort of maps and plans will be involved. The reason is simple. We referred in an earlier amendment to the need to associate county councils with these transfers, and I alluded to the separation of planning powers between county councils and district councils. No doubt the Minister will have seen the views of the Association of District Councils and the Association of County Councils on this point.<br><br>
When we were talking about this map here, we were just trying to find out the type of map which might be used for this purpose, and to avoid any conflict, for instance, between the development corporation plan and the county structure plan or map. This occasioned some discussion in my new town and I had discussions on it with the Ministry.<br><br>
I would be grateful, even if our words in the amendment are not acceptable, if the Minister could enlighten us on what is intended, and assure us that what is intended will be effective, and free from some of the possibilities which I have mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could dispose of this matter quickly. I realise that the hon. Member is simply seeking information, some of which I am not sure I am in a position to give him. As he expected, there are difficulties about the amendment.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0468">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
First, it is most unusual to have a statutory requirement about a particular kind of map.<br><br>
Secondly the term
<br><blockquote><p>"approved development corporation map"</p></blockquote>
which appears in the amendment is, I am told, a term which is not obvious or clear in meaning and would only serve to confuse. As he may subsequently have realised, the amendment has been tabled to the wrong reference to a map in the text of the Bill, which means that the amendment in general is rather defective.<br><br>
Nevertheless I realise the purpose for which it has been proposed. The only information I can give the hon. Gentleman, and which might help him, is that the map is part of the scheme and the scheme has to be approved by the Secretary of State. Therefore, whatever map is used would have to be approved by my right hon. Friend when approving the scheme. So the hon. Member can take it from me that a map will be reasonably clear and acceptable to the county councils and other authorities which may be involved, and will indicate precisely what the transfer involves. I hope there is no other technical difficulty which the hon. Member can think of which is likely to arise. If there were it would be a matter for my right hon. Friend to make a decision on in his approval of the scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise from the Minister's remarks that it has not been possible for his Department to carry through its investigations to such an extent that it can specify a map which will be useful, but I hope that the Minister has taken on board the fact that there is a possibility of difficulty and that he will seek to remove that difficulty if possible. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 30, in page 5, line 1, at end insert "numbers of".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Amendment No. 31, in page 5, line 5, after "dwellings", insert "by size".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a much more serious matter. The drafting may cause some concern to the Ministry, but I shall explain my intention and the serious considerations which underlie the amendment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
I have already had occasion to remark on the need to ensure that industry is still attracted to the newer new towns and that industry in the older new towns will grow. The hon. Lady the Member for Welwyn and Hatfield (Mrs. Hayman) has drawn our attention in a sympathetic manner to the special categories of people who need to be catered for in the new towns, such as parents of residents, and the Minister has referred to the need to ensure that a proportion of handicapped and other disadvantaged people are housed in new towns. I have myself spoken of the need to provide for second generation families from private owner-occupied and rented accommodation, so we are dealing with a real point. It has been referred to in most of the documentation dealing with the question of transfer.<br><br>
I should like to remind the Minister of those remarks which he will find in some of the representations made by the Association of District Councils, in the report of the Stevenage Working Party, in his own Department's consultative document in December 1975, and in the comments of the new towns chairmen. All of these sources have drawn close and detailed attention to provide some continuing basis of nomination. What is not certain is the basis on which that provision should be continued, and the timing. The clause makes provisions for such period to be specified, together with the number of or proportion of dwellings.<br><br>
To make my second amendment first, we would say that the proportion of dwellings should be stated by size, because of the need to cater for elderly parents, one-parent families, and other disadvantaged categories to which I have referred. That is the least difficult part of our proposals, and one which should meet the general wishes of both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
On the question of nomination of tenants, particularly of key workers for industries, and for parents and other groups, I am not clear whether, in our amendment, we ought to specify numbers as such, because I do not think, on reflection, that we should be able to deal with it on a once-for-all basis. I should like to pick up a suggestion made by one of the sources to which I have referred, that this would have to be dealt with on a continuing basis; and perhaps there should be a regular periodical review between the corporation and the local authority,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0469">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 171</span>
because the corporations are still charged with the task of developing their new towns, and have a right to nominate tenants as an essential part of their programme for that development<br><br>
District councils come under immense pressure, not least from hon. Members on both sides, to do this or that with regard to housing policy, and there will be a severe temptation to provide priority for local needs rather than for the objectives for which the new town was established. I realise that in the case of a partnership new town, such as that for which the hon. Members for Northampton are responsible, there are, perhaps, agreed objectives, but in other new towns there are not mutually agreed objectives between the corporation and the local authorities, although attempts have been made to improve the measure of commonality of objectives by the establishment of liaison committees and the appointment of members from the councils to the corporation board.<br><br>
At the risk of straying out of order I might reflect that five out of seven recent appointments to the Redditch board were Socialists, which is by no means the political composition of the Redditch Council. They are dealing with the problem of fulfilling the objectives of the new town and the role which nomination rights have to play in fulfilling those objectives.<br><br>
I do not think the provision in the clause is adequate for the purpose when it states that a transfer scheme shall:
<br><blockquote><p>"confer on the new town corporation a right to nominate tenants of dwellings of the district council (whether transferred or not and including those managed by the council under management arrangements) and specify the number or proportion of dwellings in respect of which the right is so conferred and, where it is so conferred on the Commission for the New Towns, the period for which it is to be exercisable".</p></blockquote>
We have to provide clearer guidance. Perhaps the Minister has already considered this point and has something to tell us about the guidance to be given or the administrative direction which he has in mind. Without some such clarification there will be very grave difficulties.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I refer to the suggestion that this will not be possible on a once-for-all basis. There will be a need for a review, and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 172</span>
it will be difficult to pin it down to a specific number which should hold good for the whole period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) has said in explaining the amendments. I am inclined to think that he may be making difficulties where in fact none exists. Of course, I accept what he says about the need for Redditch and other new towns to continue to accept into their rented housing accommodation key workers for industry, parents of residents, and handicapped and disabled people, so that these towns can get the workers they need to maintain their industry, and in some respects become more balanced communities, and take their share of the less advantaged members of our national community. There is no difference between the two sides of the Committee on this point, and I am glad that the hon. Member has confirmed his support of our intention within the Bill.<br><br>
He has proposed the amendment presumably because he thought that there would not be, on the basis of the Bill as drafted, a clear enough right on the part of the new town corporation to nominate the categories of people for housing transfer to the district council.<br><br>
On the basis of paragraph (<i>b</i>) of this subsection I cannot agree that there is any difficulty. In fact, I would have thought that amendment No. 30 would have precisely the opposite effect from that which the hon. Member wants. If the words "numbers of" are inserted, the only interpretation I can put on that is that the new town corporation should only be able to say "These are the numbers of people we want to house", and the actual choice of people should rest with the district council. Obviously both the hon. Member and I would want to enable the new town corporation to nominate individuals whom they wish to see come into the new town—the key workers, the relatives of residents, the handicapped and disabled people they want to see housed in their area.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman may be creating difficulties about nomination rights. I do not know what experience he has in areas like mine, but in my constituency the situation has been for some years that the GLC has had nomination rights for housing, and we have a far greater housing problem than that which exists in Redditch.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 173</span>
I do not think there has been in my constituency any difficulty which has arisen as a consequence of the nomination rights existing.<br><br>
I shall have to ask the Committee to reject this amendment and Amendment No. 31 which is being taken with it. The reason for rejecting Amendment No. 31 is that the corporation has obviously no means of knowing, at the time of the transfer scheme being prepared, the size of the households of incoming workers and the size of their requirements. It would make a very rigid transfer scheme if one tried to write something like that into it.<br><br>
I hope that in the light of what I have said and the assurances I have given the hon. Member will be prepared to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Under-Secretary for the way in which he has replied, and I admit I did find myself in some difficulty when I was tabling the amendments. Some of my remarks were, indeed, out of sympathy with the amendments as actually drafted but the intention behind them is to try to pinpoint whether the corporations, under the clause as it stands, and under the wording in paragraph (<i>b</i>), would have the right to nominate the number of tenants they wish at any given time.<br><br>
In other words, is this an unlimited right? If it is unlimited it will pose very severe difficulties for district councils. I wish to probe further into the official mind, if not into the ministerial mind, as to what is envisaged here. We need to grapple with this matter of whether the right of the corporation is to be unlimited or if it is to be limited, how it is to be limited. Is there to be any possibility for review? If there are any numbers specified in the transfer scheme will there be a possibility of a later review as the new town matures or as new needs arise? A new need might arise, for example, if a highly labour intensive industry suddenly came to the town. That is why I suggest that we need the possibility of a review or a modification to take account of developments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Member's attention to line 5 of page 5
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
where it says that
<br><blockquote><p>"the number or proportion of dwellings in respect of which the right is so conferred".</p></blockquote>
That should make it clear that there will be included in transfer schemes the number or proportion of dwellings for which a new town corporation will have nomination rights.<br><br>
The hon. Member asks whether the number or proportion will be subject to review. In general I do not think that will be necessary. We are, after all, talking about the transfer of completed housing estates in new towns at the stage in practically every case where the new town has already reached maturity or near maturity. Clearly, in the situation where new towns will be accepting the categories which the hon. Member and I have been talking about, the nomination role of the new town corporation will be less important. The clause as it stands recognises a period in which this role will be exercisable. I do not think that in normal circumstances one would, therefore, talk in terms of a review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to suggest that the Minister has not understood the problem. I accept the blame for failing to get my point across. I think we do need to delay a little on this matter.<br><br>
We are not dealing with developed towns, because we are talking about the need to provide the transfer of housing estates as they are completed, and such a situation envisages that the town is still developing.<br><br>
The more important point is that in practical experience in Redditch—and I cannot, with any authority, speak for other new towns—the corporation has found that relets amount to one-third of its tenancies, and it is highly dependent on these relets for bringing in nominated workers as more industry comes into the town. It is seriously concerned that if there is to be no provision for review the proportion and number of dwellings specified might not be adequate for the needs, because no one can tell in advance what the needs will be. For example, if British Leyland came into Redditch as has been mooted that would bring in a large number of workers, but if there were just a replacement of the facility existing at Longbridge, eight miles away,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0471">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 175</span>
then there would be no new workers. The needs do vary and, therefore, we need flexibility and review.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see how I can help the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller). There is no earthly reason why a district council should not house industrial workers on its own account. Key industrial workers coming from outside a new town do not have to be nominated by the new town corporation. As I have said before, my own authority which has housing problems enough, is actively planning ways in which key workers can be brought into the constituency to provide for the needs of industry. I hope that nobody believes that the sole responsibility for the categories we have been discussing lies with the new town corporation. In other areas throughout the country district councils make provisions for people other than those with residential qualifications.<br><br>
The second point I should make, to correct an impression I may have given before, is that, in exceptional circumstances, obviously there is a possibility of a variation of the agreement made under this subsection, and the hon. Member will find reference to that in Clause 5 (2). He was correct to refer to the fact that in some cases it will not be the whole of new towns handed over, but just the developing areas of new towns. But just how much possibility will there be in developing areas for housing large numbers of nominees of new town corporations? The argument I put then is similar, whether one applies it to whole towns or whether one applies it to areas that have been transferred individually.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am still not happy about this, despite the Under-Secretary's courtesy in referring me to Clauses 5 (2) and (3) I hoped he would at least have been able to say, in view of the importance the corporations attach to this question, that he will ask them for their further views, or, at least, enable them to be in a position to give us their views on this point. My corporation has been chasing me about it. I would suspect others might have been similarly motivated. If he could assure us that the whole thing has been taken up through his new towns division, and that all chairmen are happy with the provisions of the Bill, I would be happy to accept that, but there is still need for some consultation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 176</span>
here, perhaps leading, as he said, to later variations, or to a direction by the Secretary of State for a variation under Clause 5 (3). Perhaps he will give us an assurance that this is the sort of occasion on which he would be prepared to use that power, if he were shown that this was required by the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will do my best to help the hon. Gentleman. He may be misled by the fact that this subsection is framed in general terms. As he will recognise, the situations in different new towns differ.<br><br>
If his new town corporation is as concerned as he says it is over the issues which he has raised, the right time and place for the new town corporation to be consulted and to express that concern is the time when a transfer scheme is being discussed. This is when, under an earlier part of the Bill, the consultations are taking place between the new town corporation and the district council, and indeed, with the Secretary of State. Ultimately the Secretary of State has to approve the scheme. I have no doubt that the Secretary of State, if he is sensible, will be anxious to examine very closely the arrangements for nomination rights, if any, to see that they are relevant both to the needs of the new town and to the responsibilities which the new town corporation still has to discharge. I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept it from me that that will be the position.<br><br>
The subsection is a generally drafted one because such a variety of situations exists. The right time for the sort of issues raised by the hon. Gentleman to be consulted on, discussed in detail and agreed upon, is when the transfer scheme is under discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman say whether the circumstances I have outlined would be sufficient inducement to the Secretary of State, if he considered it necessary, to issue a direction under Section 5 (3) for a variation of the scheme?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I cannot commit this Secretary of State or any future Secretary of State, but I would have thought it likely, if there were the sort of situation the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, and the hon. Gentleman wants to make representations as the Member of Parliament, if he is still the Member of Parliament for that constituency, and if he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0472">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 177</span>
makes those representations and he turns out to be right, and if his concerns are real ones. It would be impossible for me to predict what a Secretary of State might do. All I am able to tell the hon. Gentleman is what the legislation would permit him to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I have every intention of remaining the Member of Parliament for Bromsgrove and Redditch, and am even greatly encouraged by the recent results.<br><br>
I assure him also that the Corporation has a very real concern about this. I understand that it will be able to raise it again during the consultations for the making of a transfer scheme. I am glad to have that from him. It will have to paddle its own canoe for the moment on that matter.<br><br>
Whilst not expressing complete satisfaction with what I have been able to elicit this morning on this amendment and its associated one, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 54, in page 5, line 3, leave out from "including" to "management" in line 4 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"any which is the subject of".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>—[Mr. John Silkin.]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 32, in page 5, line 15, at end insert "so far as is possible".<br><br>
Would it be in order at the same time to discuss Amendment No. 33, in page 5, line 16, at end insert "or where appropriate redundancy payments"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection—if the Committee is agreeable to that course. Then we will take Nos. 32 and 33 together.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments are in the nature of a marker laid down for the discussion that will ensue on Clause 12, because we on this side of the Committee are not satisfied with the arrangements made for the protection of staff. Having said that, I should make it plain that we are not in favour of an open-ended commitment to staff on the lines of that under local government reorganisation, and which excited so much justifiable wrath and, in some cases, suspicion amongst the ratepayers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
However, we do have a duty to protect the interests of staff, and it is not clear from the Bill that the staff are either getting enough information or, later on, enough protection. There is bound to be some loss of employment if, for example, two housing departments are amalgamated. In the case of the new town it will not merely affect the housing department it will also affect the accounting departments which are dealing with rent, rates, maintenance and so on. It will also effect, in particular, the social welfare department.<br><br>
In many cases the new town corporations, however authoritarian they may have been described, are much more in touch with the wishes and needs of their tenants than many local authorities, by reason of the social welfare staff they have at their disposal. Some have community development officers. These staff will obviously be seriously affected by any transfer. We should like to hear from the Minister what intentions, if any, there are for this form of welfare staff and, in particular, whether it is envisaged that they will disappear, because it might be thought that the town has matured and been transferred; or whether they will remain in their posts and extended to cover all the local authority area. That is far from clear. The staff must be asking themselves these questions, and they will be looking at the transfer schemes to see what the relevant information is. We have realised there must be a limit to the amount of information that can be provided. We have inserted the words "as far as is possible," but we believe there will be redundancies and loss of employment. There may even be complicated questions that engage the minds of civil servants. I speak in no derogatory sense because I have been a civil servant for most of my career, but it is always interesting for one civil servant to prepare the emoluments and status of another. There will be occasions when two blocks of administration merge and some will find themselves in a relatively more junior position than that in which they were before. They may be fearing a consequent diminution of emoluments, if nothing else.<br><br>
It is also evident that some senior officers will have to go. There cannot be two cooks in a kitchen. Nor can there be two chief housing officers in a housing department. There will have to be some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0473">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
provision for premature retirement of officers and senior officers.<br><br>
Looking ahead to Clause 12, we shall be enquiring why there is no reference to Section 260 of the Local Government Act 1972. Reference is made only to Section 24 of the Superannuation Act. In our second amendment we have made reference to
<br><blockquote><p>"or where appropriate redundancy payments".</p></blockquote>
It is not clear that the Staff Commission proposed will have adequate powers.<br><br>
In this clause we are concerned with the transfer scheme and the information to be provided under paragraph (<i>d</i>). We are asking that the maximum amount of information should be made available and that it should include some reference to redundancy payments for those who, as we see it, are bound to be affected by any such transfer. The report of the Stevenage Working Party made specific reference to that point, as did the consultative document.<br><br>
Finally, there was reference in those documents to the need for local authorities to adjust their recruitment policies at the present time, in the light of the knowledge that those transfers would be taking place, that there would be staff coming over from the housing departments of corporations and that there would, therefore, be a need
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 180</span>
to leave some possibility of dovetailing. We would like to hear from the Minister what guidance local authorities have been given about the need not to recruit up to their full establishment, in order to permit this necessary dovetailing, which is consequent on the merger of housing departments.<br><br>
There will be difficulties where the corporation housing departments have been looking after much larger number of houses and consequently have more experience, and perhaps more senior staff, than we would normally find in the housing department of a local authority. This will, again, reflect on the position of senior officers when this dovetailing takes place. Some are bound to go up, some are bound to go in, and some are bound to fall out.<br><br>
I hope when the Under-Secretary replies he will be able to accept the spirit of the amendments, if not their wording, and fore-shadow his intentions when we come to consider Clause 12.</span></p>
