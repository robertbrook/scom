	<div class='title'>MEANING OF "EMPLOYMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND" AND "OCCUPATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND"</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed—(1st April)—</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having re-read the words of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) when he returned to the point which he had raised earlier, as to why the rest of the United Kingdom should be treated differently from Northern Ireland, I think that there is a difference of view here. We believe that the Bill and this clause are aimed at the problems that exist at the moment in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite right, as the right hon. Gentleman says, that a British or foreign firm could discriminate at the moment in advertising for employment and sent to Northern Ireland people who would not be covered by the Bill if the firms were not resident in Northern Ireland. My answer is that this is highly unlikely and we have no examples of this type of blatant discrimination being carried out. If it were, I am sure that the Government would look at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked us to have another look at this point and I am prepared to do that. I am not taking a dogmatic stance, but, having looked at it, I see no reason for any change at this stage and, rather than extend this type of legislation to the whole of the United Kingdom, I should like to see the necessity for such legislation lapse in Northern Ireland. We are introducing it because we are forced to do so at this time. I hope that the Committee will accept that explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for renewing as, of course, I had no doubt that he would,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>482</span>
his assurance about further consideration of this point. When he does so, I should like to suggest that he views it upon the narrower rather than upon the wider scale. Whatever one's preferences might have been and whatever are one's prejudices in favour of United Kingdom legislation full stop, we must accept the fact that this is a Northern Ireland Bill. It is not the intention of my hon. Friends or myself to extend it in any natural sense of the term to the rest of the United Kingdom. We are disturbed by the apparent possibility under the Bill that exactly the practices at which it was aimed, in exactly the same places in which it is aimed at them, might be excluded in the sort of case I was describing when the Committee rose last time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if I may, I should like to direct the right hon. Gentleman's attention to two specific areas, both of which I would claim are Northern Ireland areas. One is the case implied in the wording of this subsection where there will be employment in Northern Ireland in the course of the relevant occupation. The Committee will recall that it was the words "or mainly" in this subsection which sparked off this discussion. That is the first point that I should like the right hon. Gentleman to consider. We have here employment which on the face of it will, at any rate in part, be employment in Northern Ireland which is being exempted, subject to the other circumstances, from the ambit of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is recruitment in Northern Ireland. It seems to me that the substance of the Bill deals with recruitment in Northern Ireland, the selection in Northern Ireland of A rather than B, for reasons which Parliament condemns. Therefore the 	<i>locus delicti</i>—the place of the offence—at which we are aiming is Northern Ireland and my hon. Friends and I are not trying to shift it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While not wishing to press the Minister further at this stage I ask him, when he carries out his promise, to address himself not to the larger question which has gone by, whether this should be a United Kingdom Bill or not, but to the two specific and relatively narrow questions of Northern Ireland application which I have endeavoured to define.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 49 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>483</span>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 50</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>APPLICATION OF ACT TO THE CROWN</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we add this clause to the Bill, would the Minister make a brief reference to subsection (4) (	<i>b</i>), which states that services
	<br><q><p>"'for purposes of a Minister of the Crown or government department does not include service in any office in Schedule 2 (Ministerial offices) to the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 as for the time being in force"?</p></q>
I draw attention to this provision because at a number of earlier stages—my hon. Friends and I have pointed out that the circumstances in which everyone perfectly well understands that discrimination does, will and cannot but take place—I do not say on religious grounds but on political grounds—is wider than a perusal of Part V of the Bill might suggest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I well understand that the new Prime Minister, in considering the staffing of the Northern Ireland Office, may make changes. But in making that hypothesis I am expressing no wish to see old faces depart; better the angels we know than the angels that we know not. So far be it from me to wish anything but long life and happiness to the present incumbent. But if, for the purposes of adjustment somewhere else in the Administration it is necessary to make changes, I am sure that the Prime Minister would rightly have regard to all kinds of personal characteristics other than those directly concerned with ministerial competence or efficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman would, or might, take into account the religion of a person whom he was considering for a particular post in the Government. The Prime Minister might take into account the balance of religious affiliation between the different Ministers, senior and junior, who were to serve in a particular office. I go so far as to say that without doing anything which in my view would be improper, the right hon. Gentleman might take into account the religious balance within his Government or Cabinet as a whole. That is conceivable. It is conceivable by the fact that this subsection appears in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>484</span>
My reason for drawing attention to the matter is that it serves to point out that religious discrimination between two equally qualified persons, on grounds of religion, is not necessarily 	<i>ipso facto</i> against the public interest or undesirable. There are circumstances other than those picked up by Part V, when any reasonable person would say that such discrimination was called for and could be in the public interest. We must always be conscious that by bringing in the law to deal with so difficult a matter as discrimination we are teetering on the edge of self-frustration and of foolish definition, and the attempt to legislate where legislation can bring no benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have therefore used the opportunity in this discussion to throw a spotlight upon the fact that the Minister is exempting himself, his own position and his own employment from the ambit of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause which should not be allowed to pass without some scrutiny by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister clarify the situation regarding "reservist"? There is no mention of "reservist" in the clause. True, on page 33 there are references to
	<br><q><p>"cadet training corps for the time being administered by the Ministry of Defence".</p></q>
Reservists have an important role to play in Northern Ireland. No doubt, the Minister understands the situation, but it is not clear from the Bill—indeed, the word is not mentioned—whether, for the purpose of the clause a member of Her Majesty's Forces includes a person who is serving in the reserves of one of the three branches of our services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) posed the position of the Prime Minister making appointments. If any agency were to look at the current appointments, it could not be claimed that, for instance, the Government were using a quota system. There might be some argument that people were all of one or were of no religion as opposed to another type of religion. Fortunately, Ministers have found in Northern Ireland that we have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>485</span>
been received by both communities with equal approval and they clearly want to carry out the job on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that the purpose of the clause is to exclude the kind of decision which the Prime Minister will make through his Ministers by investigation by this agency. The Government feel that that is right and in consequence I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point raised by the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) on reservists, Clause 50(4)(	<i>a</i>)(	<i>i</i>) says:
	<br><q><p>"the naval, military or air forces of the Crown".</p></q>
That, by its very nature, will also cover reservists as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 50 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clauses 51 and 52 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>APPLICATION OF ACT TO THE POLICE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still have exactly the same query. Clause 53(5) makes a reference to the situation relating to police cadets, but no mention is made in the clause about reserve policemen. Do the contents of the clause apply equally to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to have a penchant for getting out of order in this Committee. What I am about to say may be totally out of order, but I feel that the matter is serious. I have just heard of the death of Brian O'Malley, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Security. Many a time he and I confronted one another both in Committee and on the Floor of the House of Commons. I always found him a courteous and a well informed Minister of that Department. I should like to express my own deep regret at his untimely death and I am sure I am expressing the feelings of my hon. Friends here this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>486</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn briefly to Clause 53 entitled "Application of Act to the police". I am sure that the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) is flexing his muscles on this aspect of the Bill because in the whole controversy surrounding Northern Ireland for the last six or seven years one bone of contention has been the personnel of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Indeed, on one occasion on the Floor of the House of Commons when the question of Northern Ireland was being debated, a member of the Opposition Party declared startlingly—he was completely ill-informed—that one of the reasons for the trouble in Northern Ireland was that we had an entirely Protestant police force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had occasion to interrupt this Member and to point out that that was not so, because in my own police district, for instance, the senior police officer in the Magherafelt RUC station, which is the senior police station for my whole area, is Chief Inspector Frank Flynn. He is a Roman Catholic and a very good and efficient policeman with whom I have had quite a lot of contact. I also pointed out that the then chief officer of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the chief constable, in fact, was Sir Jamie Flannagan, himself a Roman Catholic. This had to be pointed out to dispel the idea that the Royal Ulster Constabulary was a completely Protestant force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would also care to mention that very distinguished police officer in charge of Londonderry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Assistant Chief Constable Frank Lagan. I know him personally, too. He is not in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not see why the agency should be involved in the matter of the police, because in conversation with a senior police officer recently he disclosed that this is one of the things that had been cut out of the questionnaire supplied to those who wished to join the Royal Ulster Constabulary. He says the question of religion is completely cut out. That question is not asked now. I think it is quite wrong that this issue should be introduced now and that we should return to that rather strong bone of contention which always existed so far as the police service was concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>487</span>
I do not want to take up the time of the Committee, but I deprecate that the agency should be employed in this role. I hope the hon. Member for Belfast, West will forgive me—I do not say this in any carping way—when I say that he has certain main points of a speech which he seems to apply to all occasions. We have heard it here, of course, more often. I think he should support what I have to say about the elimination of the police from the provisions of this legislation, and that the idea of cutting out altogether both religious affiliation and political alignment should not be applied to the police, of all people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that everybody will admit that over the past six or seven years the personnel of the RUC has completely changed, and we have now in Northern Ireland, under the control of the police authority what might be termed an entirely new police force. I suggest that the police force, and possibly the UDR also, should be exempt from the provisions of this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop), in putting forward his comments on this clause, has, I believe, unwittingly given full justification for its inclusion. At the outset of his remarks he said that there were misgivings about the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland over many years, and that many people in Northern Ireland thought that the RUC was an exclusively Protestant force. He then went on to list the numbers of Catholics whom he knew who were in a senior position within the RUC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That attitude itself denotes something which we know to be true in Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) in a previous debate referred to members of the Newry and Mourne District Council. He referred to their names and particularly their surnames, which would give an indication that they were followers of a particular religion. If we are ever to create in Northern Ireland a police service which is acceptable to the whole community, I believe that it is of crucial importance that those who are in the police service are seen to be subject to the same laws which govern every other citizen in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that there will be a new police
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>488</span>
Bill in Northern Ireland, which will probably take into consideration many aspects of police discipline, and so on. But this Bill is designed to allay suspicion that there is discrimination in any way against a police constable, or against a senior police officer who may be applying for further promotion within the RUC. For that reason, it is vital that the police in Northern Ireland, under the terms of this clause, should be made amenable to the legislation that will affect every other citizen in Northern Ireland, in both the public and the private sector, and anyone who advocates the exclusion from the terms of this legislation of either the police force or the UDR, as the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) did, must have a reason for seeking to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I considered that it was because of the pressure that came from the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) and those who share his political opinions that this particular question was deleted from the list of questions asked of anyone wishing to join the RUC. It is because of the political and public pressures, particularly on television and in the newspapers, that this question was withdrawn. That is why the RUC is now regarded as a completely indiscriminate force, and if anyone wanting to join it—even if he is a Black Muslim—meets the other standards of height, intelligence, health and so on, he can be employed as a policeman in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster used a very unfortunate choice of words when he said that the RUC had become a completely indiscriminate force. That is one of the reasons why there have been such vehement objections to it. As the hon. Gentleman said, there were suspicions and fears about the religious composition and political affiliations of members of the RUC, and this Bill also takes in political affiliations. The same suspicions and fears exist in relation to members of the UDR. There are many people in Northern Ireland who do not give full support to, nor have sufficient faith in, the UDR as at present constituted. That is why it is all the more necessary that this clause be included in the Bill, to allay suspicions where they are groundless, where there are fears to prove that they are unfounded, and to ensure that everyone in Northern Ireland—irrespective of religious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>489</span>
or political affiliations—will be given fair and equal opportunities and fair employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this clause service in the RUC is to be regarded as employment. I believe that is consistent, because membership of the RUC and the UDR is a job. We see it advertised in the local Press when recruits are needed, so it is a job, and if those people are to do that job well, and enjoy the full support of the community in which they operate, the community must have the protection of this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) said that the RUC is a new police force. It is certainly a very young police force for the most part, but the fact of which he gave example—that so many senior and distinguished officers of the RUC are of the minority faith—shows that neither the new force nor the old one have been sectarian. A chief constable or an assistant chief constable or a chief superintendent cannot have joined the RUC yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known that there used to be a quota system in the Royal Ulster Constabulary. "Quota" has become a term of abhorrence. The working party did not like quotas, the Committee does not like quotas, and the Government do not like quotas. There was a quota system in the Royal Ulster Constabulary but, for one reason or another, the Roman Catholic quota was never fully taken up. No official account is taken of religious denomination in the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the views of the police authority, the chief constable and the Police Federation on the application of the measure to the Royal Ulster Constabulary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the word "hypocrite" would be ruled out of order, but I know that the word "humbug" has already been used in Committee. Sometimes that could be applied to some of the comments we hear from the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst I do not agree with what my hon. Friend said about excluding the RUC and the UDR from the Bill, I agree that there have been genuine and sincere attempts to allay the suspicions of the sectarian label which was applied to the RUC and the UDR over the years. The quota system in the RUC and the request for religious affiliation were ended in an attempt to remove sectarianism completely from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>490</span>
RUC and the UDR. The problem was not that Catholics were refused entry to either organisation, but that they did not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Valiant efforts have been made over the years to attract people from the Catholic community into both the RUC and the UDR. But it has been of no avail. There were no applicants. I am worried that when we do a survey of the RUC—and we are likely to survey some of the companies listed by the hon. Member for Belfast, West—we shall come to the conclusion, on the basis that it is 92 per cent. or 93 per cent. Protestant, that discrimination has occurred. Some people are bound to come to that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again we shall be in the difficult situation of interpreting this Bill in a certain way, applying it to one sector of employment in Northern Ireland and interpreting it in a completely different way when applying it to another employment sector. I should welcome an unlimited influx of the hon. Member's faith into the UDR and the RUC. Tragically, another member of the UDR was murdered in my constituency a few hours ago. It would do a lot to remove any labels attached to either of the two forces if the hon. Member and his party would encourage his supporters to join them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a slight risk that the Committee may be misdirecting itself on this question. We are not discussing—I am sure we ought not to be—whether religious discrimination is or should be exercised in the recruitment of the police forces in Northern Ireland. We are discussing whether the machinery of the Bill is appropriate for dealing with the suspicion or accusation that such discrimination exists.

My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) has drawn attention to a very real and essentially constitutional difficulty in the framing of the Bill. In other circumstances I am sure that the line taken would be that Ministers were responsible to Parliament for the manner in which the public services are recruited and conducted and that therefore there was no need—indeed, there was a certain inadvisability—to make the general law which governed the behaviour of private employers, especially in so delicate a matter as this, apply to services for which at any time the responsible Minister could be called to question in this House.

11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From another point of view my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) was on the same point. We all know perfectly well that there are circumstances in the service of the Crown which the Minister should be prepared to defend and explain, and would defend and explain, where the general concepts of the Bill would not apply, and where the action and the idea of the agency going through all the procedures laid down in the Bill in regard to the Royal Ulster Constabulary is rather absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We got into this difficulty for reasons for which we got into many other difficulties—that is, we are still in a state of constitutional flux in Northern Ireland. We are in a state of transition from a past—to which, whether we like it or not, we shall not return—to some future form of administration. Whether or not it resembles the present one is not yet clear. All through the interim—though all life is an interim—we are trying to legislate for a future which we cannot foresee. I believe that that is the reason why we have got ourselves in the somewhat absurd situation of applying to services for which Ministers, certainly at present, are responsible to the House of Commons the mechanism of a Bill which is designed to deal with private citizens in their activities and their relations with one another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) put before the Committee a very profound difficulty in which we find ourselves in dealing with the Bill. With respect to my hon. Friend, I do not feel that at this stage in 1976 it would be practicable or sound for us to vote against the clause, as we might in other circumstances, on the ground that there will be ministerial responsibility anyhow, and that the House of Commons will see that the standards it wants are applied by Ministers of the Crown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I happen not merely to hope but to believe that, whatever be the future constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland, there will be proper ministerial responsibility properly discharged for the recruitment, conduct, behaviour and so on of all the servants of the Crown in Northern Ireland as well as in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In parting with the clause, it is right that the Committee should recognise that we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>492</span>
are doing something which is constitutionally anomalous, that we are doing it in circumstances that are anomalous, but that we ought to take account of what we are doing. One is gradually, step by step, moving from the principles of parliamentary democracy as we know them to a different system of democracy in which it is ultimately the courts of law and not the House of Commons which are the arbiter of the behaviour of those in authority. Therefore, there is, without taking time upon it, a big philosophical question lying behind the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has been able to see for itself the confusion which exists among UUUC Members. The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) seeks to have the clause deleted. He is against the inclusion of the RUC. His hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) seeks to have the clause retained, and the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) backs both his colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are all right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member backs both horses in this race. Therefore, he will not find himself in any difficulty whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, however, important to bring to the Committee's attention the fact that the existence of the clause will give protection to the ordinary RUC constable—one who is already a member of the RUC. It is not to be a recruiting agency for people joining the RUC. The ambit of the clause will cover those who are at present members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. If, for example, a Catholic or Protestant member of that force feels that he has been subjected to discrimination by his superiors, that he has been transferred to one part of the country, perhaps because there is dislike by his superior of the individual involved, he will have the protection of this law. He will learn to be able to have recourse to the Fair Employment Agency, and inquiries will be made to see whether the attitude of a senior police officer towards a particular police constable is justified. So I think on those grounds alone it is giving protection to ordinary members of the RUC irrespective of their political or religious affiliations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) about the unfortunate death of Brian O'Malley. We have not just lost a Minister; many of us have lost a very close friend, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) who, unfortunately, is not in his place at the moment, Clause 53 (6) covers the point of the police force and is defined by reference to the Police Act, 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison), consultations did take place with the appropriate organisations about the inclusion of the police force, and the organisations were content that they be included within the terms of the Bill as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to the minor argument that we have just witnessed, it is evident from what has been said that it would be entirely wrong to exclude the RUC from the terms of the Bill. The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster one day wants to extend the Bill; another day he wants to reduce its scope. I understand his arguments. However everybody in this Committee knows that following Hunt, Sir Arthur Young and the establishment of Sir Jamie Flanagan—who, I think, everybody agrees has been an outstanding chief constable in Northern Ireland, and I am sure we wish his successor also every success in a difficult job—the RUC should be included if only to remove some of the fears and suspicions that people in Northern Ireland have about the police force itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say to the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) that there is no danger in getting back to quotas. The Government want to see the expansion of the RUC, and we want to see the full participation of the minority and the majority in what I would term as their police force. We see no alternative. What the Government have attempted to do is to upgrade policing, and we want to see policing replacing many of the jobs in the role that the army is playing at present in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point that the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) made about the public sector, and that this removes from Parliament certain responsibilities and powers that it had previously. We have deliberately included
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>494</span>
the public sector, because in the public sector over the years there has been so much criticism about discrimination in Northern Ireland. What encourages me is the manner in which the people of both denominations are working happily together, and not on a quota basis. It was revealed by sheer accident the other day that, where one would have thought a small Department was predominantly of one religion by the sheer necessity of the people who were employed in it, it was, in fact, the other way round. The officers at that time could not tell me the respective religions of the people concerned. It came to light only because of a specific incident which involved the security forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of this problem I believe that it is right that justice has not only to be done, but that it has to be seen to be done. Certainly in Northern Ireland it has to be seen to be done. That is the Government's intention as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) says that there are conflicting arguments and accuses the hon. Member for Down, South of riding two horses. It is a poor politician who cannot ride two horses. Some have to ride more at times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful debate and one on a reasonable level. Everyone has shown the need for the RUC, the need for its expansion and the need to remove any fear that there is discrimination. I am sure that there is not. The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) made the point that the quota system had been used and found wanting. We are not looking for another quota system. We want people to come in freely because they think that it is the right thing to do for Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 159, in page 37, line 21, leave out subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. To the layman it is not clear why, having laid down with great care in subsection (1) how a notice or document may be served, in subsection (2) we say that any other lawful method of service will do just as well. There must be some reason behind this—some "purpose in liquidity", as the poet has it—but at least one diligent student of the Bill found that it eluded him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add a word on this amendment and the general meaning of the clause. It seems to me that if the other seven or eight avenues for serving a notice or document upon a recipient have been utilised, it is most unfair to suggest that
	<br><q><p>"any other lawful method of service"—</p></q>
presumably a method additional to those set out—should be employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at the different methods we are enacting by passing subsection (1) it seems quite unnecessary to have subsection (2) at all. For instance, subsection (1) says:
	<br><q><p>"Any notice or other document which is required or permitted by this Act to be served on a person may—</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>496</span>
	<br><q><p>(	<i>a</i>) if that person is an individual, be served on him—
	<ol>
	<li>by delivering it to him, or</li>
	<li>by sending it to him by post".</li>
</ol></p></q>
Thirdly, if the person is not there, the notice may lawfully be delivered upon him
	<br><q><p>"by leaving it for him at"</p></q>
his last-known place of residence or business. Additionally,
	<br><q><p>"if that person is a body corporate or un-incorporate,"</p></q>
the notice may be properly served
	<br><q><p>"(i) by sending it by post to the proper officer of the body at its registered or principal office, or at its principal office in Northern Ireland,"—</p></q>
—presumably for onward transmission to the recipient—
	<br><q><p>"or,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(ii) by addressing it to the proper officer of the body and leaving it at any such office."</p></q>
So there we have seven ways in which such a document can properly and legally be delivered and served.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister, when he answers the hon. Gentleman, to outline to the Committee what other lawful methods of service he has in mind. I take it that he does not include pigeon post or anything like that. Is a lawful method of service sending a telegram? Does a lawful method of service include telephoning and, if the man is out, leaving a message? Going a further step down the scale, would a lawful method of service be by word of mouth? Would passing a message to a friend, former employer, or associate of the person in question and leaving a verbal message be a lawful method? Before the Committee permits what I regard as a very elastic subsection which has no business in the Bill at all, the very least we want is a detailed and concise explanation from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point about the telegram is covered by the word "document" in the first line of the subsection. The hon. Gentleman's amendment is a genuine probing amendment which has produced one clear example of another lawful method of service under Section 361 of the Companies Act (Northern Ireland) 1960, that relates to a company incorporated outside Northern Ireland and carrying on business in Northern Ireland. Such a company is obliged to leave with the registrar of companies the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>497</span>
name and address of at least one person resident in Northern Ireland who can accept service on behalf of the company. Service can then be effected if the process or notice to be served is addressed to that person and is left at or posted to that address. This could obviously differ from the person and address specified in subsection (1). I hope that that answers the right hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one can say that the Minister of State has not been generous and forthcoming in supplying chapter and verse for subsection (2), but he will not be surprised at the effect that produces on at least one Member of the Committee. It is the request that, since, with the assistance of the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr), we have had to spend more time than was necessary in elucidating the actual meaning of subsection (2), trouble and time should be saved to others by including in the clause the specific reference to service in accordance with the section of the Act that he quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<div class='title'>GENERAL INTERPRETATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 161, in page 39, line 20, leave out "has employment available" and insert "is offering employment".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 168, in page 42, line 7, leave out subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause deals with general interpretation. The amendments deal specifically with the interpretation of employer, potential employee or potential applicant. We are concerned that, in relation to a person seeking employment, an employer is anybody who has employment available. What does that mean and how will it be interpreted? How will anyone know when an employer has employment available? It is obvious to Members of the Committee that circumstances can change so rapidly that one day there may not be a vacancy and the next day there may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that the Bill is trying to cover the situation where an employer, who may have employment available, has not offered it publicly by advertising either within the company or in the Press or by notifying the employment exchange. This interpretation will cover the possibility of an employer slipping out from under the net by not making it known that he has employment available. I can understand that situation. But, in its present form, the clause could be interpreted as meaning any employer in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An employer is always potentially in a position to offer employment. As circumstances can change so rapidly, we would prefer the wording to be amended so that to a person seeking employment, an employer will be anybody who is offering employment. The words "offering employment" would cover him offering employment publicly, by notification to the labour exchange, or by advertising inside the company. We are concerned that the definition of employer should be more specific.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of the potential employee or applicant, the Bill states:
	<br><q><p>"For the purposes of this Act a person is seeking employment if he is available for employment, whether or not he is aware of the existence of an opportunity for any particular employment."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>499</span>
I am potentially available for employment as I stand here. We are all potentially seeking employment. (	<i>Interruption.</i>) It may be that some people are more available for employment than others. We believe that this interpretation will cover every person in Northern Ireland, because any person is potentially available for employment, depending on the factors which surround a particular job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the Minister intend by these definitions? We should like to be satisfied that they are not as wide and as general as we suspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us are more available for employment at the moment than others. Amendment No. 161 would weaken the Bill because it would allow the employer to evade the Bill's provisions by not advertising which is covered in Part II. The employer would merely say nothing about any vacancies in his organisation and fill them only from persons who met his religious and political criteria and who came to him and said "Have you a job for me?" He would clearly be able to exercise a great measure of control over such casual enquiries by refusing to contemplate employing persons against whom he wished to discriminate on the grounds "I am not offering employment". Such a possibility of evasion could not be accepted. The intention is to make all vacancies for employment—except those few specifically exempted by the Bill—freely available to all applicants irrespective of religious or political beliefs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) that if an employer takes on an employee, he clearly had employment available beforehand. Employers are not always offering employment. Unfortunately, due to the economic recession, we see people losing employment. Of course, that is not what we want to see. Therefore, an employer does not always offer employment. The hon. Member for Armagh takes too wide a view of what "employment available" means. The same goes for the phrase "available for employment". I maintain that these definitions are essential to the Bill as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is any disposition on the part of my hon. Friends and myself to create any loophole through which the kind of malpractice
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>500</span>
described by the right hon. Gentleman could pass. However, we are genuinely anxious and are not yet satisfied that the concept of availability is necessary for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman at one point almost appeared to say that it would be expected that those who had employment available would advertise it. There is no such requirement, nor could there be, in the Bill. But later in his remarks I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman answered his own problem when he said that plainly, if somebody was taken on, the employment was available the moment before he was taken on. If that is so—I readily concede that it is—all the Bill's provisions will bite. The possibility of bringing home a charge of discrimination, if it is justifiable, will exist the moment that somebody is given employment, or even earlier—namely, at the moment that an offer is made and accepted. At that moment the applicability of the Bill runs. It seems to me that, if we leave the definition as it is, we shall be placing upon the agency an almost impossible onus to discharge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the first amendment, which refers to anyone who has "employment available". Let us suppose that, as a matter of managerial judgment, the manager of a firm employing 30 persons decides not to fill one or two posts when they fall vacant. That is a managerial decision, 	<i>in petto,</i> in his own breast. It is not justiciable; it is not ascertainable objectively. As manager, he has said "I think that we can get by. We shall see how it goes. I shall not fill these two posts". In those circumstances, it would be difficult to prove that he had not two jobs available. The question why those two jobs were not filled would then arise. It is unreasonable to place upon the agency the burden of considering whether discrimination arises throughout the range of employment to which the Bill applies. For example, where a job was not filled after a retirement or resignation, the agency would have to consider why at that time it was not filled and whether discrimination arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conversely, subsection (4) refers to a person being available for employment. That is an extraordinarily wide concept. Without any jocularity, one is literally available—if availability includes being
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>501</span>
unaware of the existence of the opportunity—for an immense range of jobs at any given time. I should imagine that I am available for a number of posts—none of which I have any intention of applying for or taking up—instructing youth in Greek. I am unaware of these posts and am not interested in them, but I am probably available for them since they do not fall within the disqualification provisions for a Member of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not querying the object, but, as this is the definition clause, we are asking for a more careful scrutiny of the ambit of this notion of availability. The right hon. Gentleman has made it increasingly clear, as we have progressed, that the agency should conduct its operations in an entirely practical and reasonable manner. Therefore we must not, by statute, open to the agency areas of investigation and inquiry which would be unduly or absurdly onerous. Will the right hon. Gentleman consider whether the loophole which he designated and which we do not want—if it still exists—can be blocked without this wide scope which the concept of availability appears to open?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to the right hon. Gentleman. I concede that we are in another difficult area of definition. For example, if an employer decides not to fill a vacancy, the employment is not available. In these circumstances, the agency will act sensibly. Much will depend upon the intelligent operation and actions of the agency itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred to advertising. The agency could direct an employer to advertise in order to provide equality of opportunity. However, he is not automatically compelled by the Bill to do so and in many instances it might not be necessary. Dealing with discrimination by employers, Clause 17(	<i>a</i>)(	<i>i</i>) refers to arrangements employers make to see who should be offered a job. That could include advertisement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the amendments would damage the Bill. It will need sensible interpretation. On that basis, I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
This definition is one of enactment. It is not clear to my hon. Friends and myself why, since an enactment could be made—I think that I am right in using the past tense—under the 1972 Act by Order in Council, the 1974 Act, under which by Order in Council enactments are now being made, is not included in the ambit of the definition. I dare say that there is some very tricky reason and no problem at all, and that in a few seconds that will be revealed to the Committee. But to our limited perception it is not so far visible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that one of the many drafting amendments made by the right hon. Gentleman this time is on a very technical point. I think I have a satisfactory answer for him if he, and the Committee, will bear with me. The word "enactment" when used in the Bill is defined by Clause 57(1) as including any Act of the former Stormont Parliament, any measure of the Northern Ireland Assembly and any Order in Council made under the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972—the Act which regulated the first period of direct rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's amendment would add a reference to any Order in Council made under the Northern Ireland Act 1974 which regulates the present period of direct rule. The answer, therefore, is that it is unnecessary, because the Northern Ireland Act 1974, in Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 to 7, provides that in any enactment passed before or after the 1974 Act references to measures include references to Orders in Council made under the 1974 Act. So the reference to measures in Clause 57(2) will cover these Orders in Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the elucidation of the Committee, I would add further that it is necessary to refer expressly to Orders in Council made under the 1972 Direct Rule Act. The answer is that the Act did not clearly provide that references to the Northern Ireland Acts in subsequent instruments include references to Orders in Council made under the 1972 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

It is reassuring to know that as we are to enjoy the benefits of the 1974 Act, Schedule 1, at any rate for some little time to come, by dint of the power therein contained of renewal, we shall not have to include a reference to that Act whenever an enactment is mentioned in any other United Kingdom Act of Parliament. I think we can mildly offer our congratulations to the administration upon this achievement, and in that spirit I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 163, in page 40, line 21, leave out from "organisation" to end of line 22.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 164, in page 40, line 23, leave out "of" and insert "for".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This, as is almost inevitable in a definition clause, is a matter of drafting. It is also a probing amendment. The words in line 20 and following lines on page 40 are:
	<br><q><p>"a class of person recognised by the organisation as having any particular status in connection with an employment or occupation."</p></q>
My hon. Friends and I do not understand what is added, or what restriction is introduced, by the words which we seek to leave out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the definition is a definition of "member". What we mean is a person recognised by an organisation in connection with an employment. If the employment is chartered surveying it is an organisation concerned with chartered surveying. If it is bricklaying it is an organisation concerned with bricklaying. It is not necessary that that organisation should be recognised as having any particular status in connection with it. I cannot understand why, for the purposes of being a member, a person has to be recognised as Class 1, Class 2 or Class 3, as it were, or as one kind of surveyor rather than another. Surely we want the broadest possible definition of the relationship between organisations and those in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
employment to which those organisations relate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the right hon. Gentleman, threading through these difficult mazes I am attempting, with the utmost precision of which I am capable, to present my difficulties. I am sure he will respond in the same manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Basically, it is a definition of what a member is. That is the vital point. Without the words which the amendment seeks to delete, this part of the definition of "member" would be widened to include persons belonging to a class of persons whether or not they had any particular status in connection with an employment or occupation for the purposes of which the organisation exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this part of the definition is to ensure that persons who do not have full membership of an organisation but, for example, a student or associate status, are prevented from being discriminated against in the same way as full "members". The amendment would involve a risk, that the class of persons included in the definition would be widened so as to include persons who had no connection with the employments or occupations with which the organisation is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that clarifies the probing amendment and puts on record exactly what we mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman. It is clear, following his explanation, that since the Bill deals with employment or occupation, it must be only that aspect of recognition by an organisation which attracts the meaning of "member" for the purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 175, in page 40, line 39, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"'private household' means the domicile of a person and the outbuildings thereof and those members of the family whose home it is together with those gainfully employed therein".</p></q>
It was at the invitation of the Minister that I put down this amendment because I felt it wrong that Clause 57 should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>505</span>
allowed to proceed without at least an attempt to define the words "private household". If we cannot define them and cannot come to an agreement upon them, it would be of great value to hear the Minister's reaction to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basically, I have sought to define the meaning of the words "private household" for the purposes of the Bill. To support the definition which I hesitantly put together in Amendment No. 175 I should like to call the Committee's attention to a document I have here, namely, Strouds Judicial Dictionary. In that book, which is available in the Library, there is a definition of the words "private dwelling house". There is no definition of the word "household" and for that I shall turn to another book of reference in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Strouds Judicial Dictionary, page 2113, a private dwelling house is a building which is not used as a school, or for educational purposes. It is a building lived in by a family. It is not used for taking in paying guests or as a lodging-house. In no circumstances is it used as an office or a dancing academy, although it is, or could be—according to Strouds—a dwelling-house in which the lessee or owner has a friend or friends to live with him, not for profit but to lighten the housekeeping expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 2114 there are one or two examples of previous enactments in the House which it will probably help the Committee to know a little about before coming to a decision on this amendment. For instance, one of the Water Acts had the difficult job of deciding what was a private dwelling-house. Strouds states that a private dwelling-house is
	<br><q><p>"according to the ordinary use of language, the house in which a man lives as his HOME, as distinguished from a house which he uses only for business purposes".</p></q>
To be a little more up-to-date, Schedule 2 of the Housing Act 1957, which attempted to define what was a private dwelling, states that a private dwelling
	<br><q><p>"means either a dwelling occupied by a person 'in his private capacity' or a dwelling occupied 'as the dwelling-house of a private person'; therefore, it does not include occupation by a company."</p></q>
I have given the Committee one or two definitions of private dwelling-house in Strouds Judicial Dictionary, and we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
would do well to look at another publication which is available in the Library entitled "Words and Phrases Legally Defined". Here we get nearer to the substance of the amendment which I put down insomuch as an attempt is made, on page 379, to define the word "household". I shall not read all the definition given in this lengthy extract, but it is important that one or two short extracts are read because it is pertinent to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under "Household" it states:
	<br><q><p>"A man may be related to a household in two ways. He may be a member of the household, or he may be the head of the household…"</p></q>
It then gives examples which have taken place in law courts up and down the country, when claims were made against insurance companies. Sometimes the claims were not readily resolved, resulting in the claims being settled in court. One or two interesting extracts define the meaning of "household" as a result of those legal decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, it states that underwriters,
	<br><q><p>"while insuring the assured against his liability to passengers, except in their own favour his liability to a passenger who is a 'member of the assured's household'. The question is, accordingly, whether, on the true construction of the policy, the exception covers not only the narrower class of members of a household of which the plaintiff is a member. Branson, J., takes the view that the more natural meaning of the phrase covers the wider class, namely, members of the household of which the plaintiff is a member…"</p></q>
It goes on to give the example that
	<br><q><p>"Branson, J. takes the view that the more natural meaning of the phrase covers the wider class, namely, members of the household of which the plaintiff is a member…"</p></q>
and in this case—an extract from page 379—the definition was given that this wider view was taken. In other words, the head of the household and his family and any people taken to be staying with him at the time would be regarded as the household for the purposes of this particular definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It continues with extracts, with which I shall not weary the Committee, beyond giving a very brief reference to them, about attempts that have been made in other countries to define the word "household" in interpretation clauses in their legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am driven to the conclusion, from my research in the Library, in this place that no attempt has ever succeeded in this House to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
define the words "private household". It is certainly not included in any Act of Parliament in this country to which our Library was able to refer me, and I have every confidence in the ability of our Library staff. It is helpful, therefore, to look at two examples in Australia and Canada, where an attempt was made to define the meaning of the word "household".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Australia, in the Matrimonial Causes Act 1959,
	<br><q><p>"a child of either the husband or the wife if, at the relevant time, the child was ordinarily a 'member of the household' of the husband and wife, shall be deemed to be a child of the marriage. Whether a child was ordinarily a member of the household is a question of fact, and whether the child was ordinarily a member of the household immediately before the parties ceased to live together is also a question of fact…"</p></q>
In Canada, the word "household" was defined in the broad sense of the family. They decided that the household
	<br><q><p>"…is a collective group living in a house, acknowledging the authority of a head, the members of which, with few exceptions, are bound by marriage, blood affinity or other bond, between whom there is an intimacy…"</p></q>
and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Canada, therefore, which is probably the most interesting definition we have, there are not only members of the family resident in a dwelling house admitted as members of a private household, but also, in the words of this Canadian definition, "with few exceptions". In other words, there are exceptions to the actual family link between those resident in a house, and presumably, for their purposes of definition the word "household" in Canada would include friends and others staying in the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned those two references because I thought they would be of some help to the Committee in coming to a decision on my Amendment No. 175. The definition I have put here has not been included in any Act of Parliament to which the Library can refer me. It seems to me, however, to be a meaning with which the Committee would generally agree. In other words, the household consists not only of the closely-knit family and perhaps guests or servants staying there, but also workers who perhaps work in a garden adjacent to the house in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Committee is aware of what has just happened. At this,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
which might even be the final stage of our consideration of this Bill, we have witnessed the first major contribution to our deliberations made by the official Opposition. Perhaps it is just as well that the quality and content of that contribution should be noted, and should have become clear before we parted with this stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the hon. Gentleman fortunately included in the most succinct form the best reason against his amendment—namely, that no Act of Parliament had previously endeavoured to define "private household", and long before he reached the end of his remarks we were convinced of the wisdom of our ancestors, more especially in a context such as this, where "private household" is concerned with purposes of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, speaking personally, I must pay this tribute to the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr). I had until this moment been unaware of the existence of a work—Stroud's Judicial Dictionary—from which, quite evidently—judging by the high numbers of page references and extracts, some of them very fine—infinite entertainment is to be derived. I think that in future, those who are compiling lists of books to be taken on desert islands would be unwise to omit Stroud's Judicial Dictionary from their lists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I can say is that I hope the right hon. Gentleman sticks around, because if he happens to be in his place when I move my next amendment, I have a further variety of recommended reading which I shall give to him, and I can pass all the documents to him with my own compliments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one has yet been present while this Committee was sitting when I was absent, but that perhaps does not apply to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was doing what seemed to be the minimum by way of recognising the significance of the event that has occurred. I assume that the right hon. Gentleman will advise against the novel attempt to define "private household", and in that he will have the support of my hon. Friends and myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following what the right hon. Gentleman for Down, South (Mr. Powell) said, the learned researches of the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) in this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
matter take us no further along the road. In fact, in the terms of the Bill, the words "private household" do not show that the agency cannot safely apply the concept without the aid of this amendment; and, as has been pointed out, the difficulties of defining these factors are great indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather like an elephant—sometimes difficult to describe, but we all know what we are talking about. And as regards private households, I am sure that the agency will have the common sense to define what is a private household in a proper context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Member for what he is saying. I do not wish to interrupt him before he has said something more interesting, but why should we apply common sense so far as a private household is concerned and not be permitted to apply that same common sense so far as a school is concerned? A school is defined; a private household is not. What is the actual difference between the two elements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to be fair about this, but the examples the hon. Gentleman gave where dwelling houses are used, are outside the terms of this Bill. Many of the examples he gave are not relevant. They are in a different context from this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said that in general terms "private household" is taken to mean a family unit. Any attempt to define "private household" is considered unnecessary, since the agency, the courts and reasonable people generally will have no doubts about the meaning of the words. The hon. Gentleman has rightly explored with the Committee how this could be defined, as my hon. Friend invited him to do. I hope that he will appreciate that it is not possible to define it in the terms he mentions. For those reasons the Government must reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 174, in page 41, line 4, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"'Religious denomination' means a religion recognised by the World Council of Churches".</p></q>
I should like to attempt to define the words "religious denomination". These words appear in an earlier part of the Bill and again are without any form of definition in Clause 57. I have tabled this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>510</span>
definition clause at the suggestion of the hon. Gentleman opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I have done is of extreme simplicity and does not attempt to define the two words separately or to link the meaning of the two words either taken together or taken separately. It is simply to define the meanings of the words "religious denomination" as a religion recognised by the World Council of Churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to explain the thought behind the amendment, I should tell the Committee something about the World Council of Churches. I can recommend to the hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) the Oxford Dictionary on Christian Churches, with which he may or may not be familiar. There is some delightful reading in it which I recommend him to take with him over Easter. Under "World Council of Churches" he will find a lengthy extract dealing with the qualifications of this body to perform the role which Amendment No. 174 suggests they should perform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The World Council of Churches is a fellowship of churches constituted in Amsterdam on 23rd August 1948. The idea of establishing the World Council of Churches was first mooted before the war intervened. As a result, the former constitution was delayed until 1948. The purpose of the Council, as defined in the constitution, is that it is a fellowship of churches which recognises certain objectives of the Christian religion. The Council is served by a presidium, which is a representative assembly meeting at six- or seven-yearly intervals. Since the World Council of Churches was first established, recent assemblies have been held in Amsterdam, the United States, India, and other countries. The latest assembly was held in Nairobi a few months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason for including this as the definition of the meaning of "religious denomination" was that the World Council of Churches has such a huge number of member churches. To be a member of the World Council of Churches certain procedures must be followed. At its formation in 1948 the Council had 144 member churches, but by 1970 the number had risen to 230. With the exception of the Roman Catholic Church and the Unitarians, the Council includes all the main denominations of the Western World and nearly all the Eastern Orthodox Churches, including the Patriarchate of Moscow
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
and 120 other churches in the non-Western world, mainly in Asia and Africa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Roman Catholic Church is not a member, since 1961 the Vatican has appointed accredited observers to the seven-yearly assemblies which the World Council of Churches holds. In addition, to show that this particular World Council of Churches is linked with all the churches—and I have put it in this way—which matter, a formal joint secretariat has been formed linking the World Council of Churches in certain areas. I would imagine that the application of this Bill was one area where possible social injustices need examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman tell us whether the World Council of Churches has published a list of churches which it recommends and whether, in the light of what the hon. Gentleman has said, the Roman Catholic church would be recognised in the terms of the amendment? As someone who prides himself on his knowledge of Northern Ireland, is not the hon. Gentleman aware of the difficulty there might be of finding churches which recognise the World Council of Churches, as distinct from the World Council recognising the churches?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think those in Northern Ireland will have to recognise many novel ideas if the Bill reaches the statute book. This will probably be one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the points raised by the hon. Gentleman in a moment. For the sake of brevity I shall not list all the member churches of the Council of Churches. As I have said, in 1970 there were 230, and it would take me until one o'clock to read the list. Moreover, since 1970 quite a number of other churches have been added to the ranks. I shall deal with that in more detail shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the Council's work—this is an important aspect in relation to the amendment—is advisory. It has created a number of administrative units of which the largest is a division of inter-church aid, refugees and world service. The body carries out an extensive programme of service to refugees and migrants and the victims of famine and other disasters. Other units in the World Council of Churches with administrative responsibility are the Theological Education Fund, the Christian Medical Commission, the Agency for Christian
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>512</span>
Literature Development, the Education Renewal Fund and the Commission of the Churches on International Affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This particular body had 230 member churches in 1970. In 1975 the number increased to 282—this is partly in answer to the intervention by the hon. Member—and include churches in over 90 countries. The chief denominations represented are Anglican, Baptist, Congregational, Disciples, Lutheran, Methodist, Moravian—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a marginal question of order. I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is trying to argue, but he should mainly be arguing the need for a definition in the Bill of religious denomination and not only giving us a history of the activities of the World Council of Churches. It is a marginal point, but I think that the hon. Gentleman should concentrate more on the need for the definition which he proposes in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what you have said, Mrs. Jeger, but the Bill creates certain exceptions for those who practise in a religious denomination of one sort or another. I think it would be of help to the Committee to have some idea of what the consequence would be if the definition which I have suggested in Amendment No. 174 were accepted. Indeed, I was answering a diversion by the hon. Member for Armagh. Had I not been waylaid, I should have progressed further, which I shall now do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, to show the Committee the sort of role which the World Council of Churches plays, I refer to the last seven-yearly meeting which took place in Nairobi in December of last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having great difficulty in relating what happened in Nairobi to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that you will see instantly that one of the resolutions in the Nairobi Conference, which took place at the end of November last year, was a resolution relating to racial discrimination anywhere. I believe that I am right in saying that the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Bill, with which we are getting on fairly well, deals with religious discrimination and attempts to prevent it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must get this right for the record. The hon. Member referred

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>513</span>
to racial discrimination being on the agenda of the Nairobi Conference. However, that is not the question before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have said racial and religious discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to conclude by saying that in the November and December conference, which was well attended by over 2,500 people in Nairobi, there were resolutions, some of which I personally strongly disagree with, supporting what I regard as terrorist movements in certain countries of the world. However, other resolutions attacking apartheid, racial discrimination and religious discrimination in any part of the world, which resolutions I fully support, were discussed and adopted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I feel that the World Council of Churches is the right body to go through for definition of "religious denomination" in regard to this part of the Bill. It is a body of churches which, as I have shown to the Committee, is of world wide application. It has practising branches in many countries. I feel that if we have this reference included in the Bill it will make it much easier for a Minister of the day, who has the job of implementing it, to decide whether a religious denomination is bogus, 	<i>bona fide</i> or whatever decision the World Council of Churches recommends. I have not been in touch with the World Council of Churches, but I can unhesitatingly say, from what I know of it, that if it felt that it would help in any way it would be glad to advise the Minister in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with great interest to the dissertation of the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr). What comes to mind immediately when one is looking for definition is what happens if the World Council of Churches decides to exclude certain people, disintegrates or only covers Christian religions. What about Far Eastern religions? What about Mormons? What about spiritualists? What about, if I may say so, the Free Presbyterians who would not be covered by the Bill, and the definition in regard to the Roman Catholic Church did not make it clear whether or not that religion would be included?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the amendment tries to cover the problem by talking about "recognised". I assume that the hon. Member for Harborough means that because there are observers it could be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>
recognised. However, it could not be recognised as such. The provisions of the clause define religion in terms that people will clearly understand in Northern Ireland. The concept of religious denomination, I believe, can be safely left to the agency which will have the common sense in Northern Ireland to decide on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in line with that, the hon. Member for Harborough will recognise that his amendment, far from helping the situation, could make it much more difficult. For those reasons, the Government cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Perhaps I should deal with them in that way, the least difficult first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 165 proposes the insertion of the words "or supposed absence" after "absence" in the context of religious belief or political opinion. We touched on this point at an earlier stage in our proceedings and, I may have been mistaken, but I thought I caught something by way of smoke signals which suggested a recognition that if religious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>515</span>
belief is to include supposed religious belief, then the absence of religious belief ought to include the supposed absence of religious belief. That is, a man ought to be protected against being discriminated against as an atheist although he is not really an atheist but is only supposed to be. It seems sauce for the goose and sauce for the gander that the absence and presence should both include supposed absence and presence. At that point, since it may be that I shall receive some gratification in that context, I shall leave that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next matter is the difficulty arising from the subjectivity of religious belief, a difficulty not entirely removed by the use of the word "supposed". In this group of amendments we propose two alternative ways of dealing with the problem of the subjectivity of belief. Clearly it is desirable that the ground of alleged or real discrimination should be a ground which is as apprehensible as possible. We want to avoid being led by legislation into the metaphysic of how one can possibly know what a man really believes and, therefore, how one can create lawful or unlawful behaviour out of the concept of what is believed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Amendment No. 165, on the words "supposed absence", to clear the air and to save further debate I want to say that the Government accept that amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. As so often, the smoke signals did not mislead me and I shall move Amendment No. 165 formally when we come to it. I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, back to the second of the two topics—the difficulty of the subjectivity of belief. We propose two alternative ways of getting out of the difficulty. The first is to substitute "denomination" for "belief" on the ground that denomination is much more objective than belief. There are objective tests which can be brought to bear to see whether a man's denomination is Roman Catholic, whereas only Him to whom all hearts are open knows whether a person really does believe the tenets of the Roman Catholic faith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case the word "denomination" should be a difficult one for use in a statute—and I think that the debate which has just concluded may have reinforced that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>516</span>
suspicion—we propose an alternative which is set out in Amendment No. 173 to include
	<br><q><p>"holding a religious belief … references to professing that belief."</p></q>
In other words, if this, or some amendment to the same effect, is accepted, it will not be necessary—as it would strictly, I think, be necessary in some circumstances—to prove what a man really believes but only to prove that he does profess a certain belief. The difficulties of interpretation and so on would be much less with the objective evidence of professing a belief being included as part of holding it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit to the right hon. Gentleman the second proposition, namely, that belief is too subjective, as it stands in subsection (2), to bear the weight of the whole of this legislation against religious discrimination. We need to bring in or substitute something capable of more ready, objective ascertainment and definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now proceed finally to the third point with which Amendment No. 172 deals. We are here returning to a very important debate which took place earlier in the Committee's work and fulfilling a forecast which was made in our Eighth Sitting on 25th March, that we would be able to return to this matter in connection with this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We return to it greatly assisted by the outcome of the debate which took place on 25th March. My hon. Friends and I, finding political opinion at large in Part III and subsequent parts of the Bill, have felt grave difficulties in the Northern Ireland context where very often political opinion carries implications such that no employer could justifiably be proceeded against for not taking it into account in employing, promoting or whatever it might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Towards the end of that debate the right hon. Gentleman greatly helped the Committee when he said:
	<br><q><p>"We must get this point absolutely clear. What I said was that a person—whether or not he is a member of an organisation to which we have referred—who advocates or takes part in violence toward another person and condones violence as a means of resolving the problem in Northern Ireland will not be protected under the provisions of the Bill."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee H,</i> 25th March 1976; c. 363.]</p></q>
In other words, that political opinion for the purposes of the Bill does not include the opinion that for political purposes, violence ought to be exercised, approved of or promoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>517</span>
What we are doing is to invite the right hon. Gentleman to find a way of crystallising that definition—that meaning—on the face of the Bill. There are two separate reasons why we feel he should do that. If we, studying the Bill at this stage, have had these apprehensions, they are likely to occur to others who will be affected by the legislation and who may not—though, of course, they are much the losers thereby—peruse in detail the 	<i>Official Report</i> of what is said in Committee room 5. So, for the avoidance of misunderstanding, a very natural misunderstanding, particularly in Northern Ireland, it is desirable that the definition should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it is desirable in order that the intention of Parliament shall be carried out. Here we have a definition by the Minister of the ambit of political opinion which I believe was accepted wholeheartedly by all sides of this Committee. It is the intention, as we represent the Committee stage of the House of Commons, that that shall be the meaning of political opinion in this statute. Therefore, it is our business not to leave it to chance, nor to leave it to the courts, nor to leave it to the 	<i>Official Report</i> to ensure that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not presuming to suppose that the words upon which we have hit, that political opinion does not include—I am talking about Amendment No. 172—the advocacy or support or expression of approval of unlawful behaviour, are necessarily the best method of doing so. We have endeavoured to cast into precise language the clear meaning of what the right hon. Gentleman said. I ask him to recognise that so important is this point that it does need to be dealt with yin the wording of the Bill, and to undertake, as I hope he will, that his definition, which we all understand and accept, will be put in statutory form before the Bill finally reaches the Statute Book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn to the last point on Amendment No. 172, to which the right hon. Gentleman has just referred, on which we had a major debate and on which the right hon. Gentleman was good enough to re-quote my words to the Committee. I think I made as clear and unambiguous as possible what we mean by people who commit acts of violence, or what we think about people who commit or advocate violence, and who will have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>518</span>
no protection under the terms of this Bill. To put this into a form of words within the Bill creates a great difficulty, and we believe it is clear that to discriminate against someone who commits acts of violence is not the same as to discriminate against political opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To gloss the Bill unnecessarily is a mistake and can only cause misunderstanding. There will at times be difficulties when we are dealing with people in Northern Ireland. We may come across cases where people have taken part in violence in the past and have now rejected violence for the future. There could be people, of both communities, coming out of prison, released detainees, who quite openly have said, and are saying, that they reject violence in any future political attempt to change the society in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to see those people discriminated against because they may have been involved in the past in any form of violence. What we want to do—and I am sure that everybody in the Committee not least the right hon. Gentleman, will agree—is to encourage people to turn their backs upon violence as a means of pursuing political aims. People who pursue political aims through violence are completely rejected by the Government, and will continue to be rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I have gone as far as is possible to make that clear, and I am sure that the agency will operate on that basis. I am not opposed to having a look at this point that the right hon. Gentleman made, but I can tell him that I have looked at this matter, and, for instance, the words used in this amendment—
	<br><q><p>"expression of approval of unlawful behaviour"</p></q>
could lead to a great deal of difficulty, because unlawful behaviour need not necessarily be violence. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman would take that into account. We could have forms of unlawful behaviour in Northern Ireland which, in a sense, could be peaceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed recently that certain people—some very prominent people—have been advocating in Northern Ireland unlawful behaviour against the British Government's continuation of direct rule. I think, and I sincerely hope, that better counsels will prevail in Northern Ireland, and I certainly pay credit to some Members in this Committee who have publicly made known
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>519</span>
their views about such behaviour or proposed behaviour. If we are not careful, we could get into a situation which went far beyond that in which the men of the gun and the bomb operate within that society at the present time. I therefore hope that the Committee will accept my assurance that I shall look at it again before Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the narrower but important matter raised by the right hon. Gentleman in his argument about belief and denomination. Denomination has a narrower meaning than belief. That is how the Government see the problem. But the concept of "belief" includes denomination. We have therefore covered the point made by the right hon. Gentleman. If a person belongs to a denomination, that presupposes that he holds its belief. It would be difficult to legislate on that issue, but I am sure that everybody understands clearly what we mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider the right hon. Gentleman's final comment in respect of Amendment No. 173 and the word "profess", we suggest that the words "supposed…belief" cover it. I hope that my explanation meets the right hon. Gentleman's question, and that other hon. Members, too, find it satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the Minister is as sensitive as people in Northern Ireland are to this particular difficulty. I and, I believe, most of the people in Northern Ireland welcome his straightforward assertion on how the phrase "political opinion" should be interpreted 	<i>vis-à-vis</i> violence. I understand the problem that he has put, that in the future—we hope the not too distant future—we shall be trying to rehabilitate 2,000 or 3,000 people. Plainly, employment must be provided for those people. Somehow we must wean them from violence and from the illegal organisations into normal life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister understands this, but there is a tremendous fear among employers in Northern Ireland. We need only look at the violence of yesterday involving three or four hotels and seven business premises, with my own constituency suffering again, to realise that the very people who perpetrated those offences may, for malicious
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
reasons, make an application, be turned down and then allege discrimination. I know that the Minister did not mean it in what he said, but inherent in his remarks was the suggestion that someone might have bombed a business out of existence or murdered the relatives of the proprietor of a business, and in the foreseeable future expect to gain employment because he had perhaps paid the price imposed on him by society, namely, a prison sentence. That prison sentence, however, would not eliminate from the mind of the potential employer the background and history of the events. By our amendment we were trying to ensure that that issue would be covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for having said that he will yet again consider the question of the definition of "political opinion" in the sense that we all intend. I accept his criticism of the terminology "unlawful behaviour" in our amendment. It certainly makes the expression too wide. But I am not yet sure whether the right hon. Gentleman has grasped the kind of situation which causes us anxiety. I I shall try once again to instance it before we leave the matter to his further consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provisional Sinn Fein is not an unlawful organisation. It is not unlawful to belong to Provisional Sinn Fein. But quite a number of those who are members of Provisional Sinn Fein in one sense or another condone, advocate or support, and express support for, the violent pursuit of political ends. Our difficulty is that, if the Bill stays as drafted, it will always be possible to claim that a man was discriminated against because he had political opinion, namely, that he was a member of Provisional Sinn Fein. That is a political opinion. Our difficulty is not that he had himself been guilty of acts of violence but that he was a man who notoriously approved of and encouraged the pursuit of political ends by violent means, and his membership of Provisional Sinn Fein was the badge of that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious to achieve some means of getting behind political opinion to the realities of a situation as they will confront an employer. On 25th March, the right hon. Gentleman's remarks showed that he clearly felt this, too. We therefore
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>521</span>
ask the Minister to concentrate in his endeavours between now and Report to find statutory means, if possible, of implementing his and our wishes in a case such as I described. It is not a question of political violence 	<i>per se.</i> It is not a question of belonging to a political party 	<i>per se.</i> It is the fact that we all know that in Northern Ireland these two are, or may be, linked in a manner which can be dealt with only with particular regard to the circumstances. The wording of the statute ought to enable those particular circumstances to be taken into account. So much for Amendment No. 172.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was taken by surprise when the Minister said that "supposed" included the idea of "profession". It seems to me to be a quite different point. I thought that the purpose of the word "supposed" in subsection (2) was that, if a man was discriminated against in the mistaken impression that he was a Papist but that it turned out after all that he was not, he was still being discriminated against on religious grounds. But the purpose of Amendment No. 173 is different. It is to avoid resting the Bill on the subjectivity of an unsearchable thing, namely, a man's religious belief, and to enable the Agency, the appeals board, the court and all who will be concerned with the working of the Bill to have recourse to something which is ascertainable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not inquiring into whether the man accepts the 39 Articles, if the Church of Ireland has 39 Articles, or accepts a particular article of a particular religion. We are inquiring into his notorious, demonstrable, open profession of belonging to that religion. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman, who has been ready to think again and again in the course of the Committee, will seriously consult his advisers between now and Report to see whether the word "supposed" does what he clearly thought it did, but which I find difficult to imagine can be its effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be dishonest not to contribute to the discussion on the amendments. For the first time in the Committee, I find myself in almost total agreement with the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) when he voices reservations about what power the Ministry will have to prevent people who have advocated violence seeking the protection of the Bill. My only point of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
disagreement with him would be that he and his hon. Friends continue to refer to membership of the Provisional Sinn Fein. There are other lawful organisations in Northern Ireland—the UDA in particular—and many of its spokesmen have in the past made speeches which can only be interpreted as being direct incitement to violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only reason why I selected Provisional Sinn Fein rather than the UDA, for example, is that whereas it is clear, as has been admitted in previous debates, that Provisional Sinn Fein is a political party and political opinions are involved, it might be argued that the UDA was not a political party in the terminology of the Bill. That was the only reason. Otherwise, I am entirely at one with the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the only reason, there are certainly no disagreements. But I can see serious difficulties for the agency in trying to determine whether a person still advocates the violence which he had advocated last year, or the year before. For example, I believe that every utterance of Maire Drumm has beeen calculated to incite violence. I have disagreed with every sentence she has ever uttered in relation to Northern Ireland and its problems. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland obviously feels the same, because he went out of his way last week to condemn that person in the aftermath of the killing of the young British Soldiers in Armagh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does that mean that from now, and for the rest of her life, Maire Drumm will be prevented from seeking the protection of this Bill? Does it mean that someone who has been interned is identified as having in some way been associated with violence? There were many people interned who were not associated with violence. Does it mean that any employer, this year, next year or the year after, will be able to say "You once advocated violence. There is proof of it. There is a report of a speech that you made. There is a report of something you said in court while you were being tried, and I am not going to employ you now or at any time"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to help my hon. Friend. In a sense, he is not at one with the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell). The right hon. Gentleman was trying to define and tie it down in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>523</span>
form of language which the Government believe could make more difficult the point my hon. Friend' is raising. He talks about Mrs. Drumm, for instance. Anybody who actively encourages violence but who does not himself or herself participate in it would not be covered by this Bill. I understand my hon. Friend's point. I tried to make clear to the Committee that what I was trying to do was to distinguish between those who have rejected violence and want to, live peaceably and those who continue to advocate or take part in violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not an easy question and, as we see it, the terminology of the Bill meets my hon. Friend's point, and it will be for the agency—not some other organisation—to decide ultimately on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that my right hon. Friend recognises this problem for what it is, and very serious it is. Who would be in a position to determine whether an individual either has forsaken the advocacy of violence or has been associated with violence?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem we have to face in Northern Ireland is that, if a person is exempted from the provisions of this Bill because he advocated violence or was actively involved in violence, he may never be able to get a job again in Northern Ireland because Catholic employers may not want to employ him. Protestant employers may not want to employ him. Some people may be of the mistaken opinion that, if someone has advocated violence from the Republican side, he will get a job with Catholic employers, and if someone has advocated violence from the Protestant majority side he would be employed in the future by a Protestant employer. That is not necessarily correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person is not to be protected by the Bill, he will undoubtedly in these circumstances become a charge on the State. He can repeatedly go to the agency and say "I have tried to get a job. I made a speech in 1969 or 1970 in which I advocated violence. My possible employers say they are not sure that I have changed my mind, so I must have recourse to supplementary benefit". How long will it be until that person can be considered to have given up his support or advocacy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that we have gone over this in great detail. In the end, the agency will have to decide on this point. It is very unfortunate that people who have taken part in violence may have to prove, perhaps more conclusively, that they are no longer taking part. That is the price they must pay for having played some part in violence. But I assure my hon. Friend that the agency will be aware of these problems, and it will not discriminate unless it is absolutely sure; nor will an employer be allowed to discriminate. But it would be wrong for us to give cover to people who are advocating or taking part in violence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:I accept that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks to Amendment No. 172. From our debate it seems that there is considerable agreement in the Committee on what we should like done, and the problem is one of what wording there should be. The Minister of State has been most obliging, as he nearly always is. He was very clear in what he said on 25th March. He could hardly have been more forthright and more definite when he stated that
	<br><q><p>"a person … who advocates or takes part in violence toward another person and condones violence as a means of resolving the problem in Northern Ireland will not be protected under the provisions of the Bill."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee H,</i> 25th March 1975; c. 363.]</p></q>
But I am not quite happy about the way it seems the Minister of State wishes the matter to rest. I thought, when I heard those words uttered by him on 25th March, that he was proposing to put down some words of his own. Perhaps he will be able to do that at a later stage. But in any event the right hon. Gentleman for Down, South (Mr. Powell) and his hon. Friends have done the Committee a service by putting down Amendment No. 172.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State distinguished a little while ago between unlawful behaviour—the phrase in the amendment—and violence. Let us suppose that two persons with equal qualifications apply for a job. Should we really think it wrong of an employer to discriminate against one of those two persons if his political opinions would lead him to advocate a disruption of the factory? I do not mean in furtherance of some trade dispute but to coerce the constitutional authorities of the State, or even—we have heard mutterings of this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
kind—to destroy the political system known as direct rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one would want to condone discrimination against someone who had renounced violence and turned away from unlawful politics, and that was another point made by the Minister of State. But, surely, such a person would no longer be holding a political opinion which included the advocacy, support or expression of approval of unlawful behaviour, so I am not clear about the difficulty in the right hon. Gentleman's mind on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will address his mind very seriously again to the question. We are all agreed on what we want. It is a question of wording, and I believe it is within the capacity of the right hon. Gentleman and his Department to produce a satisfactory answer that can be incorporated in the Bill and not just leave it at the very welcome statement he made, which has been recorded in the 	<i>Official Report.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I come to a conclusion on the amendment, perhaps I might take advantage of the interventions of the hon. Members for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) and for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) once again to encapsulate what the right hon. Gentleman is to address his mind to in consideration of the subject-matter of Amendment No. 172. I quote his own words. He said "The agency will have to decide." We know that, and we accept it. For good or ill, that is implicit in the whole concept of the Bill. But what we are saying—all three of us are saying it—is that we must give the agency some instructions. This matter is so important that we cannot leave it completely at large for the agency to say that responsibility without something in the statute which gives it backing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case which the hon. Member for Belfast, West cited, which I would not have ventured to mention but which he can, let us suppose that the individual in question is an applicant for a job. He is not to be discriminated against on grounds of political opinion. There is in that case, or may still be at some future time, an element present which is not that of political opinion in the sense which we are all using the phrase. We want that element to be so referred to in the Bill that the agency has the means—has the support, as it were—as well as the direction of applying its
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>526</span>
mind to that criterion should any such case arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 165, in page 42, line 3, after "absence", insert "or supposed absence"—[	<i>Mr. Powell</i>].</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to mention briefly my reservations on subsection (3)—
	<br><q><p>"In this Act any reference to failure to provide equality of opportunity includes a reference to unintentional failure."</p></q>
In other words, any reference to discrimination includes a reference to unintentional discrimination. In those two lines are, perhaps, inherent some of the more sinister aspects of the Bill, because it would be under this interpretation that, when the agency has been unable to establish that there has been positive direct discrimination, on the basis of a head count or some other exercise it could be alleged that there had been discrimination and although it was unintentional that is no excuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thoughts immediately spring to my mind about the individual I met here last week, who would immediately deny—and I would accept his denial—that he discriminated in the offer of employment, but he employs 57 people of one religious persuasion. It may have been that inadvertently he has been guilty of discrimination. At least, if we accept this subsection he will be. On the basis of a head count, and 57 people of one denomination and none of the other, there is unintentional discrimination, so he is guilty of discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That whole concept of converting into something unintentional what I have always thought of as a positive, deliberate intentional act—because, if discrimination is anything, surely it is something thought out and positively and deliberately done—is something that I deeply regret. It is almost a contradiction in itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to refer now to the content of Clause 57 not because I feel that it could be improved by the inclusion of certain amendments which I unsuccessfully put forward, but because I am concerned about a couple of points in these interpretations. As an interpretation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0291">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>527</span>
clause, it is probably about the most comprehensive that most of us in this Committee have seen in any Bill. I cannot recall ever having seen so many specific terms included in an interpretation clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to contracts, at the top of page 39, line 1, surely we cannot approve a clause which states that a
	<br><q><p>"'contract', includes any contract, whether in writing or oral, express or implied;"</p></q>
Surely we cannot regard as a contract an undertaking given by two people in private, without witnesses? But according to the contents of this specific interpretation, "contract" does mean that. I think we need some explanation from the Minister in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that "employer", on page 39, means
	<br><q><p>"(	<i>a</i>) in relation to a person who is seeking employment, anybody who has employment available;"</p></q>
I should be grateful if the Minister would say a word about one of the most important industries and the situation of a very important group in Northern Ireland, namely, those engaged in agriculture. I do not think that they and their industry have occupied the attention of the Committee at all. I should like the Minister to recognise that it is an important sector of employment where often it involves just a farmer and his family. Indeed, in Northern Ireland most farms do not have any paid farm workers. However, I should like a confirmation from the Minister that an employer, as defined in line 18, means a farmer who may be in the rare position, in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
Northern Ireland, of offering work to paid employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 40 another peculiarity of the clause meets my eye. I should be grateful if the Minister would explain why the financial year in Northern Ireland ends on 31st March, yet in the rest of the United Kingdom it ends on 5th April and, for the interest of the Committee, it also ends on 5th April in the Republic of Ireland. Why, in this interpretation of a financial year, do we have a financial year ending on 31st March? It seems very strange, and I should like the Minister to explain it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome particularly the interpretation of the word "notice". In Clause 57 it means a notice in writing. The hon. Member pointed out earlier, when we had a debate on an earlier clause about its application, that in the interpretation clause the word "notice" meant a notice in writing. I am not altogether happy with this interpretation clause. I should have liked to see additions to it. I am not happy with some of its contents and I should like the Minister to look at the interpretation of "financial year".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
