	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>NEW TOWNS (AMENDMENT) BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the New Towns (Amendment) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. John Silkin.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Broadly speaking, the Minister's proposal is acceptable to us. It seems a reasonable timetable. The Bill is important, and there are a number of matters which we want to discuss; we shall be probing the Government about their general strategy on new towns, because that is an important subject: there seems to be some doubt about what the future holds for new towns and a question whethr we have come to the end of the experiment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I take this opportunity of asking if it is possible for the Committee to meet on the Committee Corridor? Although the chairs and furniture in this Room are elegant, it is more convenient, for many logistic reasons, to meet nearer the other Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are first on the list to move to the Committee Corridor as soon as a Room becomes available, but there are about 20 Committees sitting at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the New Towns (Amendment) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first amendment I would remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill. Copies are available in the Room. I would inform the Committee immediately that I propose to amend the provisional selection of amendments by making a separate selection for Amendment No. 12, 13, 14 and 41; so Amendments No. 9, 10 and 11 will be taken together, and Amendments No. 12, 13, 14 and 41 will be taken together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>TRANSFER OF HOUSING AND ASSOCIATED PROPERTY, ETC., TO DISTRICT COUNCILS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 11, after 'or', insert 'with agreement'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Primarily this part of this clause makes good sense. It refers to the districts "in which the dwellings are situated". Our amendment is largely a probing amendment. When adjoining districts are involved we must recognise that not all local authorities will welcome the transfer of resources and the implications that go with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial implications will be discussed during debates on Clauses 8 and 9 and there will be considerable reservations about those clauses, reservations which mainly involve districts which are not involved in new towns. In the not too distant future there may be certain boundary changes. Modifications are still being made, local government election changes are being made, and others are pending. In addition, there are possible, peculiar circumstances in which a local authority may wish to take over certain dwellings from an adjacent authority. It seems to us that that should not take place if there is disagreement. Agreement with the local authority involved should be obtained before a decision is made. The local authority should not be railroaded. I hope that the Minister will assure us that adjoining district councils will not be forced to assent. The amendment would ensure that such a transfer will take place with the good will and willingness of all those concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Planning and Local Government (Mr. John Silkin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy with the point which has been made by the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris). I hope that, in return for that sympathy, he will give me a little sympathy because of the difficulty I am in. Whilst it is true that a major district council should not railroad a minor district council, it is equally wrong for a minor local district council whose locus is small, perhaps concerned with only 20 to 30 houses, to be in a position to railroad a major authority by refusing to agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
This is a subject which has to be tackled by means of common sense, and I hope that it will be. The administrative way of dealing with it is probably right in the circumstances. Having looked at the amendment in advance I have made a check and I have found that, as far as the first generation towns are concerned, there is only one case in which this possibility might arise. That is the case of Crawley; there is an agreement with Horsham District Council, which has a minor interest in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the hon. Member for Northampton, South will accept my undertaking that we will see that there is no railroading and that as much consent as possible is obtained. If there were difficulties involving 20 houses, one could put that right by adjusting district council boundaries, but the spirit will be that of agreement. The whole spirit of the Bill is that all parties should agree. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider withdrawing his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to take up one part of the Minister's remarks. Is it possible or appropriate to think of adjustments to district boundaries for this purpose? District authorities cover more than housing and it sounds improbable, on the face of it, that one could adjust boundaries simply to meet the needs which the Minister has described. Such action would cause resentment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For first generation towns we are dealing with a hypothetical question, except for the case of Crawley. We are considering a kind of dent or bump which is a bit awkward in that all the housing in a particular area may have gone from a New Town to a district council. There may be a few houses proposed for the wrong area, which are transferred to district council A when theoretrically they should be within the boundary of district council B. That is the sort of situation which the Boundary Commission is considering under the terms of the Local Government Act. That is all that I meant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hordern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the area mentioned is in my constituency I wish to comment on it. The growth of Crawley New Town has proceeded towards Horsham and Dart of the new town area is now made up of the south-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
western part of my constituency, including Broadfield Estate and Bewbush. They are still part of the area of Horsham District Council. That is unsatisfactory for both councils. It appears that Horsham will be responsible for the rates on householders who live in part of Crawley New Town itself. I hope that the situation will not remain as it is for long, that the local boundary inspectors will see that the position is unsatisfactory, and that they will adjust the boundaries accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) in making clear that we feel strongly that arrangements should be made by agreement between the respective councils. Sometimes such agreement is not easy to obtain. It is not always obvious that a new town needs to expand in a particular direction. That has always been acknowledged as a problem. The amendment is important. Such action should only be taken when there is agreement between the two neighbouring councils. I would like to think that it will not be a problem. It has not been a problem, but it has caused delay in negotiations between Horsham and Crawley.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would be widely accepted, particularly by the two councils which I represent. I hope that the Minister will consider our amendment sympathetically. I hope that the remarks made during this short debate will be noted by interested parties and that it will not be long before the Boundary Commission makes a suitable adjustment. I hope that there will be no question of an arbitary takeover by one council of another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to accuse the Minister of being disingenuous in saying that he was only able to trace one new town which covers more than one council boundary. There have been suggestions that Redditch should expand not only into a neighbouring district council area, but into a neighbouring county. It has been suggested to me that representatives from that county should be awarded a seat on the board of the Developing Corporation. Whilst it is true that there is only one council involved at the moment, that will not necessarily be the position in the future, and that adds force to our recommendation that there should be agreement in this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Minister further. I am grateful for the research he has undertaken on the first generation new towns. If the case he mentioned were to be the only one in the future we might be tempted to give way, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) has said, it could be different for second generation towns. Clause 2 provides that they should come forward earlier than the norm. There are a number of such cases in my constituency. There is a new town, part of which lies within the area of another district council. In such circumstances it is important that there should be agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such agreements will involve finance. It is the financial basis that will be the determining factor. It is a matter for negotiation between the districts till, with their respective new towns, they get to a final arrangement that they find satisfactory. We know that occasionally final agreements have to be second best. It may well be that in certain circumstances that will arise here. It is important that we get agreement, and that we leave it to the parties to get an agreement that they will find satisfactory and leave room for manoeuvre, particularly for the smaller authority which, perhaps, might get a marginally better deal than it would normally have expected if it were on a straight proportional basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that this is not the ideal place to meet that need. If the Minister will give an undertaking that he will look at it in relation to this amendment, perhaps for somewhere else in the Bill, I will treat that with sympathy, but I think there is a genuine problem here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one other question which, I must confess, I have only just spotted. The clause talks about
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Council of the district in which the dwellings are situated or any adjoining district."</p></blockquote>
How does one define, where the dwellings are situated in more than one district, which council it is in whose area the dwellings are situated? In a sense, the logic of this ought to lead to something like "applications to any district in which the dwellings are situated".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a problem about what is meant by "adjoining". If one is not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
clear what is the prinicipal council one is talking about, if there are several councils concerned, then presumably any council area adjoining to a district in which there are new town dwellings can be held to be adjoining. It does seem to me that it is necessary that the adjoining district should actually have dwellings situated there. Essentially what I am trying to get at here, although I see the kind of common sense of this, is a matter of legality. It would make more sense to say simply "transferred to a district council in which there are dwellings".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to deal with one or two points made by hon. Members before I tackle the last two points of substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy with the hon. Member for Horsham and Crawley (Mr. Hordern), because if I did not, as I am his pair, he might not be willing to pair with me when I might want him to, but also because of the substance of his argument. No Minister can influence the Boundary Commission. Sometimes it is said even that God cannot. Certainly a Minister cannot. I hope it will have noted what the hon. Member has said, but I cannot tell it what to do, and I would not dream of doing so. The interesting point about the Crawley-Horsham situation is that it arose before this Bill was in existence. It is a situation that exists anyway. In a sense the Bill makes it neither more positive nor negative. It is a simple illustration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as Redditch is concerned I hope the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) will not think I am disingenuous. I am not certain whether it is a good thing or a bad thing to be disingenuous. Whatever is bad, I hope he will not think it of me. As much as I love and as he loves Redditch, it is a second generation town and not a first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the points made by the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) about second generation towns—yes, it could happen, I do agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the point made by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison), I am not sure, as an ex-lawyer, that I like the idea that the Bill is a commonsense Bill and everybody knows what it means though lawyers—poor boobs—will not understand it. However, I take the point he is making. I think that if one were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
going to look at this I would not want to look at it in this particular situation in the Bill. The hon. Member for Northampton, South is right. Possibly Clause 3(1) might be the place where one might look at it. I will take it away and look at it again. After all, this is the first amendment, and if one cannot be a little gracious on the first amendment where can one? I will take a look at it and see whether we can meet the principle without at the same time giving so much of a veto to the local authority that it would render the whole thing worthless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for saying he will have another look at this. The major point is the one about the second generation new towns. The first generation is not a matter of major concern and we are not greatly worried about it. If it is the case that in subsequent generations there is a new town where a very substantial proportion of the area covered by the new town belongs to what in this terminology is called "an adjoining district" there is a real problem of consent. It would be wrong to unload on districts which might be unwilling or unable to take them fairly substantial numbers of houses under this procedure. I hope that before this short debate ends the Minister can give an assurance that there will be a lot of consideration given to this point about second generation towns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am wondering if a better word would be "contiguous" instead of "adjoining" although I do see there is a difficulty where one gets part of a district council area approaching the area of corporation houses which is adjoining but which is not contiguous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. I do not want to go rushing to the Oxford Dictionary to see the difference between "adjoining" and "contiguous". I have often thought what a marvellous language we have inherited, one that has Anglo-Saxon and Latin derivatives, and the word "adjoining" a mixture of the two. I think that on the whole my hon. Friend and hon. Members opposite should not look a gift horse too much in the mouth. I will have a look at the points that have been made. If I feel something ought to be done to meet the principle without
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
destroying the point which I made, I will bring something forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way the right hon. Gentleman has listened to our arguments. It would help us if we could have an indication of the second generation case—of how many districts may be involved, or how many occasions there might be when more than one district might be involved. It would help us in our deliberations if we could have some such factual information as that. Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, although we all know what we are talking about when we talk about "transferred dwellings", in fact the law might apply it rather differently if it were to examine it. "Transferred dwellings" means in law dwellings that have actually been transferred, but there are dwellings that will be proposed to be transferred at a particular moment in time. I will give an illustration. A scheme is put forward and a scheme is approved. At that particular moment the word "transferred", in law, would not apply, because there are dwellings proposed to be transferred at that stage. The word "transferred" would only apply when the dwellings have themselves been vested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just to add even greater complication, we use "transferred" throughout the Bill but I regret to say that when we talk, for example, in Clause 2 about transferring from the development corporation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
to the New Towns Commission we are actually talking about a transfer that took place under the terms of previous legislation and not this legislation. This is calculated to befuddle the mind of any judge of the High Court throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We propose to try and defuddle the minds of Her Majesty's judges and of everybody else and to say that the word "transferred" shall apply in this Bill
	<br><blockquote><p>"except where the context otherwise requires".</p></blockquote>
After "transferred" shall in the appropriate places be added the words "or proposed to be transferred".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, as a result of this, there will be, if the Committee will decide, as I hope it will decide, to pass these amendments, a large number of consequentials which will pop up like daisies in clauses we have not yet reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon.

It seems to me that what the Minister has said makes good sense and I do not want to quarrel with that, but I would like to draw his attention to the fact that the first of the three amendments he is proposing consists of the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"except where the context otherwise requires".</p></blockquote>
If anything was ever designed to introduce fuddledom, if there be such a word, that wording is calculated to do it. I can understand what he said about the need to talk about transferring in the future as opposed to transferred in the past, but how on earth are we to know whether the context will require or not require a particular meaning? It seems an extraordinarily vague piece of proposed legislation that the Minister has put forward. I think he owes a little bit of explanation of the points in this Bill where the context does otherwise require. How on earth are we to know what that means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This subsection refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"property, rights, liabilities and obligations of a new town corporation".</p></blockquote>
We are concerned with the exact meaning of the words we seek to delete by this amendment. It is clear that the early part of the wording is about the interest of the corporation in any land occupied—that is, presumably at the date of the Royal Assent. The phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"or set aside for occupation or use"</p></blockquote>
is not clear to us. It is not clear what sort of land we are concerned with here. Are we concerned with land owned by the development corporation at this point of time? Are we concerned with land within the designated area of the new town? Are we concerned with what is technically called "white land", in other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0384">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
words, land for which the development corporation may have sought to find a use, and then had left its options open? Are we concerned with land that may appear on a county structure plan as, roughly, within an area of interest for a new town?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause as it stands is very sweeping, very extensive, and it is not clear what extent of land is involved; it is not clear whether it is restricted to housing land. I suspect it is not. We would seek clarification, whether it involves non-housing land. One could see the situation arising where this Bill primarily affects housing. We have a late amendment to try to define more precisely those parts of the land which are to be transferred. There land could be in the category of commercial or quasi-commercial land. There is a lack of clarity of the full meaning of this short phrase, the implications of which are very sweeping indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's fears can be allayed to a very great degree. We have to see this Bill in context. We are talking about the transfer of dwellings. One cannot stop at the transfer of dwellings, because certain things may have a different use altogether from housing. There may be the odd corner shop, the little playground, the amenity area, and so on, which inevitably come with it and would be transferred. Later, we will find that the test is whether it is of benefit to the town in general or restricted to the benefit of the dwellers in a particular locality. It is the second test that we have used. If one realises that is the basis of it, it becomes much clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to safeguard the situation where dwellings have already been erected and where there is a certain amount of land which may be contiguous and which has been set aside for development in connection with the dwellings. For example, there may be a bank of lock-up garages, or hard standing provided for the cars belonging to the occupants of the dwellings, garden sheds, perambulator sheds, or land which is for landscaping. These parcels of land, obviously very small ones, have been set aside for the use or occupation of the people living in the dwellings that are to be transferred. That is all that is involved. If we say only "set aside for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
occupation" we cut out this sort of desirable transfer of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for that reason that I would suggest to the hon. Gentleman, while I understand his feelings in this matter, he has in fact misjudged the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would press the Minister a little further on the question of in-fill sites, for instance. They may be regarded by the inhabitants at the moment as set aside for their occupation or use, but they may have been intended by the corporation for the provision of old people's homes, single-parent family homes, or for other groups. It is not clear to me from what he has been saying whether these in-fill sites would be included in the land set aside in this way. I will develop later on, in another context, the possible planning implications that may arise, on which I made some remarks during the Second Reading debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I hope we can reassure the hon. Gentleman, if he turns to subsection (3)(	<i>e</i>), which is a distinct and separate paragraph dealing with in-fill sites.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation. He is now saying this is land that, in a sense, has been formally developed in association with the dwelling. It has been formally made over to open space, garages, sheds or associated works of that nature. The problem is that "set aside for", although it may come appropriately under paragraph (	<i>e</i>), does not suggest to a layman that it has necessarily formally to be associated with that paragraph. If I have the Minister's assurance that it has formally to do with the dwellings, then I would know how to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the words "set aside for the development in question" would meet the hon. Gentleman's point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stanley Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 12, after 'facilities', insert 'goods and services'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept all that is in the clause. This amendment raises the question whether it covers all the assets which should be transferred. The issue which has caused a certain amount of concern, particularly among people dealing with the transfer of new town assets over a long period, is that of neighbourhood shops. Does the word "facilities" cover neighbourhood shops? I think it might be very much clearer if the words "goods and services" were added, because a neighbourhood shop might not be held to be a facility. It would save confusion later if it were explicit in the Bill that it is dealing with the transfer of facilities of assets which provide goods and services. The amendment is moved in a probing sense, to make quite clear what many of us feel is important—that neighbourhood shops should be included within the terms of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this question. It enables me to put a number of fears at rest. What my hon. Friend is talking about is, perhaps, not merely the transfer of the small shop that goes with the housing; it may be a parade of shops. I agree that this is right. I not only have every sympathy with him but I am determined that it shall be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether we have covered that by the use of the word "facility". Rather curiously, if one were to add the words "goods and services", that would have a restrictive effect. Its effect would be to say that a development corporation could transfer only those shops which it was personally managing. If my hon. Friend were to re-read it in his mind, with those words added, he would see the point I am making. If the word "facilities" enables one to transfer not only the shop but the whole parade of shops, and it is the right word—that is what I believe and what my advice is—I would hope my hon. Friend would be able to withdraw the amendment, satisfied we have looked into the point. We are not only sympathetic with the idea: we intend that it shall be carried out, and that, therefore the clause, as it stands, is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) asked specifically that this should enable neighbourhood shops to be transferred. The Stevenage working party report on the transfer of assets has been of great value to everybody interested in the subject. It sets out its philosophy for shopping in paragraph 3.15.
	<br><blockquote><p>"In a new town the development corporation build and manage shops in accordance with an integrated shopping strategy, with a hierarchy of groupings from the town centre, through district and neighbourhood centres, down to small parades of shops and single shops in residential areas."</p></blockquote>
It is saying there are three kinds of shops to be found in a new town. There is the big centre to the new town, the district and neighbourhood centres, and then one comes down to the truly local shops which are very much housing-associated shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, in moving the amendment, asked for confirmation that the word "facilities" covered the middle category. the neighbourhood area. I believe that if this were so it would be wrong in principle. I also believe that it would be rather contrary to the spirit of the Bill. When the Minister gave the hon. Gentleman his assurance that it would or could cover neighbourhood shops, I felt that he was giving an assurance which was rather undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "facilities" is remarkably vague. I shall not say again that I am not a lawyer, because I know what the Minister will say—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not any more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —but I must say that the distinctions between the meanings of words such as "facilities" and "goods and services" are very hard to follow unless we spend our lives immersed in this sort of jargon. On the face of it, I cannot see why "goods and services" should refer to one kind of thing and "facilities" to another. No doubt, custom has grown up through the centuries in drafting practice which has dictated that "goods and services" means certain things and that "facilities" can mean whatever one likes. Will the Minister comment on whether it is desirable and appropriate that the neighbourhood shops should be regarded as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0386">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
housing-related assets, and give us a little more definition of the meaning of "facilities", as understood in his own mind and in the minds of the people who draft and administer legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we have to get back to first principles here. What sort of transfer are we talking about? If we go back to the consultative document we find that what is suggested is a possible future for commercial and industrial assets of new towns. Generally speaking we find agreement on both sides that housing assets ought to go from the development corporation to the democratically elected district council, but inevitably certain assets and facilities which are related to those actual dwellings must inevitably go with them. If this provision does not exist we get into the most awful mess. Therefore it is logical that this should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whereas the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) seems to have three categories, I have only two, on the basis of this first principle. What we are not transferring are those assets which are of benefit to the generality of the inhabitants of the new town. What we shall be transferring will be those assets which are related to the dwellings to be transferred. It is a matter of fact and common sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promise never to mention lawyers again in these proceedings, and the hon. Gentleman agrees with me on that. Let us stick to common sense. Common sense dictates that we look at a shop or a parade of shops and ask ourselves who is served by it. If it serves virtually in its entirety the people in the houses to be transferred, obviously it ought to be transferred to the district council. If, on the other hand, it is a parade of shops or a centre which is for the benefit of the town as a whole, clearly it will remain with the town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be a matter of common sense, and no doubt of some argument between the development corporation, the district council and the Minister. Basically it will be a common sense decision that will decide it, and I do not think that there will be as much difficulty as the hon. Member for Aylesbury seems to visualise. That is why I changed my hon. Friend's expression from one shop to a parade of shops, because it might
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
be that, and there might be all sorts of other facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only question is whether we have covered that possibility in the drafting of the Bill, and I am satisfied that we have. I hope that the hon. Member for Aylesbury, when he considers it, will see that it is a common sense decision. The question to be asked is whether it is of benefit to the inhabitants of the town as a whole, or purely, or very largely, to the people who live in the dwellings to be transferred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that there is not a third tier? The very local shops could supply a particular housing estate, and a shopping centre may supply the whole of a town. Recently I saw such a shopping centre which served the whole of Telford, including the largest Sainsbury's in the country. Is the Minister saying that between the very local shops and a centre such as that at Telford there is not a kind of intermediate tier of shops which is commonly called the neighbourhood community? If our legislation is to be on common sense lines—and we are all united in agreeing that it should be—ought we not to recognise that there is a neighbourhood tier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that when it comes to considering a third tier or sphere it will be a question of fact, and we shall have to adopt a little common sense. Life is full of such problems. My noble Friend the late Lord Attlee once remarked that one might find it difficult to define something but a little common sense could show very clearly what it was. He gave the illustration of an elephant, which he regarded as an animal impossible to define. Nevertheless, he said, if one were to come into the room one would know what it was. Obviously there will be the sort of shop which, everyone will agree, is bound to go with the dwellings. There will also be the large central shopping area, and everyone will agree that it was not designed for the immediate inhabitants. There will also be some shops which are, as it were, in the middle, and common sense, a very desirable quality, will need to be applied in such cases. But there is no reason why we should worry at the moment about defining something that will be decided as a pure question of fact as and when it arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) means about three categories of shops, but, like my right hon. Friend, I do not think it is useful for us in the Committee to draw distinctions between the three varieties. I think that the operative distinction we need to make is between those shops which are to cater for the town as a whole, and may be for people outside the town, and those which serve a particular neighbourhood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly anxious that the issue should be raised whether the term "facilities" included neighbourhood shops. I know that many people outside the House who are concerned with the question of transfer are also extremely anxious to know what is the situation. I am not a lawyer, and I am aware that the term "facilities" may mean to me something it may not mean to people who are concerned with the strict interpretation of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of my right hon. Friend's assurance that the type of asset with which we are concerned, namely, neighbourhood shops, is encompassed by the term "facilities", and in view of the fact, therefore, that it is far from being any obstruction to or limitation on the transfer of the type of asset one has in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I need not detain the Committee very long on this technical amendment. There have been in the past, and no doubt will be in the future, a number of cases in which the development corporation has disposed of interests in dwellings or lands freehold, and with them, of course, has retained certain restrictive rights, covenants and obligations, such as the right to repurchase in certain cases, and so on. When we looked at the Bill again, we found that, while we had ensured—I think it is covered by paragraph (	<i>d</i>)—that these rights, covenants and so on could go from the development corporation to the district council in the case of leasehold property, we had failed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
to do so in the case of freehold property, and that, therefore, we might have the rather ridiculous situation that the party which had the right to enforce restrictive covenants and obligations of one sort and another might be separate from the area in which most of the dwellings would be. This amendment seeks to put that matter right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to have clarification on one point, however. It may not arise under this subsection, but I have had a case recently in my own new town where a restrictive covenant was imposed and representations were made to the development corporation, as a result of which it is anticipated that the covenant will be changed. Will the provision of the amendment mean that any changes sought by those who are involved will now be moved straight on to the district council, and that negotiations will be conducted with the new authority to whom the transfer is made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

primary purpose of the Bill, as set out at the opening of the subsection, which talks about
	<br><blockquote><p>"property, rights, liabilities and obligations</p></blockquote>
associated with any transferred dwellings. We are concerned with the transferred dwellings. Paragraph (	<i>e</i>) is very sweeping indeed, and seems to anticipate action in the future. The Minister has mentioned that one of the areas of interest is in-fill sites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with the word "interest", which is the second word in paragraph (	<i>e</i>). Exactly what is an interest? I am none too clear whether an interest means that it is actually owned at the date of Royal Assent. Does it involve a situation in which a local authority—this may happen at the fringes—is in the process of collecting land or changing the nature of its development? In my new town at the moment there is a small plot of land which everybody thought was designated as open space, as indeed it was, but planning approval has now suddenly turned up for four dwellings on this land. I do not apologise for raising the matter of white land, because white land is the problem land with the new towns. While it is supposed to be associated with any transferred dwellings, the provision could, at the fringes, be concerned with white land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is whether this paragraph is necessary. If it is concerned only with in-filling, it is much too sweeping. If it is not, I question whether this is the appropriate place for it. Paragraph (	<i>e</i>) refers to paragraphs (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>). Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) deals with land held by a corporation and presumably means land actually owned by the corporation at the moment. It goes on to provide a definition and is generally quite clear. However, paragraph (	<i>c</i>) refers to property rights held by the corporation for the administration of the estate, or servicing or otherwise in connection with any transferred property. A district council may not need that and may not wish to receive it. I wonder whether that paragraph is not also too sweeping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is essentially a probing amendment, but we wish to probe the matter deeply because worries have been expressed to us, and the more we think about this subject, the more we see cir-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
cumstances in which the paragraph could be used adversely. If its sole purpose is to cover in-fill sites, it seems far too sweeping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) has raised what is essentially a probing amendment and I understand his intention has been to voice the fears and worries which have been expressed to him that the clause may be too sweeping and go too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am assured that the clause covers the in-fill sites of which he spoke. Paragraph (	<i>e</i>) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any interest of the corporation in land awaiting development as part of an estate."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise the words: "as part of an estate". It is clearly limited to in-fill sites and not to land which may happen to be adjoining an estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member also asked about the meaning of the word "interest" in the paragraph. It means having an actual property right in the land—generally speaking land held by a corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that the hon. Member is interested in the possibility of in-fill sites being transferred in the normal way because in Amendment No. 41 he lists in-fill sites as one of the things he regards it as necessary to transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I have reassured him that the intention of the clause is merely to enable in-fill sites to be transferred as part of the estate to which they belong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a few words on Amendments No. 10 and 11. My fears are not those of the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris). I am concerned that the paragraph may not be sweeping enough and may not cover every contingency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, parcels of land may be excluded for reasons which are not apparent at present. If there are reasons for which land could be excluded, they should be clearly spelled out. Land adjacent to an estate may, for legal reasons, be held not to be part of it. Can the Minister assure us that, when the Bill becomes law, there will be no possibility of exemptions being made, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
that all the estates which could be used for development in future will be covered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I am intervening rather often in this debate, but my hon. Friend's points, though dealing with land, are different from those raised by the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris). I am advised that the words "planning designation" in Amendment No. 11 have no meaning in law, and that amendment, therefore, does not need a detailed reply. It adds nothing to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point is involved in Amendment No. 10 and it is important that I should try to explain it to the Committee. The inclusion of land adjacent to estates which are being transferred in the category of rented housing related assets would enable large areas of housing land reserve to be transferred, under a transfer scheme, from a new town corporation to a district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of this kind of amendment is that if large tracts of land were to be transferred under a transfer scheme, this could frustrate the purposes of a new town corporation continuing to be involved in the development of second generation towns in particular. The difficulty may not arise in towns like Harlow or Hemel Hempstead, but it could happen in towns where considerable development is taking place. If a tract of land were transferred to a district council, the authority, having obtained control and ownership of the land, might be unwilling or unable to develop it in line with the general plan of the new town corporation for the development of the town as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely understand the anxiety of councillors and some of my hon. Friends to see increasing responsibilities given to district councils and elected bodies, but there are reasons why the transfer of land of the kind which could result from the amendment would not be a good thing. First, it would be done at outstanding loan debt and would enable district councils which could acquire land in a new town area to obtain it at a very low price, compared with the prices which councils which were not in new town corporation areas would have to pay. This would naturally cause considerable resentment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
It is not impossible for land to be transferred if it is thought desirable. There is provision for this under both the New Towns Act 1965 and the Community Land Act. However, such a provision is inappropriate in a Bill which is primarily concerned with the transfer of housing and related assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that explains why the Government cannot accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Under-Secretary on his appointment and on his appearance in the Committee. I also thank him for some of his remarks, though I had a little difficulty in following them all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agreed with what he was saying about the difficulties in regard to Amendment No. 10. What happens when an in-fill site is transferred to a district council which does not wish to develop it or even wishes to reduce the target population of the new town? A council may not wish to provide housing, or, alternatively, may wish to develop land now and leave no provision for second generation families. In the new town in my area sites are reserved for later development for second generation families. What is the planning situation when a district council takes over from a development corporation? After a transfer the council may decide that land set aside for housing for sale should be used for housing for rent or vice versa. Who would ensure that the original plan for the new town will be carried out?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My subsidiary point concerns the phraseology of the clause. I am a layman and trespassing on legal matters, but I have been advised by some general managers that, for example, the meaning of "estate" is not clear. I hope I have not roused a mare's nest, but there is no definition of "estate" in the Bill. The word has a clear legal meaning in another context, but is it the same in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am not being semantic but in subsection (3) and in other subsections of the clause there are references to "property, rights, liabilities and obligations", "property and rights" and "rights, liabilities and obligations". Will the Minister assure us that these words have been carefully examined and that the differences in the words in the subsections are intentional? It is not clear
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
to a number of people what is the intention in the choice of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can we have an assurance that the intention of paragraph (	<i>e</i>) is to give effect to paragraph 14 of the consultative document? If that is the case, is the Minister satisfied that it will have that effect, because we are not sure that it will?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joseph Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rights of second generation tenants have been mentioned. Will it not be difficult, once houses have been transferred to an existing authority, to expect that authority to set such standards? Once a house is transferred it should become part of the general housing stock and let according to the policies of that local authority. To attempt to introduce further 	<i>caveats</i> to suit people in a new town or to say that those houses should be reserved for them is a dangerous precedent. A small authority, for example, might be expected to take over and manage a new town housing stock significantly larger than the housing stock of the authority itself. I would be loath to see privileged tenants on a letting list. When discussing the place of new towns under democratic procedures we should say that once houses have been transferred to a local authority, that authority should be allowed to decide its own policy, provided that it does not conflict with the Government's general policy. If the Committee accepts variations to suit particular authorities or to underwrite certain guarantees for second generation tenants, I do not know where it will end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was associated with an authority which had large overspill estates. We had to fight against the theory that all relettings of the houses on the overspill estates should go to the children of tenants on the overspill estates. If we had agreed to that proposal we would have been left with only a small pocket of about 30,000 pre-war houses which were not of a high standard, to let to indigenous tenants of the area. That is a dangerous situation which I would be loath to support. It would be wrong to have a second generation of tenants with a privilege over the ordinary people who are domiciled in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what the Minister said about large tracts of land being transferred to a local authority
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
because of being adjacent, but I am particularly concerned about the small parcels of land attached to complete estates which everybody would believe should be transferred but which could be retained on the ground that they were not part of a particular estate, only adjacent to it. In that respect I have some sympathy for what the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) said about the definition of the term "estate". Within the terms of the clause as it stands it is conceivable that a piece of land, which has not been developed but which is within an almost completely developed area, might be reserved or held back. For good reasons on some occasions the Harlow Development Corporation has withheld for a number of years building on a particular piece of land which everyone thought was part of an estate. I should like an assurance that there is no loophole which would enable such a piece of land to be excluded in any transfer of Harlow. I am not seeking to expand the clause to cover huge tracts of land, but the definition of the term "estate" is important. I would be grateful for an assurance on that matter from the Minister when he deals with the other questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to be critical when I say that we have had quite an exercise in semantics. I have already defined "interest" in legal terms, and now I am asked to define "estate". I am advised that there is no satisfactory definition of that term but that it is what appears to people to be an estate. Most of us have a rough idea of what we are talking about when we refer to an estate, but clearly they vary from one new town to another. It would be a terrible reflection on new town development if that were not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is deliberately drawn fairly flexibly to cover a variety of circumstances. Our earlier debate on the subject of shops is another example of the need to be reasonably flexible. I emphasize that it is intended that there should be agreement about what needs to be done, as far as that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend and I hope that such transfer schemes will take place by agreement and that we shall not argue about the kind of issue raised by my hon.

Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean)—the small parcel of land near an estate which looks as if it is part of the estate, or that it is planned that it should be. Such a piece of land may not be in-fill between two blocks of buildings but on the edge of a development. Such a parcel of land, which is adjacent to the estate, as opposed to a large tract of land, would be covered by paragraph (	<i>e</i>). I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend on that point. He need have no fears. I do not believe that there will be many conflicts when transfer schemes take place. It is the intention of the Secretary of State, the New Town Commission and corporations, and district councils to attempt to arrive at logical and sensible solutions for both the new towns and the neighbourhoods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West raised an important matter and he went some way to answer the point made by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) about what would happen if an estate were transferred to a district council which refuses to do the intended in-filling. The answer was given by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West when he said that once an estate is transferred it is transferred. It is being transferred from an authoritarian organisation to a democratic body which will make decisions of its own accord. There could be cases in which the intentions of the new towns would be frustrated by district councils which refuse to undertake small development schemes which had been planned by the new town corporations. That could be important if it involved large tracts of land. But, in the case of estate transfers with a number of in-fill sites, or the odd parcel of land, I cannot believe that the Committee wishes to write into the Bill ways in which new town corporations can insist on jobs being done exactly in line with their original plans. District councils will, therefore, be able to make decisions for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the question raised by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch about the wording of the clause and the difference between "rights, liabilities and obligations" and "any property and rights". We will look into that to ensure that the wording makes reasonable sense. If there is any doubt
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
about it we will see that the matter is put right. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for making the Under-Secretary reply again, but I would like him to make clear that when land has been transferred the district council concerned will be able to do what it likes. Will he confirm that the council will be able to build up such an estate or not? For instance, certain estates in new towns have been built on a larger space than is customary. Will it be open to a District council to build up that area to a higher density? This matter reinforces an argument I shall make later about the necessity for the residents of new towns to be consulted before such changes take place. There could be severe repercussions for them as a result of the transfer of estates if they are to be redeveloped, or not developed. I think that I understand the Under-Secretary, but I should like him to confirm what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A district council would be constrained only by the scheme which transferred an estate to a district council. The scheme might contain certain constraints. The scheme might also contain the right for the corporation to nominate tenancies within an estate. That is referred to later in the Bill. There will be certain constraints, but anything that lies outside those in the scheme itself would leave a district council completely free to carry out policies such as those referred to by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller). It will be free to increase density or to alter plans made originally by the new town corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other words, there will be no requirement for the district council to seek planning approval as new towns must at present? The district council will not be restricted in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not unless there were a major departure from the plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. Friend agree that residents of an estate transferred to a district council would be consulted for the first time on any development or any change of development? It so often happens that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
a new town corporation estate is planned and completed without the residents being consulted, but the very fact that it is transferred from a non-accountable body to an elected body means automatically that the residents will be consulted if they so wish. They will be consulted by their councillors and express their views to their councillors. Moreover, a district authority is not authoritarian. For instance, the county council has certain powers in planning and the Minister is still in overall charge. It seems to me that hon. Members opposite are over anxious about new developments, or redevelopments, or developments which have not yet taken place. When the power is transferred it is transferred to an elected body more attuned to the wishes of the residents than the corporation ever has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) for raising the point so clearly. I hope he will agree that, following his line of argument, it would be reasonable for the residents of the new towns to be consulted themselves before such a transfer takes place. That is, perhaps, a later point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one of the difficulties about the whole of the new town programme that the new towns were originally established to fulfil national objectives which may still have some degree of conflict with local objectives. In the case of Redditch it was bitterly resisted although it was designated by a Minister on this side. It was not at all or never has been popular with the local residents. There has always been a clear possibility of conflict of interest between local and national interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole purpose of my remarks has been to establish whether there will be any continuing regard for national objectives. In other words will there still be provision for the Secretary of State to have some degree of control over the development of the new town or will it all be handed over to the district council? That is the whole purpose of my trying to probe with this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has raised an interesting point. While I understand and sympathise with the point the hon. Member for Preston,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
North (Mr. Atkins) is making about the democratically elected local authority, we are in a slightly different situation, in the sense that the whole objective of the new town is to encourage people to come from the city areas, many in London, but also in Manchester, Birmingham, and other conurbations, to come out from the difficult circumstances in which they are often living. They often have a choice of new towns to go to. For Londoners there is a whole range of choices for different kinds of skilled trades. Often they can decide between two or three new towns. From Northampton, which I represent, people have been to Peterborough, weighed up the two, and decided which one is preferable, and they come on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member was not quite fair. In Northampton, and certainly in Peterborough, the development corporations go to great lengths to describe exactly what will happen on the ground in an estate. In many cases in my experience they go far further than the local authority. They have maps and pictures and go into great detail of what is to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having attracted these families, and in certain cases if there have been commitments of the sort mentioned by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean), we face some difficulties if we then say we will transfer right across to a district council, and those commitments are completely washed aside and the plans which were previously laid, some of which have been left pending, are then cast aside. I do not know whether this clause is the right place to deal with it but it may well be that we have to consider making it mandatory on the district council to indicate whether it will change things as laid down. My hon. Friend has raised a real problem here. It is somehow marrying the two, local democracy with previous commitments to people who have moved into that town.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To pick up that point about the views of the tenants themselves, I do not claim to know what the tenants think. We have some evidence dating back a few years in the Cullingworth Report, which carried out surveys, whether tenants of the new towns wished to leave the development corporation and become tenants of the district council.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
As, no doubt, the Committee will recall, the Cullingworth Report instigated the research in four new towns, Crawley, Stevenage, Aycliffe, and East Kilbride, and found that among commission tenants in Crawley 51 per cent. said they thought the present system should continue and 28 per cent. said they thought the local authority should take over. In Stevenage 38 per cent. thought the present system should continue and 24 per cent. that the local authority should take over. In both those towns people wanted to stay put rather than be transferred. Admittedly this was some years ago. In Aycliffe the figures were different, and 33 per cent. thought the present system should continue and 46 per cent. that the local authority should take over. In East Kilbride 41 per cent. of the tenants thought the present system should continue and 39 per cent. that the local authority should take over. In three out of the four new towns surveyed at that time the tenants did not want to be transferred to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Ministers accepted so readily that they are authoritarian beasts. I thought I heard the Under-Secretary accepting that the new town is authoritarian. I am aware there is some resentment in some parts of the country at the way new town development corporations have behaved, but new towns are subject to democratic control. We would not be sitting here in this Committee if they were not subject to democratic control. It is merely that that democratic control is exercised through Parliament, and through the Minister acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, rather than through the direct democratic control of the local council. If new towns are authoritarian in their structure it is because our Ministers are authoritarian. We know that Socialist Ministers are authoritarian beings, given half a chance, but there is no reason why they should be in this instance. I am sure the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) regards his Ministers as being not quite Fascist pigs but somewhat authoritarian. The Under-Secretary has admitted being authoritarian. There are two different levels of democracy here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) has made some remarkable statements. One is that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
the new town corporation is subject to democratic control. If the hon. Member means that, he is using the term in a most wide sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many hon. Members on both sides have again and again made objections to certain decisions which corporations have made cutting right across the wishes of the existing community. Again and again we have had the answer the Minister is bound to give, "I cannot interfere with the day-to-day management of the corporation." Day-to-day management is a wide term and includes practically anything. However perfect the Minister may be it is difficult for him to deal personally with so many decisions that are made by the corporations armed as they are with a large body of people, very often including some of the strongest bureaucrats in the country. Hon. Members opposite often speak against bureaucracy, but certainly these are large ones in our midst. They are basically authoritarion and unaccountable, certainly to the ordinary elected representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member quotes opinion polls, as a substitute for democratic elections, it seems. Let us remember that some of the greatest expressions of opposition by existing communities in an area taken over by a new town corporation is that the people who come into the area, however needy they may be, have advantages over existing residents when it comes to getting tenancies of houses. There is a great deal of conflict in the community because of this. Naturally, the people who come into the new towns are privileged. Hon. Members opposite have pointed out how they are privileged. They have an opportunity of selecting which new town they are going to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish the residents of the area taken over by the new town had such powers of selection when they are looking for council houses. In many cases they are told where to go, and there are long waiting lists for people wanting such houses. One of the purposes of the Bill is to enable those people to be satisfied. The hon. Member for Aylesbury wants to continue the division in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say I wanted that. I made clear at Second Reading that I accepted the principle underlying

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
the Bill. I am not attempting to dispute it, but I was provoked by some of the comments from hon. Members opposite to point out there is not quite this feeling for democratic control in the local communities. The hon. Member is suggesting there is, and also springs to the defence of Ministers who seem to me to have a responsibility, which is formally embodied in this document, which is the Reports of the Development Corporations, which are published every year and which are a physical expression of the fact that the development corporations are accountable to Parliament. It is a pity that we do not spend more time looking at these things. It is a pity that many of the things that happen in the name of Parliament are not discussed adequately in the House. May be we should look at our Committee procedure—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is going beyond the stage of an intervention and making a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nevertheless, despite what the hon. Member says, the implication is there when he refers to these opinion polls and these privileged people who may not want to transfer to a new organisation in which their privileges will vanish and in which will be treated as equals with other members of their new community. The implication is there. The hon. Member wants to stereotype and keep the pattern of difference between one community which is privileged and another which is not, instead of requiring them to share in the responsibilities and the difficulties of the whole community on an equal basis. It is the strength of this Bill that it makes this change, and it is right that the Bill as it has been framed in this regard should go through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maureen Colquhoun</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that we have been seeing some fine blue herrings this morning from hon. Members opposite. I would ask how many Tory local authorities have ever heard of the Cullingworth Report, let alone acted upon it. There were very many excellent things contained in it on tenants' rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has to be realistic. From a tenant's point of view, the development corporation as local author-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
ity is still a bureaucracy. In the end it comes down to the responsibility of the elected representatives within the community. I am certain that in Northampton, where, because it is a labour-controlled authority, the community is consulted on planning matters and on almost every aspect of what the council is doing, they will be considerably better off by having the responsibility with the district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cullingworth Report set out so many good things. I was a minority member of a Tory council many years ago when the report first came out and it was completely ignored by the local Tories. It seems to me an extraordinary thing to see it held up now during the work of this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a few questions which I should like the Minister to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intervention from the hon. Lady the Member for Northampton, North (Ms. Colquhoun) is an interesting one. I am not sure which Cullingworth Report she is referring to, certainly not the one which dealt with the ownership and management of new towns. Presumably she is talking about the one which dealt with tenants. Perhaps she is confused, and should look at both reports in order to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>M/s Colquhoun</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not play politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot resist saying there are only 10 days left for Labour in Northampton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I add my strong personal congratulations to the hon. Gentleman the Under-Secretary? I have seen him at work, night and day, and have seen his capacity for work. We do congratulate him most sincerely, and look forward to working with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for his defining "interest". We would have been helped if we had had a definition of an estate. The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) raised a valid point as he explained it, as opposed to how it reads in the amendment. These words may not be appropriate, but perhaps it should be considered if we are talking about an estate which is already developed or designated. The new towns are quite efficient in introducing detailed maps which indicate the designations of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
estates. There is confusion when the word "estate" is not defined. It may be we need to add such words as an "already designated" or "already developed" estate. Would the hon. Gentleman at least give an undertaking to look at it, without committing himself at this stage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would refer again to paragraph (	<i>c</i>). As I understand it, the district authority, like it or not, has to accept, on the transferred property and land, dealing with the administration of estates. It may well be that the district council, when it comes to do its own analysis, will have a different form of rent collection and a different form of running things locally. Are the Government saying that administration has to be handed over, and then it is up to the district council whether it wants to dispose of it or not?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, my hon. Friends have raised this important point regarding commitments made to incoming tenants. It is difficult to understand why it is a privilege for some people to come out of the slum conditions of London or Manchester and to go to a new town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be some form of safeguard to ensure that consultation takes place on the transfer so that everybody in the new community should be clear as to what is to happen. Otherwise we are leaving the door open to a great deal of ill feeling which none of us wants. This applies particularly to the second generation in the new towns, where a new population is added to the existing one. They are settling down after a period of time, good will is developing, and it would cause considerable bad feeling if dramatic changes were made to previous commitments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful for clarification from the Minister on those points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regarding Amendment 10, while I accept what my hon. Friend said about this, would he undertake to take another look at this issue, that of small parcels of land which are within the developed area? Would he consider the implications of what has been said this morning so that we are sure when this Bill becomes law there are no loopholes of the variety I have described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would start by reassuring my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) that I will do as he asks and make absolutely sure that there will not be any serious difficulty over what he describes as "parcels of land". He has a point, and he deserves reassurance. I will consult about that and see that the Committee has the reply to the question he has put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had three general points put to us by the hon. Gentleman the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris). I will try to answer briefly. We have had a long and interesting debate, some of it not directly concerned with the clause with which we are at the moment concerned. I ought not to prolong the matter, but I will try to deal with the points of substance which have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first was the hon. Gentleman's anxiety to have the word "estate" defined, or to find some better form of definition. Lawyers will tell us there are a number of things that are not defined. "Houses" are not defined; I do not think they are defined in this Bill. "Bricks" are not defined, but, as we are told Lord Attlee said, we know what a brick is when we see one or what an elephant is when we see one. I know what an estate is when I see one. I cannot believe that the arguments that will develop when these consultative meetings take place will be long ones about what is or is not an estate. I would have thought it a simpler job than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to leave a certain flexibility in this clause, simply because there are inevitable differences in the layout and planning of different new towns in various parts of the country. One hopes common sense will prevail in those discussions, and that, as a consequence of that, a reasonable and logical solution to the transfer of assets will be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman rightly reminded me of something I omitted to deal with when I spoke earlier during these proceedings. That is his question about paragraph (	<i>c</i>). He asked whether, for instance, the district council would necessarily have to accept the rent offices. I would have thought the answer to that to be "Yes", in so far as they are defined in that paragraph. It says
	<br><blockquote><p>"any property and rights held by the corporation for the administration of an estate".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
The new town corporation would have little use for a rent office of an estate which it was handing over. I cannot believe there would be any serious doubt about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should mention that this paragraph could cover such things as small depots, or small workshops associated with an estate and serving the estate. That would be the definition which would bring them into a transfer scheme, rather than a workshop which happened to be on an estate but which served a very much wider area, or which was not associated with that estate. Nevertheless, that would be the situation in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have been responsible for the protracted debate we have had by my use of the word "authoritarian". I did not use the word in any pejorative sense. The development corporation is set up to develop, and, alas and alack, the fact is that if the new town development corporation in Stevenage had not been set up there would have been no Stevenage. As the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) has pointed out, the democratic people living in the area, probably the majority of them, were against that development taking place. The development corporations are authoritarian for two reasons. First, because they are charged with the task of development on behalf of the community as a whole. Secondly, for the obvious reason that the only right that individuals have so far as a "new" new town is concerned is the right to decide whether they are going to live in it or not. Many decisions are taken about the planning of a new town before the inhabitants arrive, or, in some cases, even before they are born. That inevitably means that new towns are authoritarian in a perfectly neutral sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill deals with the situation where the development has taken place, where it is finished, or nearly finished. That, to the Government, seems to be the right time for the transfer of assets to take place, in order that the democratic element should play its full part in the shaping of the community once it is developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to enter into the important debate on the issue of consulting tenants. I do not think it arises on this clause. I hope we shall have the oppor-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
tunity to give this some consideration later, either in Committee or on Report, because some important issues have been raised. I would rather not deal with that specific point at this stage of our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that answer. I am slightly disappointed that he is not prepared to define an "estate". Perhaps I might mention my experience in the transfer of properties in London. I was in charge in one of the London boroughs some years ago. It was not all plain sailing. It took a long time to get any measure of agreement. I well remember one rent office on the edge of an estate which was surplus to our requirements. We had no wish to get involved in long negotiations over that property. However, there were long and protracted negotiations, and in the end we did not have to take it over. This sort of thing is not as far fetched as might be suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has reassured us about our fear that this is a sweeping subsection. He has told us that he will be writing to his hon. Friend, and I hope he will send a copy of his letter to other members of the Committee, so that we may be quite clear about these marginal pieces of land. In the light of what is now on the record, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 12, in page 2, line 35, leave out from 'corporation' to the end of line 39 and insert 'specified in Schedule 1'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</ol>
</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aim of the amendments is to define in a schedule to the Bill the nature of the housing-related assets to be transferred. This is an important matter. As a consequence of this we also propose leaving out subsections (4) and (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not completely clear as to the order mentioned in subsection (3)(	<i>g</i>). What is the actual effect of it? Is it an order made once by the Secretary of State, and which then covers all subsequent occasions, unless it is revoked or altered? Does it set out at that time what these particular assets are, or is it an order which is specific to each particular transfer of assets and each particular new town scheme? It really could be, on the face of it, interpreted either way. The paragraph talks about "the corporation" as if it were talking about one particular corporation. I do not quite see why it is that there would be an order defining the assets in the case of each individual corporation—which is what one would assume the word "the" to mean—when there is not an order but merely an administrative direction empowering the transfer to take place. It looks as though it is possible that we have an order defining what can be transferred on each specific occasion, and that then, by purely administrative action, we have the approval of the Secretary of State to that actually happening. Therefore, I hope that in the reply the first thing to be made clear will be what is means by the word " order".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to help on this point by making it clear that paragraph (	<i>g</i>) is, as it were, the flexibility provision in the clause as a whole. It is designed to cover eventualities which may not have been foreseen by legislators as wise as even ourselves. Indeed, my right hon. Friend has earlier had to move Amendment No. 8 in order to cover an eventuality which was not foreseen within the Department until
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
fairly late in the discussions. This only illustrates the difficulty with legislation. There may be some asset in an estate which is not covered by this clause as it stands, unless it includes paragraph (	<i>g</i>), which enables my right hon. Friend to make an order so that some additional asset which might not be included in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>), (	<i>d</i>), and so on, can be transferred. That is the purpose of this paragraph, and I hope the explanation will help the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deduce from that that these orders would be of general application; that it might be found that the other elements in the Bill do not allow a particular transfer to occur, that therefore an order would be made by the Secretary of State and approved by Parliament; and that from then on that order would be, as it were, an addition to the legislation, and would cover all subsequent examples of transfer of assets, rather than being related to one particular new town scheme. Have I understood that correctly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order could be general, such as the order which my right hon. Friend might have had to make, but will now, I hope, not have to make because we have approved Amendment No. 8 this morning. Or indeed, it could be particular, in that there may be some exceptional circumstance on a particular estate or in a particular new town which required an order specific to that new town or even to a particular estate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation, but it seems a bit odd that there would be an order saying that such and such is to be an asset, and that that would have to be brought before Parliament for approval, when the actual scheme of which the order is only one ingredient does not have to come before Parliament for approval but can be made by authoritarian ministerial action of the kind with which we are familiar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: By legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The essence of what we are putting forward is that we do not see why the Bill should not define the housing-related assets as opposed to the housing itself. There has been considerable discussion about these housing-related
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
assets—notably in the Stevenage consultative document—and what we are putting forward is based on the belief that it is invariably better, if it is possible, to put into a Bill itself the actual details, rather than having them left vaguely, as they are in the Bill as now drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Second Reading debate the right hon. Gentleman said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the assets to be transferred are essentially those planned and provided from place to place and from time to time for the use of occupiers or other inhabitants of the dwellings. They should not include assets planned and provided for the use of the inhabitants of the town as a whole. The Bill does not attempt to lay down hard and fast rules about this. It is generally something which is best worked out locally with local knowledge. We shall, of course, give further administrative advice to ensure that we are not bogged down in theological disputes whether this shopping centre, or that open space, or any other individual site should be associated with the dwelling transferred. Although the Secretary of State retains a discretion under the Bill to modify transfer schemes, I am sure that common sense will prevail and the need to exercise the discretion will rarely if ever be invoked."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 23rd March 1976; Vol. 908, c. 216.]</p></blockquote>
That was quite a clear statement of the Minister's point of view. I question whether this point of view is necessarily right, and whether it is not possible to set out rather more specifically what these housing-related assets might be. We should like to have rather more firmly the Minister's reasons for believing that it is not possible to specify them. Our inclination is to believe that they should be specified, and that is the force of our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report of the working party dealing with the transfer of rented houses in new towns produced a practical list of housing-related assets. They were summarised in annex A to that document, and the Minister will recognise that we have based our schedule on them. Obviously, the list in the schedule is not necessarily comprehensive. If the Minister tells us that we have left out important ingredients, we shall understand. We hope that the Minister will accept the principle of the schedule as being a desirable ingredient in the Bill. If it is felt that the schedule could be composed in some other way, and that there are items which should be put into it or left out of it, we would listen with sympathy to what he has to say; but we believe that in principle it is right that all this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
should be spelt out quite clearly, and that is the purpose of our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the properties which we suggest should be treated as associated with transferred dwellings, the first we have listed is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Open space associated with an area of rented housing."</p></blockquote>
We are thinking about things that are integral parts of the layout. In any housing estate, whatever we may or may not mean by housing estate, if we apply Lord Attlee's "elephant" test, it is possible to see that there are open spaces which are an integral part of the housing estate, and clearly designed for people to play in and for old people to sit in. Although we may sometimes have difficulties which have to be resolved by other means it is not a difficult statutory concept to put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to be inherent in the planning of new towns that they go for a rather conscious estate feeling. I do not respond to this concept. I prefer something more accidental. I appreciate that we cannot have complete accidents, because the project is looked at in one go, but I feel that the new towns tend to be too "estatey" in their style. There could quite clearly be open spaces which are directly associated with housing, and it seems to me, therefore, a perfectly practical proposition that this should be one of the housing-related assets which should be defined in our schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second item in the list is
	<br><blockquote><p>"Play spaces associated with rented housing."</p></blockquote>
This seems to fall under the same description. The playground may be immediately beside the housing, and there is no difficulty about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next we have "T.V. relay systems". I do not know much about this subject. I am told that it is a thing of the future. Most things of the future seem to take a long time to arrive, and I suspect that this may be the case here, but I understand that a television relay system is something which, for practical reasons, can be connected to a particular housing scheme, and for that reason we have included it in the list in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next one is "Meeting halls", and I can imagine that at times this would pose a little more difficulty. Meeting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
halls, I suppose, will tend to relate to, perhaps, a wider area than the other things I have talked about, and, obviously, we may need to define exactly what is the catchment area for the meeting hall. We are talking here about meeting halls which are clearly designed to serve a particular estate or estates being transferred, and in that sense housing-related.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next category is "Local shops, corner shops". There was some discussion earlier this morning about shops, and I do not feel wholly persuaded that the neighbourhood shop is really housing-related in this sense. By "neighbourhood" I imply a topographical area rather than the looser terminology. We are talking of the small shopping parade and the corner shop, which may even be built into the physical structure of a block of flats or, more likely, a row of terraced houses. I do not think there will be any dispute that the strictly corner shop is very much a housing-related asset of its kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same thing applies to the next category, public houses. If they are free standing, there is a case for selling the freehold, though I will not pursue that point now. If they are part of a row of houses, part of the basic housing structure of the place, there is a case for arguing that they are housing-related assets. The Stevenage report had some reservations on this matter. In the body of the report it is suggested that public houses were not housing-related assets because they served a wider area, but in the conclusions, they are slipped into annex I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Stevenage report also discussed surgeries, our next category, and said that, generally, they seemed to be related to the catchment areas. The report discussed whether vets' surgeries should be treated in the same way and concluded that although they probably covered a wider catchment area because there are not so many vets as doctors, they should be included with other surgeries. We do not have a firm view on this matter, but we think doctors' surgeries are a housing-related asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our eighth category which is land
	<br><blockquote><p>"infill sites in areas of rented housing"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
does not contain housing at present, but is likely to have houses built on it in the near future, and so is obviously directly linked to housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our next category includes depots specifically serving housing, rather than those which cover a whole area. There is a problem in that depots run by new town corporations or local authorities are often likely to have both housing and general purpose functions. It would not be appropriate to include some depots, but where they are directed solely to housing needs we would regard them as genuine housing-related assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same is true of our next category
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nurseries for landscape maintenance".</p></blockquote>
Landscaping, of course, also has to do with shops and general environment, but it is not unreasonable to include nurseries as primarily a housing-related asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our last category covers local housing offices. Again, these may combine other functions, but where they are concerned with housing management related to the housing being transferred, it seems sensible they should be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes sense to us that this list of housing related assets should be clearly spelled out in the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not discuss, when I referred to shops, a question of some significance—the relationship between a flat over a shop and the shop itself. That arouses controversy in a different field—the private rented market—but it is a matter to be looked at, and the Stevenage report makes the common-sense point that a flat over a shop should normally go with the shop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe our Schedule contains a great deal of common sense, and I shall be interested to hear whether the Government can make a serious argument against it. I hope we shall have a sympathetic response to our very strong case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) for explaining his amendments. Before responding, I wish to correct something I said in an intervention. I was wrong to suggest that an order could be particular in its application. It would be general in its application if it were made by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
I reiterate what I said in an intervention, which was correct, and which must be underlined because it forms a large part of the answer to the hon. Member's speech. Paragraph (	<i>g</i>) is a flexibility provision and a long stop device to cover assets which may be transferred from the corporation to a district council, but which have not been foreseen in this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>f</i>) cover all the eventualities listed in the Schedule. Open space associated with an area of rented housing is covered in paragraph (	<i>b</i>). Play spaces are covered, and so, too, are local shops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I got the impression that the hon. Member for Aylesbury was moving the amendments under a misunderstanding of the purport of the order. It is designed to cover any eventualities which might be omitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my hon. Friends suggested one or two possibilities and the hon. Member for Aylesbury referred to surgeries. It is a danger that with a Schedule listing serving an estate, they should be transferred to a district council, but suppose, for the sake of argument, there was no surgery, but there was a health centre. That might cause some arguments. There is a danger that with a Schedule listing things which rightly ought to be transferred that there may be other things of which we have not yet thought. That is why I prefer our drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there are such other things subsequently, no doubt it would be possible to do as the Minister is proposing and set up an order-making power. We believe that, at the start, it is better to try to define these things rather than to cloak them in the slightly vaguer language of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of opinion, but if the hon. Member thinks it ought to be done by order it is odd that in his Amendment No. 12 he seeks to exclude the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel the best way to proceed is by a serioes of provisions covering the properties which will need to be transferred, to include a long-stop provision, which will be used on the very rare occasion of an unforeseen eventuality and to give the Secretary of State power to make an order where necessary so that assets
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
which ought to be transferred may be transferred without difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Opposition's feeling that there should be a list, but they and local councillors may not have realised that the clause covers all eventualities. I believe the list in the new schedule has been copied from the Stevenage working party report, and I think we have learned in the Committee that it is dangerous to move such things straight into the Bill because properties which should be transferred are likely to be excluded. It is much better for advisory material to be made available to those involved in transfers where lists and the rest can be provided in order to explain the legislation to district councils and new town corporations. It is better to give guidance rather than to attempt to state the situation in legal language which can give rise to difficulties when unforeseen eventualities arise in a transfer scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the Government cannot accept the amendments and why we would prefer to leave the situation as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is very persuasive, but we are right to try to get a little more definition in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says it is not right that the schedule should be lifted from the working party report into the Bill, but we have all read the report in some depth, and the main purpose of having a working party of this sort is surely to have experts—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not Bill makers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that point. Members of the working party said they were not legislators. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At Annex A we have listed types of property which it might be claimed are 'closely associated' with housing. We do not suggest this list is exhaustive"—</p></blockquote>
neither did my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"but we hope that any type of property not specifically covered could be dealt with by analagy with some type or types of property in the list."</p></blockquote>
That is a very practical approach—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
