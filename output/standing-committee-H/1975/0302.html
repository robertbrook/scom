	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>FAIR EMPLOYMENT (NORTHERN IRELAND) BILL [LORDS]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move:
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Airey Neave</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would seem to us that considerable hardship would follow this arrangement. Tomorrow Ministers have to attend another Northern Ireland Committee. This means that they will attend Committees three days a week. Moreover, we must bear in mind the constitutency duties of the Northern Ireland Members who are present, apart from those of my colleagues. The Northern Ireland Committee to which I am referring is the so-called "Grand Committee." It will meet tomorrow and will almost certainly spill over to next Wednesday. It is our wish that at least for the next fortnight today's Committee should not sit more than one day a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate, as the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) has said, that there are problems for us all and not least for Ministers. I shall be leaving here this afternoon to go back to Northern Ireland. I shall return tomorrow night ready for Committee on Thursday. I shall go back to Northern Ireland on Thursday afternoon to carry out duties over the week-end. That is the way life is at present. The Government want to give adequate time to discuss the Bill. We feel that it is normal for a Committee to meet on Tuesday and Thursday morning. I realise that problems exist but they are problems with which we have to live in the Northern Ireland context. I ask the Committee to accept the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow up what has been said by the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave). I accept that two mornings a week is still the normal quantum for Standing Committees—at least I hope it is. On the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
other hand, at any rate during the initial stages of the Bill, there are reasons why we should sit less frequently. One of those reasons has been mentioned by the hon. Member for Abingdon. It so happens that the Northern Ireland Committee is due to sit tomorrow and it is the understanding that that sitting will be continued on the following Wednesday. That means, if we are to accept this Motion, that Northern Ireland Members will be sitting continuously on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week and next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also accept, as the Minister has said, that the duties of Northern Ireland Ministers are certainly no less onerous than those of Northern Ireland Back Benchers. I am sure that there was no implication to the contrary in what was said by the hon. Member for Abingdon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a special consideration which arises in relation to the Bill. When the Bill was read a Second time a fortnight ago there was a considerable difference of opinion as to the views held in Northern Ireland upon the principle, let alone the details, of the Bill. Moreover, although those of us who are concerned with it have already been making considerable efforts—with which my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) and others will be acquainting the Committee later—to ascertain the real lay-out of opinion in Northern Ireland, it would not be true to say that we are yet sufficiently fully informed on that to be sure of conveying to the Committee the balance and nature of the relevant opinion in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adding these two considerations together—the concurrence of the Northern Ireland Committee with the sittings of this Committee during the next two weeks and the fact that in these early stages opinion in Northern Ireland and our contact with it is still gradually coming to concentrate on the Bill—I agree with the hon. Member for Abingdon that it would be better if we amended the Motion. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is proposing to move an amendment to the Motion, but if we did sit for one day a week, at any rate for the first week or two, we could, on a further motion from the Minister, reconsider progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be in the mind of my hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0010">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) to propose an amendment in some such terms as those which have just been mentioned by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell). There is no need for me to add more than a sentence or so to the cogent arguments put forward by the right hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a Bill of fundamental controversy, at least between the Government and the official Opposition. We have no disposition to be tiresome or dilatory. Indeed, we wish to be constructive and to improve the Bill with as much despatch as is compatible with full discussion. Therefore, I hope that the Minister—Ministers have their duties to attend on both sides of St. George's Channel—will heed the arguments that have been put forward by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the comments of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) in which he urged that the Government should consider the Committee sitting for one day a week, at least for the next two or three weeks because of the pressure of Northern Ireland business, not least the meetings that will take place on the next two Wednesdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman went on to say that there would have to be considerable discussion. He intimated that his hon. Friends had important matters to raise in the Committee. The Government recognise this. However, we also—with</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>That during the proceedings on the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Bill [	<i>Lords</i>] the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>proper discussion—want to see progress made on the Bill. If the right hon. Gentleman is suggesting one day a week—and it is open-ended—we may have to consider at some future date whether there is sufficient time to discuss all the business sitting only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I hope that there will be enough time, but if there is not we shall have to consider longer periods. We do not want to do that.</p>
	<p>I take note of the observations of the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) who has said that although the Opposition want to examine the Bill they do not want in any way to delay its passage. We feel that although it may inconvenience hon. Members and Ministers, we have a duty, perhaps, at times to make sacrifices. We do not think that we are asking people to make sacrifices that we are not making. On that basis I think that we should if at all possible, try to make progress.</p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our fundamental objection to the Bill concerns the setting up of this agency. If it has to he set up we want to do what we can to ensure that it has a possibility of meeting with some success. Moreover, we also want to do what we can to declare what precisely are its responsibilities. If we are to do that we must ensure that it is sufficiently small that there is a sense of discipline and of control. We do not want it to be made so large that it has many individual component parts. We want it to have the good relations which we hope exist on the factory floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment is tabled to ensure that there is a limit on the size of this body. If the Minister can convince us that the figure he is advocating may meet those criteria then we may reconsider the matter. We want to limit the agency's size. We want to ensure that it is controllable and that there can be a sense of discipline within it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In supporting my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) I am in a certain difficulty in that although not technically, they are in practice, by their nature, paving amendments. It will be part of the contention which my hon. Friends and I shall be putting forward that basically the approach to this whole problem by way of the agency is misconceived. That is a matter which can, of course, be dealt with on the close stand part debate. However, as my hon. Friend has said, if the agency is to be set up under the terms of the Bill, we would wish its usefulness to be at a maximum and its potentiality, or rather its temptation to "busy-body" and interfere, to be at the minimum. It is for that reason that we have tabled a number of amendments to the schedule which deals with the detailed proceedings of the agency. However, we here query the necessity for so large a membership of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the right hon. Gentleman replies he will, even at this stage, give some indication of the way in which it is assumed that the agency will operate. I do not believe for a moment that the Government and the parliamentary draftsmen just drew the minimum of five and the maximum of 11 out of a hat. They must have had some notion in their minds as to how the agency would operate so that a lower figure than five or a larger
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
figure than 11 would be inconvenient. I think it fair that we should be told whether the agency in some or all of its activities is expected to run in duplicate or triplicate. We note in the schedule that for some purposes five is to be the quorum of the agency. That reference will be found on page 46 line 13.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not only the matter of the quorum and what should be a minimum quorum, but the whole method of operation which has to be taken into account in deciding what ought to be the right size for a body such as this. Perhaps I might candidly express the fear of my hon. Friends and myself. It is that if the agency has 11 members and a chairman, there will be three or four sub-units of the agency, some of which at any rate will be concerning themselves, to an extent which we regard as potentially harmful, with the contents of Part II of the Bill. We fear that the agency would be busying itself with all sorts of superfluous and potentially damaging investigations and statistical inquiries into firms, whereas a smaller agency than is proposed would be adequate to the practical task which the Bill gives it in policing Part III. We have criticisms of Part II. We question whether, with a different approach to the Bill, it could not have been policed as are other parts of the law by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accepting, however, that the approach in the Bill is by way of agency, we are not convinced that the volume of work which the agency will he undertaking under Part III—which we hope will be the business end of the Bill—will call for more than a maximum of seven and a minimum of three members in addition to the chairman. I hope that the amendments will enable the Minister of State, even at this stage, to give us some insight into Government's thinking about the manner of the working of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think we should be under any misapprehension that when we take leave of this Bill, having installed the agency, that body will be in a position of considerable independence. I am sure that the Minister of State is under no misapprehensions as to the importance of getting the right sort of people as chairman and members of the board, people not merely of weight, but of prudence and tact. However, even on the best
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
assumptions which I am content to make as to the selection which will be made—and we shall be coming presently to the manner of appointing the chairman and members—we shall have launched something which has considerable independence and over which, once it is at work, it will be very difficult and perhaps undesirable, at any rate for a time, for Parliament to exercise surveillance. We are therefore by no means asking irrelevant or minor questions which we invite the Committee to direct its mind to the manner in which this agency will operate and the scale upon which its operations will be conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister of State will take to heart the last point I shall put to him on this numerical issue. We have heard a good deal in recent weeks about the celebrated lists of the great and the good. I do not know whether there is a Northern Ireland list of the great and the good. I am sure that there are great and good in Northern Ireland. I do not know whether they have been compiled into a list in the manner in which such a compilation is rumoured to exist elsewhere at present. You will be aware, Mrs. Jeger, from disclosures in various memoirs which have recently appeared, how Ministers, having launched a Bill of this sort and having placed upon themselves an obligation to set up a body, are reduced to desperation when it comes to staffing it. In this emergency, we read that Ministers turn to, I suppose at present, the head of the Civil Service, who is always ready to fetch the list from a drawer and oblige with helpful suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put a simple point to the Minister of State out of friendship and goodwill to him, and I do it with some recollection of my experience as Minister of Health in having to find fit and proper persons to staff regional hospital boards and other similar bodies when they were only a little larger than the maximum size proposed here for the agency. I remember the sense of desperation and even dismay with which I found myself filled on being presented with a list of potentially suitable great and good members for boards, and feeling that I did not really have that background knowledge of the people who were suggested to me which thoroughly justified the responsibility I was taking in appointing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practical point I offer the Minister is that the fewer persons he has to appoint
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the easier it will be for him to be fairly certain that he is appointing the right people—that he is appointing the people whom he knows thoroughly and whom he and his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State are justified in feeling will do good and not harm, who will be wise as well as active, prudent as well as inquisitive. In this way when he has set up the agency as whole the right hon. Gentleman may be satisfied that it is working well in accordance with the best hopes of those who supported the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interest not merely of the working of the Bill but of the discharge of the Secretary of State's functions under it, and in an entirely helpful sense, I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Parkinson's Law is as likely to apply to the Fair Employment Agency in Northern Ireland as to any other public body. There has been a good deal of caustic public comment in the United Kingdom on the race relations industry and on the sex discrimination industry which is now deevloping. We do not want a fair employment industry to arise in Northern Ireland to make good the depression in industry proper. There seems much to be said for a simple structure for the agency. It is likely to be more efficient if it is not overmanned or overwomanned. We agree with the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) that the Secretary of State—or is it the head of Department of Manpower Services—would like quality rather than quantity. There is not all that much talent going spare at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the point of public expenditure. Yesterday on the Floor of the House the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland made it quite clear that he had no funds on his Vote to throw about. So, while we are not wedded to this group of amendments, we see the force of the argument which has been put forward by the right hon. Member for Down, South and we shall listen very attentively to the Minister of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert J. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if the Minister of State endeavours to justify the numbers provided in the Bill, we will argue that there should be a large reduction in the functions of the agency. Therefore we will argue that the numbers in the Bill are much too high. I am very worried about the cost of such a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
large and possibly unwisely agency. I lave had the experience of finding people already lining up for jobs on the agency. We have enough non-productive workers, agencies and boards in Northern Ireland. We do not want to add another by way of this agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to follow some of the arguments advanced by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), but that would, perhaps, take is on to the wider context of the operation)f the agency. As he rightly says, the question of appointments is dealt with at a later stage in the Bill. The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) said he hoped that the Government would justify the numbers proposed. We are not playing the numbers game. I am sure that the amendment seeks to elicit from the Government our reasons for proposing the numbers in the Bill. That is a very valid question. I have looked at the matter in some detail. The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) linked his argument about a reduction in the numbers with the reduction he would like to see in the agency's functions. I must, however, deal with the question of numbers on the basis of the level of functions as the Government see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency will have a considerable amount of work to do, including interventionist work, which we shall debate in some detail a little later. I agree with the right hon. Member for Down, South that the agency will he a powerful body in Northern Ireland, that it will be dealing with a very delicate and contentious issue. As to the cost, the people of the United Kingdom would certainly say that if there was a means of lessening the sectarian tension in Northern Ireland the cost would be very cheap to the British taxpayer. They see as the parallel the amount of money the British taxpayer has to pay to deal with the problems in Northern Ireland. I do not say that the Bill will eradicate those problems, but it will make an important contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agency must he properly balanced between the two communities. It must be representative of both sides of industry. It must reflect the whole range of society in Northern Ireland on a proper basis. It will need legal expertise, and its range of abilities and tasks will be such as to justify a membership of 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The right hon. Member for Down, South spoke about the lists of selections and committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of time and trouble goes into appointments and we want to make sure that we get the right people. I have been in this job exactly two years on Saturday and in those two years I have come to know a lot of people in all strata of society in Northern Ireland. On the basis of the 1.6 million people about whom we are talking I find that the representation we are able to put on many committees in Northern Ireland reflects very well the community, which is extremely well represented on a number of committees of trade unions, employers and on boards and on many other organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have the benefit of advice from responsible organisations in Northern Ireland who, we know, will put forward their own points of view and other considerations. The final decision will be a Minister's decision and he will have to take responsibilty for the appointments. We do not feel that it will be an insurmountable problem and we feel that there are sufficient people of the right calibre to man this agency. We need the numbers laid down in the Bill because we need scope and breadth of representation. I should like to see direct worker representation as well as employers and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the sorts of consideration the Government have in mind and I therefore urge the Committee to support the Government on the numbers we are seeking, a maximum of eleven with an operational factor of five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) was honest and made his position clear when he said that he and his colleagues objected to the whole content of the Bill. In that position it would be logical for them to take whatever action they can to make the Bill as ineffective as possible. That was the role played by the hon. Member this morning. He tried to create the idea that this might become an industry in Northern Ireland. He suggested that people would be appointed by favour of the Minister or for some other consideration and that thereby there would be too many people on the agency which would render it less effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
This Bill has the support of responsible people in Northern Ireland particularly the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. That means that it has the support of representatives of the whole trade union movement in Northern Ireland, people of varying political persuasions and of different ideologies and religions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have been very generous but I must call the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that we are dealing with numbers here and although tangential references to appointments are inevitable they must be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been an attempt to restrict the numbers to three but I fully support the Minister when he says that before appointments are made to the agency discussions will have to take place between representative bodies from industry, the trade union movement and other organisations. This legislation is of major importance in Northern Ireland and representation on the agency cannot be restricted to a small section of the community. Three, four or five would not be suitable figures in this case. This proposal has the support of Opposition Members who have been made aware of the problems in Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Van Straubenzee) was instrumental in finding the extent of the problem and is to be congratulated on bringing his report into the daylight and giving the support he has up to to now. I support the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear from the Minster's reply that the Committee has not wasted its time so early in looking at the proposed size of the agency. The Minister helped the Committee by indicating at any rate the area in which the Government had been thinking when they arrived at their proposed size for the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, before I address myself to that, I might make a brief reference to what the Minister of State said about the cost of lessening tension. I fear that this will not be the first time that we shall differ in this Committee, but not about the object. We shall be differing sharply and even fundamentally about method. There is no difference between the two sides as to the desirability of what the Minister called lessening tension or the willingness to pay what might be the cost
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
of doing so. We on this side of the Committee are afraid that what is being adopted might be unproductive and even counter-productive. It was in that sense that my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) was referring to the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I come to the disclosure by the Minister of State of the basic thinking of the Government. I was evidently mistaken in my conjecture that they arrived at figures of five and eleven for the Committee by consideration of its mode of working. It appears from what the Minister of State said that it was a sort of compilation arrived at by adding together various elements which might have to be accommodated within the Committee—rather as in the old days, when we had to have a "statutory" woman on these boards. Therefore account was taken of a "statutory" woman in providing for the minimum and maximum size of such a body. It is that the minimum and maximum have been suggested in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister of State was referring to balance I do not think our anxieties were particularly aroused, because obviously on any body of this sort there are various elements and representative capaciies—I do not use the word representative in the technical sense, but in the general sense—which have to be taken into account. We must say that since this is a body which will perform primarily judicial functions—again in the widest sense of the term "judicial"—and which will have to secure confidence in its impartiality, wisdom, and depth of view, we hope that the right hon. Gentleman will have regard to the judicial qualifications—not using the term in the narrow sense but in the sense of quality of judgment—of the persons he appoints rather than to their background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State was more specific and referred to a balance of representation of the two communities. In saying that, I think he has brought us straight into consideration of some of the difficulties and dangers of the Bill. I hope I shall be in order—since this is the reason for the figures the Minister of State has in the Bill—in making some inquiry as to what is meant by the representation in the membership of the agency of the two communities. Does it mean there is to be a quota system? In talking of the size of the agency the Minister of State
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
has said that we must have one of a certain size to secure proper representation of the two communities. One cannot refrain from asking what, in this context, is proper representation of the two communities? This is not a quibble, but goes to the heart of the one central issue which will confront us. Does it mean proportionate representation, two to one, or even representation on the basis that it is equality of opportunity which is to be the guiding objective of the agency?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can understand if the Minister is unwilling, as I should be in his place, to respond to an invitation to say whether there are to be two-thirds non-Roman Catholic and one-third Roman Catholic or whether it is some other proportion which he has in mind. But he cannot escape so easily from giving a more precise answer because if the agency was restricted to the size proposed by my hon. Friend there would not be the slightest difficulty in ensuring that there was at least one and maybe several Roman Catholics among those regarded as suitable on other qualifications—or one non-Roman Catholic, or one athiest regarded on other grounds as being suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State will confirm that although major appointments to the Bench in Northern Ireland are not made with any consideration of representation of what he calls the two communities, some of the most distinguished members of the Bench at this time, and some of the most respected, belong to the minority community. It is not enough for him to say that he takes it for granted that some members of the agency, of necessity, will be Roman Catholics. There would not be any dispute about that but he says "I have to have a larger agency than is wanted by the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. McCusker) to secure proper representation of the two communities".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Committee can leave it there because the Minister cannot have left it there in his lucubrations on the matter. He says, that he has been doing his homework carefully and he must have discovered, that within the figure of seven people he could not provide what he regarded as a proper representation of all the respective religious elements in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This first debate in the Committee has already strengthened some of the apprehensions felt by my hon. Friends and
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
myself that, inexorably, and against the intentions of every hon. Member, this Bill will carry us into a quota system even more precise, and a quota system which it will be impossibe sooner or later to avoid disclosing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One final thing arises directly out of the Minister's argument. I have said that perhaps a guiding factor in the size selected for the agency was the expectation that, like excursion trains, this would need to run in several parts. The Minister would not dispute that. The schedule envisages precisely that some such excursion basis will be adopted by the agency. Let me put this question to the Minster of State. Is there also to be his requisite balance of representation on all subcommittees and subdivisions through which the agency does its work? Will the right hon. Gentleman provide for whatever is his quota for each of these sub-divisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unawares or not, by his reply to this first amendment the right hon. Gentleman has disclosed something of the jungle of difficulties into which we are being led by the structure and concept of this Bill. Certainly the Committee is indebted to the right hon. Gentleman—though I do not think it will help him in the long run—for the revelation—and we hope there will be more to come—that he has made on the thinking behind the figures which he selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point of the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) and indeed of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) that the agency needs to be broadly representative, but that the numbers to be decided on for the agency should perhaps depend to some extent on how far the agency would be able to draw on the services and advice of other bodies working in the same or similar fields. The Minister of State, who is very familiar with these matters, will know that in June 1971 a Review Body was set up by the then Ministry of Health and Social Services, representative of the CBI in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to assist in carrying out a comprehensive review of industrial relations. The review body reported and unanimously proposed the establishment of an entirely new and independent labour relations agency. That agency would have among its duties that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
of tackling problems that have proved inacapable of solution through existing machinery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that there is an overlap here and that this labour relations agency if it comes into being could be helpful in the area which is the subject of this Bill. I wonder whether at some appropriate stage in the discussion of this Bill the Minister of State would tell us how he sees the relationship of the Fair Employment Agency and the proposed labour relations agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his usual energy and enthusiasm, the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) has endeavoured to interpret the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) in relation to the opposition to the Bill. It is important not to confuse what my hon. Friend said. It is important not to confuse opposition to details in the Bill with opposition to the principle underlying the Bill. We shall seek to make that point very clear as this Committee pro-proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point is that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) said, we are not averse to paying our contribution to maintaining peace, law and order in Northern Ireland, but I think the Minister of State must be made aware that we are most reluctant to pay the bill for a process which will heighten the awareness of religious division in Northern Ireland and will heighten a mistaken demand for so-called justice within industry when no such conflicting emotions need arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very pleased that we tabled this amendment because, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) has said, they have exposed the dangers inherent in the Bill. The Minister has failed signally to answer the question which I might not otherwise have been able to put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the justifications the right hon. Gentleman gave was that this agency had to have powerful interventionist activities. It is precisely those activities which are feared by industrialists and trade unionists in Northern Ireland. That is why we are trying to reduce the numbers in this agency. Whilst the agency is acceptable and may have some role to play, we want it to be a clearly defined role which will
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
enable it to achieve something. We do not see any part of this role being powerful interventionist work which will involve going into companies and investigating the religious position there. We should not dodge this issue. Roman Catholics and Protestants will be numbered, labelled and counted and it will be argued whether there is the right proportion and so on. The inherent danger in this Bill lies in the interventionist role of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also touched on the issue of the quota system. Whatever the Minister might have said in his reply, what came out loudly and clearly was not that the members of this agency will be the best people to do the job—whether it is the job as we see it or the job as he sees it—but that they must in some way represent the two religious communities in Northern Ireland. We see that as the principal danger in the Bill. The Minister has now put it to us in clear terms which we can understand and which the people in industry in Northern Ireland will understand. As I shall show later, they are already beginning to comprehend what it will mean. This will strengthen their view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman did not try in any way to give us any other information about the agency. Will the members of the agency be people with a background of detailed experience in industry? Does he really believe that there is room in the agency for people from any other walk of life in Northern Ireland? Does he believe that someone from outside industry could go into the agency and make a contribution on matters of manpower policy, selection, recruitment and tell industrialists what they know best? He might bear in mind when the training boards were set up in Northern Ireland we had the strange situation that one of the most influential and powerful figures appointed to one of them was a man whose own company had collapsed a few months previously. I well remember the big company I was working for at the time asking "How on earth are we to listen to this man who has been a disastrous failure when he comes along to prattle to us about how we can improve our training methods?" It is important that the right hon. Gentleman considers the composition of the agency and its effect on industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had a very interesting letter from one of the Churches in Northern Ireland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Order. I hope the interesting letter refers to the members, which are the subject of this discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mrs. Jeger. This Church wondered why in the original investigation into religious discrimination the Minister had not included members of religious orders. It felt that when religious discrimination was being considered the Churches should have been represented. Does the Minister believe that the agency should have Church representation? Perhaps we should have a chaplain to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer these questions. He says that he sees powerful interventionist activities, that there will he a quota which represents the religious division, but he has said nothing about qualifications or the restrictions there might be on people who could be members. Quite apart from that, we are concerned about numbers. If there are 12 members, will they have 12 secretaries, multiples of 12 research agents, multiples of 12 field officers, and so on? So that we may make progress, I hope that the Minister will he prepared to give us a little more information about the precise nature and composition of the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies may I say that it would be going a little wide if he went into a clause stand part dissertation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly endeavour to abide by your ruling, Mrs. Jeger, but wide points were raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) who thinks that he has obtained information from me and the Government that was not given before, I have to say that is a naive suggestion. He knows, and the Committee knows, that the Government's intention in Northern Ireland is to create an agency which is representative of that society. We should be extremely naive not to recognise the divisions that exist. It is to overcome those divisions that this agency is being created. When he asked about quotas the right hon. Gentleman mentioned, for instance, the "statutory Roman Catholic". One might mention the "statutory Protestants". The answer
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
is that we do not want quotas, we do not want statutory representation. What we want is representation which reflects the society, both industrially and in its divided context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the right hon. Gentleman not agree that when he is drawing up a list of names to be considered for this agency one question he will ask each time is: Is this man a Protestant or a Catholic? To achieve his objective he must ensure that he has members of each religious community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When, as happens very often, I have to make appointments in Northern Ireland my first criterion is that I get the best people to do the job. It is interesting that I receive representations from the right hon. Gentleman and from other people in Northern Ireland, in both communities, insisting that these organisations be representative. What about the fuss that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary faced when he appointed somebody who came from the minority community?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we look at the van Straubenzee report, paragraph 137, we see that the recommendation was for between six and 12 members, which would adequately reflect industry and all its attendant problems. Surely everybody in this Committee would like the position to be such that we did not have to consider the point of the divided community. If we did not have a divided community we should not be sitting here with this Bill in front of us. That is the point and, if I cleared the air and the right hon. Gentleman feels more satisfied, so much the better. Everybody in the Committee knows that we are about a very serious job. The reason for asking for an agency of between five and eleven members is that we feel it will be representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the questions which the hon. Members for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) and Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) asked about the multiplication of jobs, and so on, were not worthy of them. They understand that we are about very serious business here, that we want the agency to be as small as is practicable so that it can operate on a basis that will not be excessively costly. Nevertheless I make the point that if it does cost money and it is effective it is in the interests of the communities in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister of State's last remarks most helpful. The Conservative Party has never wished to obstruct this Bill in any way. We have tried to see that the implementation of the principles of the Bill is improved, and we shall certainly take part in the discussion of various amendments to see that this is done so far as possible. While I had some hesitation, when this amendment was first moved, about the size of the agency and the possibility of its becoming bureaucratic, I am bound to say that in view of this debate and the need to find the best possible people, we would be prepared to support the right hon. Gentleman in what he has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of what we and industry in Northern Ireland have heard this morning, which will heighten our awareness of what this Bill means and strengthen our resolve, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 10, leave out from first "the" to "shall" in line 12 and insert "Secretary of State".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall discuss Amendment No. 16, in page 3, line 29, leave out from first "the" to "shall" in line 30 and insert "Secretary of State".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am under a misapprehension, but Schedule 1, paragraph 14—and I assure you, Mrs. Jeger, that this is relevant to the point I am making—states that during the interim period the agency is to report to the head of the Department but that during the interim period it is the Secretary of State who is to receive the report. I take it from that that the words "head of Department" mean the member of the Executive under the defunct 1973 Act, under which we are, and shall perhaps for some considerable time be, living—the interim period; and we shall irresistibly be reminded of the French proverb, "	<i>Rien ne dure que le proviso ire.</i>"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. W. Stallard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hardly recognised it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government Whip and I take the same position on this question of membership of the European Community, and we are not such barbarians—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman would help the Committee if he were to give a translation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, Mrs. Jeger. My understanding of the French proverb is that it means only that which is provisional proves to be permanent. Having said that, I appear now to have upset the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt), which was the last thing I intended in offering the most literal translation possible. I return to the difficult waters of the relationship between the head of the Department when we are in the interim period and the Secretary of State when we are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I have apprehended the lay-out of paragraph 14 of the first Schedule correctly, I have to ask the right hon. Gentleman why in Clause 1 are we not in the interim period at all? Although in Clause 1 we have provided for the interim period, under Schedule 1 we are living permanently in those far-off, unhappy days of the "Heath Robinson Constitution", with a head of Department of Manpower Services for Northern Ireland. I have no objection at all, since the 1973 Act is on the Statute Book, to the Bill providing at this stage for the contingency, theoretically conceivable, that some Government might be so ill-advised as to attempt to reactivate the 1973 Act. But I am equally sure that the right hon. Gentleman will accept that he must legislate also for the interim period; and the simple point I am putting is: surely, above all else—interim period or no interim period as far as I am concerned, but certainly in the interim period—the Secretary of State himself ought to be the person responsible for the direction and appointment of the members of the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, in the course of the last debate the right hon. Gentleman was, very properly, talking about considerations which he and his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will have in mind. I do not think any member of the Committee would wish that decision to be in the hands of anybody but the Secretary of State responsible to this House. If this agency is to be set up, it ought to be set
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0019">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
up on the responsibility of nobody but the Secretary of State. I hope, therefore, that the right hon. Gentleman will at any rate be able to write into the Bill that for the duration of the interim period the Secretary of State is the person who will appoint the agency, and be responsible thereby, in a sense, for everything which happens under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The analysis which the right hon. Gentleman has given and his reference to the 1973 Act are quite correct. That would be under a form of devolved government which could revert hack, as it were, to the 1973 Act. I am advised that in Clause 1 we do not have to say anything about the interim period, because the Northern Ireland Act 1974 does it for us. It provides that during the interim period anything done by the head of the Department is done by the Department under the direction of the Secretary of State; so in effect we arrive at the same position. I hope that clarifies the point for the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to take up the Committee's time if the matter is purely technical, but I am in some little difficulty. The right hon. Gentleman has not made clear to me why, if the 1974 Act renders such reference unnecessary in Clause 1, it does not render it unnecessary in Schedule 1(14). It may be that that reference in paragraph 14 is unnecessary subtle in dealing with a function that is being done by somebody else and which is not in question, namely, the delivery of the Report. But I am not convinced by that, because paragraph 14(3) of Schedule 1 states that the head of the Department shall lay the annual report, when he gets it, before the Northern Ireland Assembly. I find it impossible to credit that the potency of the excellent Act introduced in 1974 by the present Administration, so superior to the chaos left behind by their political predecessors, is incapable of doing the same thing in Schedule 1. The right hon. Gentleman may say that it was an addition to Clause 1 and Schedule 1—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps I should not have seen that signal, but I gather from diverse signs and portents that that conjecture was unfounded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that there is some consanguinity between the drafting of Schedule
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
1 and Clause 1 of the Bill. Of course, the Committee will accept that by virtue of the 1974 Act—and this is legislation by reference with a vengeance—when we leave the reference to the head of Department of the Northern Ireland Manpower service it means nothing other than our old friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. But surely the right hon. Gentleman will accept that since he has managed to find a little nook or cranny in Schedule 1 where his right hon. Friend can actually be brought into the terminology of the Bill, Clause 1 is surely the place, at the head and fount of the Bill where in the interim period the Secretary of State should appear bold and brazen to all the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman, therefore. I know from experience the difficulties Ministers have with their masters the parliamentary draftsmen, and how often when a Minister asks "Why cannot we say in the Bill what we mean?", this is treated as worse than a child's interruption of a conversation. The Minister is told "It is perfectly all right, because when the lawyers get hold of the Bill they will look up a certain section of some other Act, which will refer them to another Act, so they will not be misled at all." Then the Minister comes back—as I am sure he will in this case—and says " I am presenting a Bill in the House of Commons and I have a Standing Committee H which will examine it. I want the Bill to say what it is actually going to mean in practice in the next two or three years."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to encourage the right hon. Gentleman and give him all the moral force of the Committee in his next joust with his parliamentary advisers. I want him to tell the Committee this morning that while no harm will be done by the present wording and that it will all be reinterpreted in the light of the 1974 Act, nevertheless it would make better sense to all who read the Bill, and not only lawyers, if there were some reference to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in Clause 1, and that therefore he will see whether or not, before the next stage, he will try to get a reference to his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland into Clause 1 of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister of State clear up a point which arose on something said on the Floor of the House

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
from the Opposition Bench? Does "head of Department" in this Bill mean a civil servant or a Minister of the Northern Ireland Office charged under the arrangements of the Secretary of State with responsibility for that particular Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point, which concerns me quite considerably. I have looked at the terminology of "head of Department". The answer I gave in the House was quite correct. It means the political head of the Department. In other words, the final decision rests with the Minister concerned, however he might be appointed, or operating under the 1974 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Statutory Instruments Committee, when it was first dealing with Northern Ireland, questioned why United Kingdom Instruments were usually signed by the political head. In Northern Ireland they seem usually to be signed by Civil Service representatives, which would seem to be consistent with the drafting of the Bill. I ask my right hon. Friend whether he is absolutely certain that this can be a construed only as referring to the political head and, therefore, is not a precedent for a head of a Civil Service producing orders though not responsible to an elected Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my hon. Friend's point. I cannot go into details of the Statutory Instruments Committee, but whether a civil servant lays the Instrument or not, that would be done under the instructions of the Minister concerned, and the civil servant would not be in a position to do it himself, as the head of Department, without the political instrution of the Minister concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to the point made by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) and the warmth with which he embraced me and wished to assist me in any assault that might be needed in the future, I do not know what it did to my hon. Friends but it made me very wary that I might be being lured into a trap by the right hon. Gentleman. I appreciate that he and I have an understanding of these matters, but unfortunately not all others have, and I shall have to be very wary. He has built a very strong case with his usual lucidity and has not only analysed but diagnosed an
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
important point; but it is purely technical. The reason for the wording is that under the 1974 Act we have to deal with the laying of reports. Because of the way that Act was drafted, we have now to say that the report is to be laid before Parliament, because that aspect is not dealt with in the 1974 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of detaining the Committee on this issue. I am sure the Committee is obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for his explanation of the different form of the drafting in Schedule 1 and Clause 1.

11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering this clause in a significant week. I do not think that any hon. Members are under any misapprehension that it will be during the interim period that the agency will start and carry out a good deal of its work. Although the right hon. Gentleman did not respond explicitly to my invitation, I hope that he will consider whether, for purposes of public presentation, it would not be advantageous if he could bring the Secretary of State—I make this point seriously—into the forefront of the discussions on the Bill. I tell him that subject to the selection of the Chair, my hon. Friends and I will provide an opportunity at the next stage for an answer to be given to that plea. Therefore, to save further time, I beg to ask leave to with-draw—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the right hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment may I point out that I shall certainly look at the matter and consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 4, in page 1, line 12, leave out from "which" to "shall" in line 3 on page 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss Amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 3, at end insert "duty of performing the".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would render the reading of this part of the clause as follows:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"consisting of a chairman and at least five but not more than eleven other members all appointed by the head of the Department of Manpower Services for Northern Ireland ("the Department"), which shall have the duty of performing the functions conferred on it by this Act."</p></blockquote>
I should like to make two points. First I take up the point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell). There is, indeed, a great desire and need for simplicity in the drafting of such a Bill as this. We find that in this Bill there is evidence of conflicting processes. In other words, employers are being asked to embark on conflicting adventures to obtain this mystical equality of employment and opportunity. It is important that we reduce the obscurity of the Bill. I believe that by using the wording of these two amendments we would go a long way towards achieving that simplicity and removing certain obscurities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, throughout the Bill there is a degree of repetition which is quite alarming. Indeed, there is a paramount example of this repetition which reflects what I believe to be an intrinsic attempt to expand a Bill and which could be reduced both in composition and in application. However, we fear that if this reduction in wording and verbiage were to take place the Bill would be recognised for what it is—the wrong way of achieving the objectives of the Bill with which Ulster Unionist Members agree. I plead for simplicity and lack of repetition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) has founded his argument for reducing the wording of this subsection so that it runs:
	<br><blockquote><p>"which shall have the duty of performing the functions conferred on it by this Act."</p></blockquote>
on the grounds of the superfluity and vagueness of the wording. I believe that it would be difficult for anyone to fault him on that ground. However, I must confess that my own objections to the words, which I join him in wishing to omit, go considerably deeper than that. I do not believe that in considering these amendments the Committee is engaged in improving or slimming the drafting. I believe that a much larger point than that arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in recent years—by "recent" I mean the post-war period—engaged more and more in what might be called
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
programmatic legislation, legislation consisting of Bills which begin with a first cause setting out a total general objective and land the whole of that objective into the lap either of a Minister, such as the unfortunate Minister of Health under the 1946 Act or, in this case, the agency which is to be created. Of course, as one goes on into the Bill one finds that certain machinery is set up for doing certain specific things. Yet, there still remains that programme in its wake with wide wording—almost wide enough to be included in the Declaration of Human Rights—lodged irremovably into Clause 1. In my view we have a prime example in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial words in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) which my hon. Friend seeks to omit are, equality of opportunity "and in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) "discrimination". Those words are given a precise meaning by the consequent parts of the Bill. No doubt we shall be considering later whether that precision can be increased further, but there is no doubt that the plan of the Bill is to define precisely in legal terminology, so that it can be justiciable, what is meant by "equality of opportunity" and "discrimination".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever we may think of the machinery of the Bill, Opposition Members as much as Labour Members are against the denial of equality of opportunity and discrimination as defined in the Bill. However, that is a different matter from setting up this agency and giving it the duties which, in terms, are virtually unlimited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(1) (	<i>b</i>) says, speaks of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"working for the elimination of discrimination".</p></blockquote>
There is hardly any activity which an agency operating under Parkinson's Law could contemplate that could not be brought within the ambit of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"working for the elimination of discrimination".</p></blockquote>
When we come to deal with Part IV we shall be told precisely what is the duty of the agency in matters of discrimination. In my view that is the proper way for legislation to go about setting up this agency, if that is what we are to do. In Part III we are told precisely, what the agency is to do to ascertain the absence or presence of equality of opportunity and what it is to do if it finds such equality deficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Nothing whatever is added to the effectiveness of Part III or Part IV of the Bill by the words which my hon. Friend has proposed to omit. However, one might ask—I do not think any lawyer would ask and I hope no parliamentarian would ask—"If it takes nothing away, why not leave the words in?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As if often, if not always the case, unnecessary words in a statute cause trouble. Unnecessary words are not just neutral. They are potentially harmful. I have no doubt that the agency will have a legal adviser to construe the statute. I am sure that one of the first demands which the agency will make to the right hon. Gentleman's Department will be for a legal adviser. The agency will say that it has read the proceedings in Standing Committee H, and it is greatly disturbed by the number of difficult legal problems thrown up in the course of debate. It will say to the Secretary of State "You cannot really expect us to set up in business if we are not to have proper legal advice at our elbow." Therefore it is reasonable to assume that there will have to be some sort of solicitor or legal adviser to the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When such an adviser comes to construe the clause he will follow this line of reasoning. He will say, "I see in Parts III and IV of the Bill some of the functions of the agency. I read in line 3 Page 2 that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of discharging those duties"</p></blockquote>
the agency will have to do the things set out with precision in Parts III and IV."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the agency does not have a legal adviser it should contemplate the legal requirements of the statute under which it is working. I believe that the legal adviser will say, "I find nothing exclusive in the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of discharging those duties".</p></blockquote>
I do not find that we are restricted
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of discharging those duties"</p></blockquote>
to performing the functions conferred by the remainder of the Bill. I know that there was considerable debate in Committee on this point and therefore it did not pass the House of Commons 	<i>per incuriam,</i> unnoticed as it were. We are given general details and the general duty of promoting equality of opportunity and we are therefore committed, nay, obliged because these are duties, to do all kinds of things not specified in Part III if they
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
promote equality of opportunity. We are not told to do only the things in Part III; we are given the general duty of promoting equality of opportunity."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is more the adviser will turn to paragraph (	<i>b</i>) and say "We, of course, have the function which we must perform of doing everything which is laid under Part IV, but we are not restricted to it. We are given the duty of working in every possible way that we can imagine, dream up or think up, for the elimination of discrimination."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I have exaggerated, but I am prepared to concede that I could, to some extent, have exaggerated the width to which this legal adviser might open the doors of the agency. Indeed, I hope—I think I have the sympathy of the right hon. Gentleman in this—that the agency will not be looking for additional work or seeking to increase its activities under the scope of these words. However, it is not really good enough for us to be satisfied with that. Here we are deliberately, by the wording of the clause, opening the door to an undefined series of activities outside of what we shall define and lay down in subsequent parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it is wise to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister of State reflects upon it I do not think he will welcome an agency which will not only do what it is told to do in the Bill—and do it wisely and well—but which will have all sorts of ideas and initiatives of its own, and which, if there is an inquiry, will say "You have given us our charter, a charter which is not in Part III or Part IV of the Bill, but which is covered by the all-embracing duty under Clause 1".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister used an extremely significant word earlier this morning. That word was "interventionist". He used it to qualify part of the duties and functions of the agency as defined in the later part of the Bill. He was not using it pejoratively, and I did not mean to take it pejoratively, but we noted that the word which tripped off the right hon. Gentleman's tongue when he wanted a single description for Part IV was "interventionist". I do not think that my hon. Friends and I could adopt for our part a single word which encapsulates more successfully all the anxieties with which the approach of this Bill inspires us. Our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
fear is that interventionism—intervention for its own sake, intervention which would enable the agency to say that these were the duties it was given and which it is carrying out under the Act—is the implicit danger in the Bill in the form in which it has been brought forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would improve the clause purely as a matter of drafting and concision. But it is an amendment which has a great deal more to it than that, and I hope that the Minister of State will address himself to the potential pitfalls which in its present form the clause contains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have never disagreed at any stage with the main objectives of the Bill. If they are those as set out for the agency in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) we do not agree with the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) or with the right hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford). I agree with the right hon. Member that there is fear of interventionism in some quarters, and that the operation of the Bill is very important and must be carried out with that factor borne in mind. But while the Committee should look carefully into the detail of powers through later amendments—and we shall certainly be doing that—I see no objection to having the general objective of the Bill set out in Clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that many people who will study this legislation or reports of it in the Press will not be lawyers and will not be engaged in the kind of examination of the Bill that we are conducting in Committee. The feeling of ordinary people in these matters have to be considered. If the objectives of the Bill are to promote equality of opportunity and to work for the elimination of discrimination that fact should be set out in Clause 1. For that reason we do not support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to thank the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) for what he has said. It is normal practice, as the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) knows, that the principles of any Bill are normally clearly stated in Clause 1 or Clause 2. The effect of the amendment would be to weaken the Bill in the sense that it is contrary to what the House approved on Second Reading and what the Bill is basically
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
about—eradicating discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member made the point about intervention. As the hon. Member for Abingdon said, we shall be discussing this matter later. Let me make clear what is stated in the Bill, that it would not be sufficient for the agency to rely on the complaints of individuals only since it is quite possible for a person not to be aware that he has been discriminated against, to be ignorant of the remedies available and the procedures to follow, or to be too frightened to make a complaint for fear of subsequent intimidation. Whatever the reason, it is important that action to investigate patterns and trends of employment, and, where necessary, to devise appropriate remedies, shall not have to await a complaint of alleged discrimination.

It is preferable for the agency to advise emloyers and organisations about how they can provide equality of opportunity rather than have no alternative but recourse to the law to enforce equality of opportunity. That is what the Bill means and that is what the amendment seeks to delete. It seeks to remove the guts of the Bill which are clearly the promotion of equality of opportunity in Northern Ireland and working for the elimination of discrimination which is made unlawful by virtue of the Bill. That is what the right hon. Gentleman voted against in principle and that is what the House voted in favour of on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it might save time if I make one point. I listened attentively to what the Minister of State said and he appeared to me to be outlining the powers and duties set out in Part III. The precise question I put to him is this: Will the agency, as a result of the wording of Clause 1, have any powers or duties other than those which are defined and laid down in the remaining clauses? The Minister of State will see the reason for my question. If the answer to that question is "Yes", that Clause 1 is the whole which is larger than the parts of the Bill, the Committee must be told what are the additional powers and duties which Clause 1 confers upon the agency and which we shall not have the opportunity to examine, define and debate in the remaining clauses. That question crystallises the anxieties which it is reasonable to feel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
has put a very fair question. I must make it clear to him and to the Committee that the agency will have no powers beyond Those set out in the Bill. I hope that clears up the point for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a most helpful response. I do not think, however, that it will remove my hon. Friend's criticism of the verbiage of the clause. I am sure that it will certainly remove some of the anxieties which the wording naturally arouses. I have a proposal to put to the Minister of State which he might like to consider since another stage of the Bill is yet to come. He said that the object of Clause 1 was to set out the purpose of the Bill. I conceive that the purpose of the Bill could be written into Clause 1 without it even giving the appearance of widening the scope of the powers and functions of the agency. Since that is the purpose upon which the right hon. Gentleman rests, it probably could be carried out more precisely, and we shall therefore invite the attention of the House at a later stage to an alternative way of doing it with that precision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Neave</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to underline this point for the satisfaction of the Committee will the Minister of State confirm that, apart from the duties and general objectives in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), the only duties that the agency has are those described at lines 3 and 4 on page 2, namely that it:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have the functions conferred on it by this Act."</p></blockquote>
Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reiterate the point which I made to the right hon. Member for Down, South? The agency has only the functions set out in the Bill. There are no other functions that it has, can take or would be able to operate outside the terms of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State said that the Committee was concerned with sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, and he hoped that the Bill would go some way to eradicate that problem. If the Minister thinks that sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland has anything to do,
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
even remotely, with employment or equality of opportunity he is sadly mistaken. There are many causes of sectarian conflict and what is sometimes confused with sectarian conflict. One of the primary reasons is not any lack of opportunity in employment. If we believe that this Bill might lessen conflict we are fooling ourselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one needs to preach to my right hon. and hon. Friends about sectarian conflict. We have lived with it in its most vicious form for the past eight years, and, perhaps, to some extent for the whole of our lives. We have seen the effect on our neighbours and on our work forces. We have seen the scars on the people who were lucky enough to survive. We have had to witness the brutality on the corpses lying in the coffins in the too many houses that we have had to visit in Northern Ireland. If it could be proved that this sectarian conflict had anything to do with employment opportunity I would welcome the Bill with open arms because it might help to solve the problem. But that is not the cause of the trouble and it is therefore foolish to use that argument in support of the Bill.

I have tried, in the few days available, to take some account of the opinions of the people working in industry in Northern Ireland. It should be remembered that the case for this legislation is made, not only by the Minister but by his right hon. Friends and others. The case was made also that the demand came from industry and from the men and women in industry in Northern Ireland. When one considers sectarian conflict it is interesting to note that 85 per cent of the firms which responded to my questions—and I have had responses from more than 60 companies employing more than 20,000 people, ranging from large international companies to small indigenous companies employing numbers varying from 1,700 to 16 people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Member goes on may I say that T have seen copies of the questionnaire and that the questions are inaccurate and entirely misleading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Read it out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One question was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Has the unrest of the past seven years affected relationships between people of different religions in your factory?"</p></blockquote>
I do not know what could be misleading about that. Eighty-five of the companies, including many from the constituency of the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) and companies on the peace line and other companies working in the most atrocious circumstances of lack of security said that unrest had not affected the relationship between the various religious groupings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do people of different religious beliefs work harmoniously in your factory?"</p></blockquote>
What is dangerous or misleading about asking that? The response was that 96 per cent of the companies who replied claimed that people of different religious beliefs worked harmoniously in their factories. Many of them were saying "thank goodness that is so".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are two out of the ten questions. Another asked the name of the company. Another asked for the total number of employees. What is misleading about those questions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does your company accept the stated objectives of the Bill, 'To promote equality of opportunity in employment in Northern Ireland between people of different religious beliefs'?"</p></blockquote>
That is five out of ten questions. It may well be that some of the other five are dangerous and misleading. It was not my intention to make them so. My intention was to try to elicit from the people working in industry in Northern Ireland their opinion on this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member puts his case forcibly but he is fair. Will he agree that one question dealt with the Fair Employment Agency and spoke of requiring employees to record and disclose the religious affiliations of their work force? I think he knows that it is totally untrue as is his implication that the Bill provides for the keeping of a register of the religious beliefs of employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mccusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do you believe that the keeping of a register of the religious beliefs of your employees will he helpful in guaranteeing equal opportunity?"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
With respect, that is not what the Minster said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the third paragraph of the letter sent out by the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) it is said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, the means of achieving this objective adopted in the Bill is to establish a Fair Employment Agency, which will be empowered to require employers to record and disclose the religious affiliations of their workforce".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given the specific question they were asked which varies slightly from what the Minister said. I refer to page 24 of the Working Party Report. It was stated that the agency's powers and functions should include the collection and keeping of records of religious affiliation. I refer the Minister to Clause 12. This investigation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing Clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it difficult to answer the allegations without referring to Clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. My hon. Friends and I are critical in principle of the approach by way of agency to the objects in Clause 1. As a sign of that we shall in due course dissent from the Question that this be a clause of the Bill. I take it that we would be entitled, in debating whether the clause should be a clause of the Bill, to consider the operation of the agency in principle, as it is envisaged, since that is the heart of the Bill and refusal to accept the motion which you will eventually put would nullify that whole approach to fair employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct. I am interpreting Clause 1 as broadly as possible but I had to point out that while Clause 12 might be touched upon, it would not be in order to have a full debate on the details of Clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate what you say. Mrs. Jeger, and I apologise for any deviation into which T was drawn on consideration of the questionnaire, which related specifically to Clause 1. If the Minister is assuring me that questions I

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
asked in the questionnaire are not implicit in the Bill I am happy. I do not have his resources. Six questions are innocuous and one or two might be questionable. If the Minister wants to sit down with me and compose a questionnaire to send to every employer I am happy to abide by the result if the Minister will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This question does not arise for the Committee in its discussion of Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was about to quote another aspect from the questionnaire which I hope will have some influence in the Committee. The central theme in the questionnaire has been thrown into doubt and I do not know whether it is worth doing. I asked whether those questioned supported the objective of the Bill. A total of 98 per cent. replied that they did. I also asked whether they thought that the proposals in the Bill would promote that objective and 91 per cent., nine out of ten companies replied that they did not think so. I do not know whether that question was loaded or dangerous. Those who did not say that said that they were not so sure and answered "Some parts 'yes', some parts 'no'", or "We are uncertain whether legislation could accomplish this", or, "We do not believe the legislation is suitable", or "We do not know whether it will exert the same pressure on employers as the Sex Discrimination Act and whether that will affect the situation." Others said "Bill or no Bill we shall not ask anyone what his religion is."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the degree of support which exists in industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hen. Member care to say whether he circulated a similar questionnaire for the Employment Protection Bill? I recall that he was a member of the Standing Committee which considered that Bill. Does he seriously think that if he had circulated a questionnaire he would have got—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Bill. The hon. Member for Armagh will be out of order if he answers that question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I contend that this Bill and the contents of this clause will go no

way to supporting our objective. We come back to the whole question of discrimination and to what degree it exists. Not a single firm—and I accept this answer—said that it selected people on the basis of religious affiliation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. J. D. Concannon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that surprising?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That probably would not be surprising if the replies had come only from personnel managers. But a substantial number of the replies came from senior shop stewards. In circulating the questionnaires I sent one to the management and another to shop stewards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What answer did the hon. Member expect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we are to believe all we read about what happens in the North-East of England we would believe that corruption exists there in politics to some degree. Even if that is proved in a court of law we cannot make a blanket allegation that all involved in local government are potentially corrupt. If it existed to that extent an agency should call all councillors together to lecture them on the dangers of corruption and what can be done to avoid it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill suggests that major international companies with reputations second to none and with personnel management controlled far away from Northern Ireland should allow their personnel managers to be brought to conferences and the like and lectured on what they can do to provide equality of opportunity—as if they did not already do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The work-place has been the only area of sanity in Northern Ireland. We have watched conflict on the streets at night and somehow people have patched up their differences and gone back to work the next morning. The replies to my questionnaire have supported that contention and the discussion I had with the Northern Ireland Committee supported that. Yet we have been allowed to believe that sectarian conflict and its causes spring from the factories and work-places of Northern Ireland. That is a nonsense. This decent working relationship will he interrupted by unwarranted interference and intervention. Of course, in all the correspondence I have had this is the thing they fear most. The agency and the

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
powers which we are vesting in it are feared most.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Government reply during the Second Reading the Under-Secretary quoted a list of bodies which had been consulted, as if they were supporting the Bill. As well as sending out to industry, I wrote to those bodies and asked their opinion. I received some interesting replies. I think the first body mentioned was the British Institute of Management. Its Northern Ireland office replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After some discussion it was unanimously agreed that the Regional Board for N. Ireland did not advocate the setting up of special legislation on the lines of the Race Relations Act, or a Tribunal."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is my understanding that the opinion of our Board was communicated in writing to the N. Ireland Office shortly afterwards."</p></blockquote>
The Methodist Church in Ireland—one of the few one can make contact with; there is never any answer from the others—also replied. The Council on Social Welfare sent two pages of criticism of the Bill, and said this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our main objection to the Report was in the relation to the suggestion for a Fair Employment Agency…we are not at all convinced that the Fair Employment Agency is the way to go about it. We don't like the idea of establishing the religious division legally, and we don't think that it is workable."</p></blockquote>
Another body—and I think the Under-Secretary referred to a similar one—called the Ulster Citizens' Civil Liberties Advice Centre described the agency as "another piece of bureaucratic machinery" and there was also a reply from the County Grand Lodge of Belfast. You will not expect me to quote that Mrs. Jeger. The submission from the Church of Ireland perhaps sums up the attitudes of many people in Northern Ireland. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are strong social pressures to conform to the fashionable denunciation of religious discrimination as the prime cause of disorder in Northern Ireland. Any criticism of the Report would undoubtedly get a bad Press."</p></blockquote>
We know there is something in what it says. It adds that we should
	<br><blockquote><p>"consider carefully whether the cure may not be worse than the disease".</p></blockquote>
However incomplete my inquiry has been it was done with the best intentions in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell us what body of the Church of Ireland that was?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was the Church Committee dealing with the report of the Working Party on discrimination. I can give the hon. Gentleman the details afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants the proper title to appear in the 	<i>Official Report</i> he might read it out clearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is "Report and Recommendations of the Working Party on Discrimination in the Private Sector of Employment in 1973". It is just called a Church committee. I wrote to it and asked for information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We found nothing in our researches to support the contention that this Bill would do anything but harm in Northern Ireland. Sixty employers in Northern Ireland think the same and not quite 60, but a substantial number of trade unionists in Northern Ireland believe the same. It is for that reason that we shall continue to take the approach to this Bill that we have taken this morning. We will vote against Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) in the course of his remarks said that he and his colleagues were broadly in support of the stated objective of the Bill. All I can say is that they could have fooled me. Certainly when one reads of their total opposition to the Second Reading of this Bill and sees their total opposition to this most important clause in the Bill one must be fairly convinced that they are in total opposition to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has taken it upon himself on several occasions in the course of the debate on this clause to cast himself in the role of spokesman for the trade union movement in Northern Ireland. The facts are that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is totally committed to supporting this Bill. The hon. Gentleman keeps referring to trade unionists to whom he has spoken. There are in Northern Ireland trade unionists and trade unionists. There are those who are members of the trade union movement and who are in full support of the objectives of the trade union movement. There are others who would claim to speak for the trade union movement but who are nothing more or less than bigots. Those people can be quite clearly and correctly identified and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
anyone here who accepted them as spokesmen for the trade union movement would be making a grave mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has said that he circulated a questionnaire among a number of employers. But the questions, of which the Committee has been made aware this morning, were loaded questions. They were specifically drawn up to get the correct answer and to give the impression that all employers are totally opposed to this legislation. It is the recommendations of the committee which was set up under the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) to investigate whether it was necessary to initiate this type of legislation—and it has been agreed that his committee did a tremendous service to the people of Northern Ireland—which are now being put into practice by this Government. So it is not a question of a mad, Socialist, Left-oriented or Communist Government making an attack on the decent employers in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seeks to give the impression that there has never been any discrimination in employment in Northern Ireland—that everything was all right and it is only trouble-makers who were involved in the promulgation of the report and now in the initiation of this legislation. I recall the matter of the Belfast Rope Works. How many people of different religions were employed there? Everyone will recall the controversy which raged for many years between the Roman Catholics of Down and Connaught and the management there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the famous controversy which raged over many years in Northern Ireland, and to which there was no conclusion, concerning Rolls-Royce, a firm which is now in difficulties and is seeking assistance from this Government. It has sent deputations to lobby Ministers. I remember when it first set up in Northern Ireland, in Dundonald. I, as a Socialist, was delighted to see the introduction of a new industry in Northern Ireland. I would have deep and bitter regrets if that company was not to remain in Northern Ireland, because I am concerned with people getting employment, whatever their religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I cannot forget that a very small minority of Catholics were employed in that firm, only one-twentieth of the total work force. The factory had been in operation a short time when a number of
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
Catholics were going to work one morning at ten past eight. They were getting out of their Volkswagen when someone standing there with a machine-gun opened fire on them. I think two of them were murdered and the rest seriously injured. The rest of the Catholics who were employed in that firm came to me and my colleagues the next day and said that they were afraid to go back to their work because they might be assassinated. It is conditions of that sort that we are talking about in this legislation. Those Catholics left, and I am not sure whether there is a single Catholic still working for Rolls-Royce. That is the reason for this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also the Belfast shipyards. It will be conceded by everyone that they have been in serious difficulties for a number of years and have received vast amounts of money from the Northern Ireland Exchequer and latterly from the United Kingdom Exchequer. That money was given with the intention of creating employment and getting persons good employment, not with the intention of keeping a certain religious faction in employment and totally excluding another faction because of its religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can think too of Curry's, the woodwork firm on the Springfield Road in Belfast, where a few workers, Catholics and Protestants, were travelling over a certain area to get to their employment. They were met by a burst of machine-gun fire which killed some and injured others. It was thought at that time that the lorry taking the workers to their employment was carrying only Caholics. A mistake was made, and Catholic and Protestant workers alike were lying dead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could go back to remarks made by former Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland. One I remember very well, and it will not readily be forgotten, was by a former Minister of Agriculture, made to a meeting of industrialists in Northern Ireland. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I appeal to my audience not to employ Roman Catholics. I would not have one about the place."</p></blockquote>
That is on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to make his own remarks on this Bill. What I am saying can be verified from the facts of life in Northern Ireland.

The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) said he had had a meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and it supported him in saying there was an oasis of sanity in the industrial workshops in Northern Ireland. That again is untrue. I was speaking to some members of the Congress immediately after the hon. Member. I have known them for many years and I found them to be totally and absolutely incensed by a statement which had been given to the Press a day previously by the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford) calling for opposition to what is now happening in Northern Ireland. The trade unions are trying to involve the community in a demand for peace, prosperity and good will. That did not have the support of the hon. Member for Belfast, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Armagh has said that certain trade unionists agreed with him. I would like to know who they are because the members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to whom I was speaking—and that is the overall body of trade unions in Northern Ireland—did not agree. I am not prepared to stand up in this Committee and say I was talking to Jim Smith, one of the Rolls-Royce shop stewards, who told me he did not like the Bill. I know that Jim Smith and other trade unionists of his ilk were engaged in planning warfare against the political institutions in Northern Ireland in 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill comes before this Committee not because we believe—I certainly do not—that once the Bill becomes law discrimination will cease the next day. That would be too much to expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least it will lay the basis and point out that there has been discrimination in industrial establishments in Northern Ireland. It will point out to the Northern Ireland community that we as a Parliament are opposed to the kind of discriminatory actions that took place. This is an appeal to our friends and to employers to take all possible means to ensure that employment is given to people who need it on the basis of ability and not because they adhere to one political or religious ethic.

I find it difficult to understand why we are meeting with such total opposition to this Bill when its intention is to create a better system and to try to do away with
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
hostilities which have existed in the industrial sphere in Northern Ireland. Who is to say that discrimination in unemployment was not connected with the upsurge of the present trouble in Northern Ireland? I remember very well in 1966, and in 1967 and 1968—long before there was a campaign of violence in Northern Ireland—bringing to the notice of the House the discrimination which existed in many areas of life in Northern Ireland, particularly housing and employment. Had steps been taken to eradicate the evil of discrimination in Northern Ireland we might not have arrived at a day when gunmen were able to take to the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Bill is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is necessary. It tries to create accord. It tries to create in Northern Ireland conditions which will eradicate discrimination in employment and make for equal opportunity for everyone in seeking employment. As such, I find it difficult to accept the sincerity of some hon. Members opposite. I feel they must have some other reason at the backs of their minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Your brief interruption, Mrs. Jeger, of the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) pinpointed with admirable clarity the fallacy in which he is genuinely involved and which tends to dominate this kind of discussion—the confusion between end and means, between intention and method. As you reminded him and the Committee, Clause 1 is concerned with method. In an earlier exchange between myself and the Minister I suggested that if he wanted Clause 1 to express the intention, not the method, it was badly drafted for that purpose. As it is, it is a method clause. It lays down the method which the Bill seeks to adopt for achieving certain objects.

It is, of course, part of the basic stock-in-trade of political argument to confuse object with method, and for those who advocate certain methods of achieving something desirable to accuse their opponents of not wanting it because they dare to criticise the method and even to suggest that the method might be counterproductive. If we are to have a sensible debate, as I am sure we all wish, we have the object and rejecting the method. There to keen a distinction between accenting

is no contradiction or insincerity here. It is a point which has to be argued out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our case—and I am not sure whether it does not go further than this place—is that the method adopted in this Bill is not calculated to achieve the object. My hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) has performed, in respect of method, an important service. I draw attention to paragraph 4, of the questionnaire, already referred to which he circulated and to which he has had such a prompt and surprisingly widespread response. The question was concerned with method, and as it were, with Clause 1 of the Bill. It asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does your company believe the proposals of the Fair Employment Bill will promote this objective?"</p></blockquote>
I cannot really think that that was an unfair or leading question to put. It was, after all, the question put to the House of Commons on Second Reading and it is the question which will be put to this Committee when the motion, "That the Clause stand part," is moved, namely: Do you believe that the proposals for fair unemployment, the approach by way of a Fair Employment Agency, will promote the objective of equality of employment in Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a fair and necessary question because we have been assured, not just that the objectives of the Bill were widely welcomed by certain bodies in Northern Ireland but we have been led to believe, that the method adopted in the Bill and proposed by the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Gentleman wants to be fair on this issue. He has referred to the questionnaire produced by his hon. Friend. He must not take that questionaire out of context, because with it was sent a letter. It was the letter that gave the slant. The loaded questions asked were under-written by the letter. The right hon. Gentleman will agree that in a free society people can ask questions and seek what information they wish from any quarter. But it is wrong then to come to this Committee and speak as if this were a completely unbiased questionnaire thought up by the hon. Gentleman principally on the basis that he was in favour of the Bill. Surely the right hon. Gentleman does not accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nobody would be in any doubt as to the view of my hon. Friend
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
on the Bill. He made a speech against it during Second Reading and voted against it. The debate is on the question whether the Bill will conduce to the objective we seek. In those circumstances, naturally, members of the public have to be consulted by those who are to speak on one side or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of what my hon. Friend has done and the response to it is that so often when an amendment is proposed in Committee those who support it say that its objectives are universally regarded as desirable, The representative bodies fall over themselves to urge that the archetypal bodies agree. In this case these were the the CBI and ICTU. We would be moving into the millennium if those bodies, when approached for their view on whether a Fair Employment Agency would be a good thing, had come out and said, "No, we think it would be a bad thing". But my hon. Friend has gone below the archetypal roots of such organisations and has asked the views of people in positions of responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As no doubt those members of the Committee who are on such bodies have found, when a fashionable idea gets going it is very difficult for collective bodies to stand against them. One finds the truth only when people are asked individually. I was surprised by the alacrity with which responsible employers and large numbers of people thought it right to answer these specific questions. The value of those responses is that they show that when the question of method is put separately from the question of object to people actually involved in the job, their advice does not bear out the formal, conventional view so often given to committees of investigation and to the Government by the CBI, the ICTU and other representative bodies at the top. Like it or not, these are the views of the elite. These are the answers they have freely chosen to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of consultation, the right hon. Gentleman gives the idea that there is at the top of the ICTU or the CBI a body completely unrelated to the industries in which they work. The Working Party Report was widely circulated throughout industry in Northern Ireland and the response was overwhelmingly in favour of the proposals. That is the answer I give to the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has one very endearing characteristic. He is so innocent in these matters. It is one thing for the CBI to take up a position in regard to a question by a Working Party or Committee and circularise it to its members. Only a small minority of difficult chaps are going to say, "It think you have been talking twaddle, judging by experience in my job". Here we have got behind the facade and have got to the relevance, the kind of view of the Bill held by shop stewards and employers employing large and small work forces in Northern Ireland. I do not regard the results of the questionnaire as binding on me and it should not be binding on the House. Its importance is that it sets us free from the idea that there is here a small group of Members of Parliament setting themselves up against the universal opinion entertained by all decent and experienced persons. The reality is very different.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is putting great emphasis on this questionnaire and the replies to it but we have not had the detailed replies before this Committee. Nor have we had the names of firms or shop stewards' committees that replied to his hon. Friend. Are we to have those?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend, within the limits of your discipline Mrs. Jeger, has given a good deal of information to the Committee and will certainly make more available in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
selected way, subject to any confidentiality as to identity, and will be entirely frank about the answers he has received, the size of firms and the relationship between the answers received and the number of inquiries sent out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this respect my hon. Friend benefits from a characteristic which I have found in Northern Ireland—one of the differences between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. It is that the people there, taken by and large, are very much franker, man for man, in stating their real opinion and answering a straight question in a straight fashion than is the convention on this side of the water. I was particularly impressed by the replies on the method chosen, which brings me back to the central point which we have to get clear, the difference between objective and method.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here we have a choice. The object, by definition, must be to schieve as far as it is in our power the aims which the Bill sets. Nevertheless, we believe that the method adopted will do more harm than good. As we go through the clauses of the Bill we shall have an opportunity of illustrating how the functions assigned to the agency will, in our opinion, not assist but will be counterproductive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
