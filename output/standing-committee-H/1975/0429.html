	<p>	<i>Further Amendment proposed [27th April],</i> No. 12, in page 2, line 35, leave out from "corporation" to end of line 39 and insert "specified in Schedule 1".—[	<i>Mr. Raison.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying on Tuesday that my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) had gone through the list taken from the Stevenage working party report. When we adjourned I was quoting from the report. The members of the working party were all experienced people, and the object of setting up the working party was to have people with knowledge of new towns to suggest practical and relevant proposals for the transfer procedure. The report says the list is not exhaustive, but that it seemed to make common sense. That is the approach we want. We all wish to reach the same end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand the Government's thinking about flexibility, and we acknowledge that it is necessary on occasions, but we are dealing with a fairly finite matter. On the ground, it is clear what should be transferred and our list is pretty exhautive. Nothing much could get through its net. A degree of fishing might be required to put in some odd items, though there is nothing I can think of, and the working party could not think of anything else either. The working party said that if something obviously had to be put into the list, the logic of the case on the ground would mean that it could be included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are a little hesitant about giving the Minister the sweeping powers in this clause because hon. Members who have served in local government will know of cases where local authorities believe the
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
law is quite clear, but then the Secretary of State sends out a contrary directive. It is unhealthy to leave too much discretion to the Secretary of State to decide on matters unless, for example, they are vital to the national interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have great hesitation in approving this flexibile approach. We believe the list should be spelled out. We rest our case very much on the working party report. Its members were experts, and spent a great deal of time considering the matter. They produced a good report which we should not lightly reject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Guy Barnett)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to try to help the Committee on this matter. From what the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) has been saying, I am convinced that our purposes are the same. We believe they are better achieved by the drafting of the Bill than by the alternatives he has suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member rightly said that these decisions should be taken by the people involved, rather than being left to the discretion of the Secretary of State. The trouble with his suggested schedule is that it is tightly drawn, and assets may not be able to be transferred because they are not included in the list. Even though, in logic, it may appear to those engaged in the negotiations that an asset should be transferred, the fact that it did not appear in the schedule would inevitably create difficulties. The Government had to move Amendment No. 8 on Tuesday because we discovered an interest which we had not previously realised might need to be transferred, and which was not covered, even by the flexibility clause in the Bill. How much greater, therefore, is the danger of that kind of thing happening with the schedule proposed by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the working party's list as a clear guideline—and that was all the working party intended it to be—to the parties in transfer negotiations. The hon. Member for Northampton, South said it was clear on the ground what needed to be transferred. That is true, but there is rightly a great variety between new town areas. Individuals on the ground will wish to decide on the assets to be transferred. That discretion is much
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
more for the parties concerned than for the Secretary of State. The new town corporations and the district councils will have to agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to correct an impression I may have given to the Committee on Tuesday. I have not yet studied the 	<i>Hansard</i> of our proceedings, but I may have suggested that rent offices will have to be transferred. This is not the case. It is a matter for agreement between the parties. If a district council did not want to use a new town corporation rent office the parties could agree that it would not be involved in the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our flexibility is designed to meet a variety of circumstances and to suit the individual needs of new towns. We want to enable new town corporations and district councils to come to amicable and sensible agreements about what should be transferred and how it should be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 15, in page 2, line 44, leave out 'annulment' and insert 'affirmative resolution'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we are to discuss Amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 44, leave out 'either House' and insert 'both Houses'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should, perhaps, have risen at the conclusion of the last debate to say that, having thought carefully about what the Minister said, his approach seemed reasonable to us. We may wish to think about it further and perhaps come back to it on the Report. I accept the Minister's view that the Government are looking for a reasonably flexible approach, and there is something in his argument that it is not easy to specify in advance all the assets which may have to be transferred. We are prepared to give the Government the benefit of the doubt, at least for the time being, and that is why we did not press the amendment to a Division. I should have said that before the Government were so nearly defeated by nearly failing to answer "No" to the Question. This is another example of the demoralisation which has led to the extraordinary behaviour of the Labour Party over Committee procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
The aim of Amendments No. 15 and 16 is to substitute the affirmative resolution procedure for the negative procedure for the orders under the clause. The business of substituting the affirmative procedure for the negative procedure has probably taken up more Committee hours than any other subject. It is a general rule of parliamentary life that Oppositions prefer the affirmative procedure and Governments prefer the negative procedure. The Government and previous Leader of the House caused genuine alarm by the way in which they talked about encouraging enabling legislation. It is not just a matter of an Opposition grumbling when I say this approach is profoundly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know we are living in a world with a different philosophy to law-making from our own. While not doubting the many advantages of joining the EEC, we shall have to ask ourselves a number of questions about our parliamentary procedure. The British approach to lawmaking over the centuries has been pragmatic rather than theoretical. We wait till a problem arises and then deal with it as competently as possible. In consequence, nearly every item in our legislation, however boring and unintelligible it may be to some people, is of very great importance. The philosophy that more matters should be decided by orders rather than in the Acts is one which should be watched very carefully. I was recently reading a famous book written by Lord Hewart on this subject in the 1920s. No doubt my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. More) was nurtured on this book, which sets out the dangers of a move towards delegated legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not, with these amendments, just reacting in the normal Opposition manner. There are genuine reasons why they should be adopted. Essentially, this matter boils down to the importance of the topic. The general convention is that if something is not so important and contentious, the negative procedure is tolerable, but on a matter of major importance or real significance within the structure of an Act, the affirmative procedure is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have in previous debates clarified the nature of the order referred to in subsection (3)(	<i>g</i>). This was helpful, because I did not understand exactly what the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
order was about. It seemed it could be read as either specific or general and could relate to the circumstances of a particular transfer scheme rather than to something of general application to all subsequent schemes. My understanding of what the Minister said on Tuesday is that once an order has been made it is of general application to all transfer schemes and cannot be specific to a particular one. Under subsection 4 it is possible for this order to be varied or revoked by subsequent order. Anyway we have cleared that matter up. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to argue that these orders which may or may not be made subsequently are clearly an inherent part of the Bill itself. They are not, in my view, something which can, therefore, legitimately be regarded solely in the terms of delegated legislation. When we talk of delegated legislation we talk of legislation the basis of which, and the power for the making of which, are established in the Act. Perhaps there are details with which we did not want to clutter the Act; perhaps events, it was thought, might develop requiring Ministers to take actions in particular circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that applies in this case. This order-making power is giving the Government the right or power to introduce an order which will not be implementing what is in the Bill already but which, in effect, will be an additional subsection of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether I make myself clear but there is a real difference between the two. Normally an order is based on something which appears in an Act, which says that, for the purpose of working out how the scheme will be operated, the Minister may bring to the House an order to implement the scheme. What this clause is essentially saying is that we have thought of the number of contingencies which are expressed in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>), (	<i>d</i>), (	<i>e</i>), (	<i>f</i>). We have in humility or prudence or common sense to admit that there may well be things we have not thought out. The Minister was saying on Tuesday that there may well be things we have not thought about and that they will crop up at subsequent times and we want
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
to be in a position to incorporate those things when they come up at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the need for being able to deal with contingencies which have not been dreamed up, possibilities not covered by the Stevenage working party, for example, or things which the 80,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment have not been able to imagine. We accept that the Government have to find ways of dealing with those contingencies or possibilities, but what essentially will happen, when one of those possibilities arises, is that an extra bit of the Bill will be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ideal place for that extra bit of the Bill would be in an addition to the Bill. If one were being purist, one would say that the Government should pass amending legislation, but in view of the fact that the Government have already got more than enough legislation on their plate I am prepared to forgo insisting that there should be that further legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a corollary of that we are entitled to ask that when they do have to make an order it should at least have a chance to be properly debated. Everybody knows that an order which is subject only to the negative procedure does not normally have a chance of being properly debated. It is one of the great problems of our parliamentary life that we have these orders, but that if we are able to talk about them, that is looked upon as being almost miraculous. We know perfectly well that the negative procedure is haphazard, and it is a matter of chance whether we have an order debated on the Floor of the House. By and large, when the official Opposition put down a Prayer they will have some chance of getting it taken on the Floor of the House. However, that is not a certainty. There is no guarantee that if a Prayer is put down by leading figures of the Opposition the Government will allow time for it. Debates on Prayers are subject to strict limitation on time. I understand one does not get two hours, but that the debate lapses at 11.30 pm automatically. We have had occasions when important Prayers have been allowed the minimal period of debate, and this is unsatisfactory. This applies also to official Opposition Prayers, and if the official Opposition have that difficulty in getting something debated, how much worse it is for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
Back Bench Prayers. Governments are markedly unenthusiastic about allowing Back Benchers' Prayers against Government orders. It is recognised that this is an unsatisfactory procedure, but nobody seems to be clear how it can be remedied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case we are talking about something which is an extension of the Bill rather than a legitimate piece of delegated legislation. In view of this there is a strong case for insisting that this Order should be taken under the affirmative procedure and for saying that the Government approach, as expressed in subsections (4) and (5) is inadequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jasper More</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I hope this is not to be the ministerial reply now. The arguments of my hon. Friend were so cogent and compelling that we shall all want to reinforce them before completing discussion on this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly willing for the hon. Member to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ray Mawby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As many hon. Members will know, I always object in principle to the negative procedure. Unless one continues to do this the draftsmen of Bills are inclined to become more sloppy and say "As it is so difficult to get the wording right, let us just put 'power of the Minister to act by negative resolution' in the Bill". This is basically bad, and wherever the Minister is given power to proceed by order there must be very good reasons for such a procedure to be followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had some bad experiences even in the recent past from the operation of the power of Ministers to act by order. It is only very recently that I, with some of my colleagues, put down a Prayer against the 1974 order dealing with sewerage charges. The then Leader of the House from time to time quite naturally said there was insufficient time for that Prayer to be debated, and eventually the time allowed elapsed, and the debate lapsed. We all know what happened as a result of the House not being able to discuss it. It meant that the order was made; subsequently there was a High Court decision, which was subsequently backed by the House of Lords,
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
and which involved local authority treasurers throuhgout the country in a great deal more work than they would have had to do had we been able to debate the order in the House, so that the order would never have been operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is only one example of procedure by negative resolution. It ought to be an example to us all, that wherever power is given to proceed by order that the least one can do is to require that it should be by affirmative order to that, in a busy parliamentary programme, the Leader of the House would not have to keep telling us that unfortunately there is insufficient time to discuss an order under the negative procedure, even if a large number of us have attached our name to a Prayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was quite right in saying that normally if the Leader of the Opposition, along with the principal members of the Shadow Cabinet, puts down a Prayer there is a much better chance of its being dealt with and time being given, but it is not always possible even then. I have heard the Leader of the House often refer to the fact that the Opposition have Supply Days and, therefore, they have alternative ways of arguing a particular point. That is not the same as being able to argue in detail the wording of an order which is brought—and would be brought, if this clause remains as it is—to the House by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least we would see from our proposed schedule hereditaments and objects on which the Minister would be able to proceed by order and we would at least know what we would be talking about. Where the order is the result of a local authority and a corporation being engaged in a bit of horse trading we ought to know what power the Minister has over what pieces of property, before we proceed any further with this Bill. The least we can do is to change the clause so that when the Minister acts by order it must definitely be by affirmative order, which means that the Minister will have to present that order and give Parliament power to debate it—not only here, but in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jasper More</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to reinforce with all the power at my command the forceful speeches already made by my hon. Friend. My hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) delicately referred to the fact of how fortunate it was to have at least one senior Member of the Committee present. Of course, engraved on my heart, as a young and struggling lawyer, is the word of Lord Hewart in that great volume" The New Despotism", which created such a sensation at the time when most members of this Committee were not even born.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was really a case of poacher turned gamekeeper because Lord Hewart's younger years were spent going to the House of Commons and putting through masses of ill-thought out legislation of the Liberal kind because Mr. Lloyd George wanted to be in nice places like Rapallo and Montreux. Like most bad things in Parliament all these pieces of excessive legislation and delegated legislation were started by the Liberal Party. They have all been enthusiastically taken up and made far worse by the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest example we have in this Bill. In this clause it seems to be assumed, in subsections (4) and (5), that the Minister can just make orders. There is nothing said in the early part of the clause about orders. It begins by simply saying" a scheme may be made". I would not have thought a scheme necessarily equal to an order, but this is the bland way in which it is now assumed in Acts of Parliament that a Minister can do this and that through orders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Hewart, in reward for those many nights spent pushing ill digested Liberal legislation through the House of Commons, was made Lord Chief Justice. The precise method by which that was done is interesting. It is also interesting to see how a previous Lord Chief Justice was disposed of. But I pass over that. When he was Lord Chief Justice he discovered increasingly that the power of the courts of justice was more and more obstructed and vitiated by the increasing tendency of Parliament, inspired by Mr. Lloyd George and the Liberals, to do everything by ministerial order. In that way the jurisdiction of the courts was often excluded and the subject was deprived of his lawful rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite sure it would be the feeling of all fair-minded Members of this Committee, even those on the Labour side, that they would not want to intensify
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
this evil in anything we do. We are very proud of our Parliament. My hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury made a comparison with the European Parliament. We were very mistaken ever to be involved with the European Parliament. I will not go into that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. More</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is in a place called Strasbourg, or Brussels, or Luxembourg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about our Parliament, and I would say two things about it. First, we have too many laws. The Labour Party, following the bad example of the Liberals, run through as many laws as possible, badly drafted, hardly debated, and unintelligible when they finally appear. In the good old days of Lord Hewart it was still possible to compress the annual output of Parliament into one moderately slim volume. When one now looks at the Library shelves one finds that, for most years, there are three volumes for each year. It is idiotic to suppose that anybody understands what is being done or what is the effect of all these laws. We ought also to have on those shelves bound volumes of all the orders made each year under delegated legislation. If they were put side by side I imagine they would occupy an entire shelf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is that process which Parliament should set itself to correct. That process is an exercise for providing employment for civil servants and bureaucrats. I am sure their talents would be better employed in doing other things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an abuse that these laws do not have proper consideration. As my hon. Friends have pointed out, there are two ways in which Parliament, however inadequately, can give consideration to delegated legislation of this kind—by what we call the affirmative and the negative procedure. Both procedures are apt to be highly inadequate, and much more inadequate for private Members than for others, because private Members are at the mercy of the Government of the day in deciding whether to give them time; and they are seldom given time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those here concerned with the liberties and rights of the Back Benchers should support this amendment and thus
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
help to strike a blow for freedom. If one is a Minister or a civil servant it is easier to say the negative procedure shall apply. If the words "subject to annulment" remain the order goes through unless either the official Opposition think it of sufficient importance to put down the necessary motion on the Order Paper and thereby force the Government to agree to a debate, or some fortunate Back Bencher gets time. In either case it is an abbreviated and unsatisfactory way to debate such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is no small matter. The scheme could be an enormous operation involving the value of the property, rights, liabilities and obligations, and all the dwellings, and so on, set out in the paragraphs of subsection (3). Looked at in terms of the value of the assets it could involve millions, tens of millions or hundreds of millions of pounds. We are not only talking of the value of the property but also of the consequences resulting for a vast variety of interests, starting with the local authorities, going on to the traders and business men in the area, and finally, most important of all, all the residents and people involved with the houses with which a scheme of this kind would primarily be concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will agree, on second thoughts, that this is no small matter. In carrying through legislation of this kind Parliament should at least see that the maximum opportunity is given for proper debate on the Floor. That involves the affirmative rather than the negative procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hordern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. More) has brought me to my feet by his cogent speech. He has reminded me of the extent to which the level of Government business has risen. He said that the Liberals were responsible for creating far too much legislation and that this bad practice has been followed by the Labour Party in successive Governments. It is, perhaps, of interest to recall that in 1832, long before the Labour Party came into existence, comment was made on the extent to which Government business was bearing down on Members of Parliament. The Chancellor of the Exchequer at that time, Lord Althorp, made it quite clear
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
to the Treasury that unless all the papers were ready for signature on a Tuesday morning the papers would have to wait until the following week, for he would not have time for them before. Regrettably, we have moved on from that stage and we are now faced with never-ending legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The use of the negative procedure is a dangerous practice and one which is used far too often. As my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) so rightly said, it is a considerable temptation to Government to use this procedure in order to get through legislation, and to introduce legislation which has not previously been considered by the back door, as it were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By using this negative procedure it will be possible, so it seems, for the Government to allow any take-over by the local authorities of New Towns Commission property, assets or land which they had not previously considered taking over. The particular example I have in mind is the amount of land owned at present by the New Towns Commission in Crawley near Gatwick Airport. Until now that land has been considered unsuitable for development for the very good reason that it lies within the highest possible noise zone. This land is now to be transferred to the local authority. It may be that the local authority will decide that the noise levels are not unnecessarily high, that it will not pay regard to them, and will decide to build houses in that area. I do not know whether this would be subject to this sort of resolution. It is certainly a matter on which the Government should make their views clear—that is to say, whtther the local authority should have regard to noise-free areas in the same way as does the New Towns Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
A substantial amount of land is involved. In the ordinary course of events, I am sure the local authority, if it were not for Gatwick's expansion, would wish to use that land for its own building programme. This will become even more difficult because of the Government's decision to cancel the airport at Maplin. This has inevitably meant the development of other airports—Heathrow, Gatwick and also Stansted and Luton. The South-East Region has made some forecasts about what the development of these airports might involve. For example, it would be possible for the number of passengers going through Gatwick to rise from the present 10 million a year to about 25 million a year. This would mean the employment of not the present 10,000 workers but 16,000, eventually rising to a total of 25,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crawley is a town which is still expanding very quickly as a result of the natural growth of its industry. Expansion at Gatwick by a national policy superimposed upon the natural growth of Crawley, will put Crawley Council into an impossible situation. At present it does not have the land to build the houses which such expansion requires, nor is there any prospect of Crawley Council being able to finance on its own the kind of housing expansion required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important question is whether the council will have authority to take over land which is at present owned by the New Towns Commission and develop it for housing purposes, ignoring the very important aspect, which up to now has always been respected by the councils, that of security from noise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Every Member of the Committee has had some experience of the development not only of the nationalised industries but of statutory bodies which have now left the parliamentary embrace. I refer in particular to the British Airports Authority and its expansion of Gatwick Airport. Hon. Members will know that a statutory authority placed in that position can expand without any authority at all. Will this be the position in which the local authority will find itself? Will the authority be able to take housing land owned by the New Towns Commission and ignore all the sanctions which prevail in respect of aircraft noise? It is important to know whether that will be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
Another matter for concern is the extraordinary independence of statutory bodies. I am thinking in particular of the water authorities—the Southern Water Authority in my case. Other statutory bodies have a similar amount of independence. The other day a constituent of mine who lives in Cowfold, one of the most desirable places in my area, told me that he carries out an overseas business which requires much contact by telephone, but there is no automatic telephone facility in that area and he asked me to inquire if it was possible for him to he charged the rate available to those using automatic dialling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is now going rather wide of the amendment. Perhaps he will come a little closer to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hordern</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry to hear that. I was just drawing to a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituent was told by the Post Office that the cheaper rate for direct dialling was designed to encourage people to use it. He was told there was a waiting list of three years. That is an example of the way in which independent statutory bodies work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities are to be given powers which formally applied to the New Towns Commission and if power is to be obtained by the negative resolution procedure order, that will be a dangerous departure and one which we should examine carefully before allowing. I accept what my hon. Friend for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) said, that these powers should only be given through the affirmative resolution procedure order. The grants available under Sections 7 and 8 of the Industry Act are subject to affirmative resolution. They have to be reported to the House if the sums of money involved are in excess of £5 million. Schemes such as the accelerated project scheme have to be debated in the House if they involve sums over that figure. If that is the case for an affirmative resolution in respect of submissions under the Industry Act it is even more important that the extra powers taken by local authorities from the New Towns Commission and development corporations should also be subject to affirmative resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the contributions made by my hon. Friends the Members for Ludlow (Mr. More) and Horsham and Crawley (Mr. Hordern) and the way in which they pointed to the dangers in the procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister one particular question. I can envisage a situation where the Government, through the New Towns Commission, seek to help industry and to set aside large tracts of land for the development of industrial estates, perhaps to complement an older industry which is being phased out, or to help the employment situation. What happens if, after a transfer has been made, the local district council then appears to put pressure on the Secretary of State? Assuming the Secretary of State to be of the same political persuasion and to receive extensive representations from the local district council and county council, is there not a danger that the Secretary of State will give way, and, instead of land for industry and development continuing as such, it may be taken over by the local authority? That danger exists so long as we leave in the clause subsection 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot have it both ways. We listened to the Minister's remarks but we felt strongly that it was right to define more clearly paragraph (	<i>g</i>). Having listened to the Minister's argument for flexibility we accept that there is some merit in his argument, but if there is that flexibility in paragraph (	<i>g</i>) I do not believe that there is any case for subsection 4 as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and other hon. Members who joined the House in 1974 found it strange that the Government should often force through orders late at night. That is not a party political point. It took us some weeks or months to recognise that they were going through at all. Even now one has to be vigilant to ensure that such orders do not slip through without notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce Grocott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what we are paid for.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know, but we are all human. Such orders lapse at 11.30 p.m. and that causes problems. There might be protracted voting on an important Bill, resulting in the debate on an affirmative order being shortened still further, but the very least that is required is that there should be a debate, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
means that we must have the affirmative resolution procedure, although even that procedure leaves something to be desired. I hope that the Minister will take my points on board and view my hon. Friend's amendment sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has probably been one of the more interesting debates of this kind that I have either heard or participated in. It is always the right of Opposition to raise in Committee the question of negative and affirmative orders. I listened with interest and attention to the speeches by the hon. Members for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) Totnes (Mr. Mawby), Ludlow (Mr. More), Horsham and Crawley (Mr. Hordern) and Northampton, South (Mr. Morris). I have a great respect for the hon. Member for Ludlow, but I wondered where we were going when he told us that so far as he could see there is no difference between negative and affirmative orders and that they were both unsatisfactory. I thought at that stage that we were progressing well. I hope that I am not misinterpreting what he said, but that is what I understood to be his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have drawn attention to the hon. Member for Ludlow's speech because there might be misunderstanding about the drafting of the clause. It will not be necessary to make an order for every transfer scheme because the Bill, when it is enacted, will enable, in normal circumstances, a transfer to take place without an order. That will normally be right, but, as the hon. Member for Northampton, South has said, the Government have written a degree of flexibility into the Bill. Paragraph (	<i>g</i>) has been deliberately drafted to cover some exceptional or extraordinary situation that might conceivably exist some years from now and which could not be dealt with otherwise in any way, other than by amending the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an illustration the Committee should imagine the following situation. A new town corporation and a district council are engaged in negotiations involving an asset, an interest or a liability, which they want to transfer. It is clear from legal advice that that interest, asset or liability does not seem to be covered under paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) to (	<i>f</i>). The Government are, therefore, asked to consider the matter to see if an order can be made. In those circumstances an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
order can be made. I shall quote the paragraph (	<i>g</i>) as part of my answer to the arguments made by the hon. Member for Northampton, South. It is clearly defined:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any property, rights, liabilities or obligations of the corporation prescribed by the Secretary of State by order as being of a description which it is appropriate in his opinion to transfer with any property, rights, liabilities or obligations mentioned in any of the foregoing paragraphs."</p></blockquote>
My reading of that should have made clear that paragraph (	<i>g</i>) is designed to cover any items which are exceptional and which need to be transferred, and that such a long stop is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government chose the negative resolution procedure for this reason. A district council and new town corporation have agreed. They know what it is that they want to transfer, they approach the Secretary of State, who pays an order. If that is an affirmative resolution order it must go before the House. But, say hon. Members, it is possible that the House will not be sitting at that time, or that the pressure of business will be too great, and that, as a Labour Government, we produce much legislation, and that that means that affirmative orders sometimes cannot be considered early enough. Even though the district council, the new town corporation and Secretary of State are agreed that the transfer scheme should go ahead, it might be held up if an affirmative resolution procedure were demanded under statute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation will not happen for some years, and the Government do not foresee that this procedure will be needed often, but there may be some exceptional circumstances which will make it necessary in a few years' time. The Government have deliberately put down the subsections in order to provide a degree of flexibility. Amendment No. 8 was proposed and made in order to broaden the clause a little, so that it could cover another eventuality that civil servants felt might arise. Still, there is always, some years ahead, the possibility of a situation arising which might require an order. There would have been a hue and cry on the other side if the Government had drafted paragraph (	<i>g</i>) to read that the Secretary of State may transfer any
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
other item that occurs to him from time to time. The Secretary of State is required in such circumstances to use the negative procedure, and, I believe, rightly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is always pointed out by Governments when this kind of situation arises, there are precedents. I quote only one of them. In the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, a measure introduced by the party opposite, Section 67 re-enacts a provision of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, and empowers the Secretary of State to prescribe by regulations the classes of industrial buildings which are to be subject to IDC control. That is quite a large area of responsibility that the Secretary of State can exercise by means of negative order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept a lot of what has been said on the other side. Many of us, Back Benchers and Ministers, are worried about some aspects of the procedures of the House of Commons. The hon. Member for Ludlow mentioned the European Parliament. A short time ago I ceased to be a member of that Parliament, and I can assure him that the way in which this Parliament operates, and the kinds of checks the average Back Bencher has over Ministers, are absolute heaven compared with the situation in the European Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister—speaking, I thought, to Amendment No. 16—used the words "quite rightly so". Does that mean that he will accept Amendment No. 16 but is seeking to resist Amendment No. 15?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is "No". In using the words "quite rightly so" I was in effect saying that, if we have the order procedure, the amendment proposed by hon. Gentlemen opposite is merely consequential.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was arguing that the power the Government are seeking here is not acceptable in the present form, because it seems to us that the order would produce a continuation of the Act rather than a genuine delegated power in the normal sense. In other words, the order would, as it were, produce a new paragraph (	<i>g</i>) or (	<i>f</i>), rather than something which would hinge upon what is here already. Normally, delegated legislation is what the phrase implies. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
believe that we need an affirmative resolution, because otherwise what will happen is that a new paragraph will simply be tacked on to the Act, but through the order procedure rather than through an amendment to the Act. It is for that reason, as well as the general importance of the power and the other considerations put forward, that we believe there is a very powerful case in this instance for the affirmative resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mawby</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his reply to the points we have been making. However, there are one or two gaps to which I must draw his attention. He has been quoting an example where agreement has been reached between a district council and a new town corporation, and pointed out that only at that point will the Minister proceed by order. There is nothing in the Bill which makes certain that that agreement will happen before the Minister proceeds by order. There is no requirement that there shall be agreement. In addition, there appears to be no provision for the injured party, or the party that disagrees, to go to any form of arbitration other than to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this is an important matter. We would naturally accept the point that in most circumstances the Minister would only proceed after he had been approached by the two parties who had reached agreement, but there is nothing to prevent a Minister in the future from proceeding without necessarily having the agreement of both parties. This is one of the first points we have to make. There may be circumstances in which the Minister may proceed without necessarily having the agreement of those parties. An application by one or other of the parties would, I believe, need some debate and discussion so that we might satisfy ourselves that the Minister is acting properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman assured us, in referring to paragraph (	<i>g</i>), that the Secretary of State will only prescribe by order where it is felt "appropriate in his opinion" to do so. These are the words that matter—"in his opinion"—because there is no provision for anyone to challenge his opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
The very same power will be available to any Secretary of State, whoever he may be, in the future, however biased he may be, and whatever the Government of which he is part. We are giving these general powers to all Ministers in the future. I am sure that the present encumbent would not seek to ride roughshod over the rights of citizens, but we have to protect those rights. The only way we can do this is by making certain that Back Benchers, of whatever party, still have all the rights which are essential to them in making certain that no Minister in the future can ride roughshod over the citizens of this country. This is what Parliament is all about. I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his reply, but I hope he will take these riders into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Minister quite appreciated the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. More). My hon. Friend said that he and I and, I think, a lot of other Back Benchers do not like either the affirmative or the negative form of resolution, because we believe that Parliament ought to get down to the nitty-gritty and write into a Bill what may be required. Parliament should not proceed to an order unless it is absolutely essential. But my hon. Friend made the point that the affirmative order is the lesser of two evils. I agree with him. For these reasons, will the Minister, even at this late hour, not consider that it would be better, if we have to proceed by order, to do it by affirmative rather than negative resolution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman, in his heart of hearts, would like to give way, but that his brief says "No". There are occasions when the Member for Northampton, North (Mrs. Colquhoun) and I have combined to have a go at the Establishment somewhere along the line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Maureen Colquhoun</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only when I am ill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We might find even more common ground. There could be a case in which an order had been made for Northampton concerning transfer, and where a change was felt to be necessary. One of the great values of our function
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
in the House is that we act as the wicketkeeper or the long stop. The hon. Lady and I, if we felt the order to be wrong, would have the opportunity to stand up in the Chamber and tell the Government of the day, of whatever party they might be, that they had got it wrong and ought to take it back and have another look at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of the affirmative resolution is that it gives hon. Members, who know the situation on the ground in detail, the opportunity to point out to the Minister that he has been whitewashed by the officials. This is a very valuable safeguard. It is not a party political one. It is there so that the individual Back Bencher can look after the interests of his constituents. It would be a great shame if the hon. Gentleman did not mark his arrival in a position of responsibility by standing up for what, I am sure, he knows in his heart of hearts is absolutely right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) wanted to know whether the making of orders under paragraph (	<i>g</i>) would lead in the future to further subsections appearing in the Act. I think we all know that that is not likely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has misinterpreted what I said. I was arguing that the orders would be additional subsections of the Act. By their nature these orders are not true delegated legislation. They will be additional bits of the Bill, being stuck on, as it were, through orders. This seems to me to imply that they have a greater importance than many things, which are normally treated as in orders, tend to have. That is one of the reasons why we feel that they should be made by affirmative rather than by negative resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I genuinely misunderstood what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I can best proceed by assuring the Committee once again that we are dealing with a fairly tightly drawn situation. The hon. Member for Totnes (Mr. Mawby) laid emphasis on the words "in the Secretary of State's opinion". Perhaps I can persuade him by going back to the beginning of the clause, which explains what the Bill is designed to do. It is designed to provide for the transfer
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
from a new town corporation to a district council of certain very clearly defined assets—dwellings and any of their associated property, rights and liabilities. The clause goes some way, I feel, towards reassuring the hon. Member for Horsham and Crawley (Mr. Hordern)—who is temporarily not with us—that it is in that sense tightly drawn. I think that needs to be underlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unlikely to be used much. As has been admitted on this side of the Committee, the clause is drawn fairly flexibly in such a way as to cover most of the eventualities. The order provision is there to deal with the odd, exceptional and unforeseen circumstance which could have the consequence of holding up a transfer. I do not foresee many orders being made under this provision. It is designed to cope with the kind of legal muddle or hindrance which might arise at some stage in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Totnes suggested that the Minister would be making orders regardless of whether there had been agreements, or that the Minister might try to overrule the new town corporation and the district council. I have not had time to consider or imagine this sort of circumstance arising, but it is the most unlikely possibility with which we could be presented. The more I think of it the more I am sure that it would not be the intention of the present Secretary of State, or of any future Secretary of State finding himself in the same position. The whole tenor of the Bill is to try to find agreement. As we deal with later clauses we shall see that schemes are to be drawn up and that discussions are to take place between the new town corporation and the district council, and they may or may not come to an agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State may wish to approve a scheme, but be unable to do so because there is a tiny, exceptional circumstance which may exist in the middle of the 1980s. Unless the difficulty can be dealt with by a negative resolution and, therefore, with reasonable speed, there is a danger of the whole scheme being held up with debates in both Houses and consequent unnecessary delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unreasonable to suggest that the rights of hon. Members are being seriously
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
interfered with. With the way this legislation is drafted I cannot foresee a situation in which the Secretary of State would attempt to make an order in defiance of one of the parties in a transfer scheme. Fancy trying to impose a scheme on a district council! I do not know how it could be done. The order would have to be presented to the House and would have to include an exceptional circumstance related to paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>f</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think these circumstances will arise. Some of the dangers suggested by the Opposition have been exaggerated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am grateful to the Under-Secretary for his clarification of the rent office issue which I raised on Tuesday.

	<p>	<i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>gave us some degree of reassurance that we are not talking about the possibility of using white land, and gave assurances on certain other worries being felt in new towns. I thank him for the trouble he has taken, but there is still the outstanding problem of infill sites on which we shall expect some clarification. I understand the Minister is to write to his hon.

	<p>Another worry of mine concerns the point raised by the hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins). I have done a little work and made a couple of phone calls between our debates in Committee, and there is clear evidence that families uprooted from London or Birmingham—my experience is with London—often come from appalling conditions. They have a choice of new towns and their decision is often made in the light of what they expect to find there and on what the fairly glossy documentation they receive indicates will happen.</p>
	<p>One major worry which was vaguely voiced on Tuesday concerns young couples who move to the new towns first and whose parents tend to follow them later. If a commitment is published indicating that there will be facilities for old people, though they may not be provided immediately because they are not

immediately necessary, we must ensure that the commitment is carried out. Otherwise it would be grossly unfair to people moving into the new towns. I am not sure how this can be allied with the question of local democracy. Perhaps we can deal with the matter in Clause 10, but I hope the Government will turn their attention to the matter.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the gratitude of my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) to the Under-Secretary for his attempts to define matters in this clause more clearly and for his promise to review some of the wording to ensure that it is consistent. However, I ask the Minister to look again at some matters which were raised on Tuesday which I have been able to consider at rather greater length.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention again to the definition of the interests to be transferred. I do not recall any discussion about leasehold interests. In Redditch, houses sold to the so-called owner-occupiers are in fact on a long lease basis. I believe there are rights for leaseholders to obtain freehold, but I want to ensure that their rights will not be diminished by the transfers proposed in the clause. The Minister said on Second Reading that this matter was to be considered further. I am asking what further consideration has been given and whether it will extend to the people I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also concerned about the question of planning control and the development of associated areas, particularly infill sites and open spaces. We had a lengthy discussion on this matter on Tuesday, but I do not recall a reply from the Minister. Can he tell us what safeguards there are to be for national objectives, as opposed to local wishes and what a local authority may wish to do with parcels of land?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a hypothetical problem. One of the objectives of the Redditch new town was to provide for Birmingham overspill. This did not meet with much approval among the inhabitants of Red-ditch, but it remains part of the national objective and has been referred to in successive plans and studies by the West Midlands Planning Authorities' Conference. I have written to the Minister on several occasions asking whether he was able to make a decision on the future
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
size of Redditch. The assumptions on which the conference proceeded have not been borne out by subsequent events, and this is a matter which the Minister will have to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National objectives are also involved in the question of bringing industries to new towns. One of the attractions of new towns is that key workers can be accommodated. However, Redditch has been unable to attract much industry from the West Midlands conurbation and members of the corporation have recently had to visit Japan in an attempt to attract new industrial investment. When a new Leyland plant was originally projected for Redditch it was suggested that additional housing would not be necessary because many of the people of Redditch already commuted to Longbridge and Leyland workers from other areas could easily find their way to Redditch. It is vital that assurances can be given that housing will be available if new town corporations are to attract industry from other parts of the country and from other countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is in direct conflict with the local authority which is concerned about its own housing waiting lists, quite naturally. In my own advice bureau every Saturday I have the most tragic cases. There is a conflict here. It is not clear to me from the Under-Secretary's remarks that this has been fully hoisted on board, as to what arrangements are to be retained to ensure that these objectives are complied with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a somewhat emotional discussion about the authoritarian or democratic nature of local authorities and development corporations. It seemed to be based on a highly theoretical level. The Minister himself, in his remarks at Second Reading, was claiming that it was easier for tenants to know about a town once the housing authorities were amalgamated. Any hon. Member must have had experience of the virtual impossibility of trying to arrange an exchange in respect of a local authority housing area and the complete lack of response of housing officials to ordinary and reasonable requests from members of the public in this regard. I am certain this experience is widely shared. I have found that new town corporations have been much more responsive to tenant's wishes in this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
respect, and they have also done a great deal more by way of the development of residents' associations, and have carried out a great deal more supportive work by means of social development offices and other social workers than have the neighbouring local authorities. The case is by no means proved that just because a local councillor is on the scene there is more participatory or democratic handling of the issues which affect people's everyday lives. I think it was right to get that on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not just a political point but a real and practical one, as when we consider the management and the development of open spaces associated with housing which are assets to be transferred under this Bill. It is, for instance, the case that, whereas the New Town Corporation of Redditch allows loal residents' associations to develop social clubs and even playing fields for residents, that is not the policy of the local authority. In the new town areas the residents, with a great deal of self-help and participation and other virtuous sentiments of which Members of the other side would approve, have raised money and developed facilities for the benefit of all the residents in those areas. In other parts of the town run by the local authority there is a complete block on such developments, and the Minister himself had recently to resolve an appeal against a local authority in favour of a new town residents' association over the erection of a social club. So please let us discuss these issues on a practical basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will be able to give us some assurance that these points will be considered carefully. They are of real validity, and we shall have cause to revert to them when we discuss proposals that corporations consult all new town residents before any transfer is effected. I am looking to an imaginative response to the Under-Secretary to what—as I hope I have shown them to be in as flat a way as possible—are real practical points of great significance for new towns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular I would stress again the point about incoming industry. It is not just a question of nomination rights but of making certain that houses will be available and that the infilling spaces kept for that purpose are not developed and put to other uses by the local autho-
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
rity. There is the whole question of the planning control and the development of areas taken over by the local authority. There is this need to provide for incoming industry and also a commitment to original tenants that there would be facilities for their children to be housed. I think it was the hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins), or perhaps the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms. Colquhoun), who was talking about the need for the local authority to be able to house its own people in any part of the town. I realise this has to come over a period. The fact remains that the tenants going to these new towns were given the assurance that the second-generation families would be housed. It is the policy of the corporation at the moment that the children of residents of the new town can be housed. This is liable to be changed under the transfer arrangements. I do not think that point was sufficiently ventilated in our discussions on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Red-ditch (Mr. Miller) I want to emphasise the point made by my hon. Friends that this question of local democracy is an important one. After all, the question of the responsiveness of the corporation depends largely on the corporation. It is not compelled to communicate, but the democratic machinery does exist in the local authorities. My own new town, Central Lancashire New Town, is so unresponsive that within the last three or four weeks every local authority—and there are many, because it is probably the biggest of all the designated new towns—has complained about the authoritarian attitude of that town corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member not agree that he must have received large numbers of complaints about the authoritarian attitude of his own local authority? This is a common experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. I have made some myself. The point is that the democratic remedy is there. People have the opportunity of using it, but they do not have it in Central Lancashire New Town. We have a liaison committee on which there are one or two councillors called elected representatives but who are not representing the council. When one such person was questioned in the Preston
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
District Council Chamber he said he was pledged to secrecy. That shows how unresponsive they are. Protest organisations throughout the area are continually reiterating the point that the new town corporation is unresponsive. Most of these are from Conservative areas. In the district authority we have the democratic machinery. People can press their councillors, and often influence them into changing policies, especially on planning, in the new town area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us remember that there is a great deal of resentment against newcomers when they come into a new town. Even if they had no advantages there would be resentment, because there is a natural suspicion of all strangers. I lived in an East Anglian country town for 15 years or more, and I am still regarded there as a stranger, and I did not go in with any privileges at all. If one takes Preston alone, we have a housing waiting list of 2,600 families. They are not allowed new town houses, whereas people can come in from outside. Fair enough. That is the situation. We have to accept it. What we cannot accept is that once the local authorities take over the responsibilities as well as the assets from the new town corporation they cannot go on treating two different sections of the community differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is their object, if they are worth their salt, to weld the two communities together. It is true that when leasehold commitments have been made they should be honoured, but to attempt to prolong the differences in treatment between the two groups is the easiest way to make those groups fight each other. Our prime object in handing over the responsibilities and assets of the new town corporation to the local authority is to create a new community. It is difficult anyway, but if one continues to treat two sections of the community differently that task will become impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the further point about infilling, and, perhaps, new attitudes to the planning and developing of new pieces of land, and the need, as hon. Members opposite have said, to follow national directives. It should be remembered that the people who know these plots of land best are the people who live around them and the people who represent them.
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
One might start off with a grandiose scheme for a lovely open space between houses, and that should remain an open space for ever according to the national directive, but those who have some experience of some of these estates know what happens. They frequently become dumping grounds; they frequently have vandals running wild. Those of us who have served on local authorities know from experience that sometimes the only way to deal with this is to change the use—either for houses, even if it is a sparse development with some plots in between, or for allotments, or even a playground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities, more than the authority in Westminster, are the best people to decide. Let us remember that it is our object to make local authorities planning authorities because they are best able to understand the planning needs of the district. Moreover, quite a lot was said in the debate last night in the House about the need for independence—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Member's remarks about the need to treat local authorities as responsible bodies, but the fact remains that the master plan for a new town has often been the subject of a public inquiry and has been determined in that way. Therefore it would be wrong subsequently to modify that without some effective process for monitoring any such change and allowing the public to participate in any such change of the plan and to voice their objections. I can well conceive that most of the residents affected might well object to the proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member that master plans should not be changed. We are talking about the master plan not little tiny pieces. In any case I would have thought the hon. Member would agree that no plan once established will ever be altered. As a matter of fact corporations do plan to make changes themselves. My own corporation has done so many times in the last two years. It is always changing them. Look at the difference between Buchanan and today, in attitudes on planning and how new towns should be built. The hon. Gentleman certainly does not suggest that because a plan has been made it should become stereotyped for all time?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want to create effective local democracy in the localities the local authorities have to have as much independence as possible. Hon. Gentlemen last night complained that the Government's attitude is too authoritarian. We are saying that the local authorities should be given the independence, especially in planning, to modify a plan to suit local needs and to suit the wishes of the local people, in the interest of creating a happy, united community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joseph Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An important point has already been raised this morning regarding second generation residents in a town having priority to be rehoused in the original new town area. Let us put the argument the other way. Is the hon. Member saying they ought to have the priority to be rehoused within the original new town area or sphere of activity, and also have the double privilege of having the availability of the normal waiting list? This is just not on. I could see very serious friction arising if it were attempted with, for instance, the son or daughter of a resident in a new town who did not want to live in a new town area but, for social or employment reasons, wanted to be rehoused in another part of the district, in the old housing stock, and he or she were given a house from that waiting list while also retaining the privilege of being rehoused in the original new town. It would, as my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) said, create a divided community. This would be the most disastrous aspect of this Bill. I hope there is no attempt made to retain or introduce that type of privilege. It would create a very special privilege for a section of the community. They would be bitterly rejected by the rest of the community when the manifestations of the privilege became apparent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will resist the temptation to pursue that matter. It has been well aired. I return to the nature of the property, rights, liabilities and obligations which have formed the basis of the greater part of our discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have been conscious of the possibility that some right or liability not covered by the terms of the clause might
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
come to light at a later stage. I am satisfied that the clause covers any eventuality, particularly in the light of the explanations and assurances given by my right hon. Friend on Tuesday and my hon. Friend today. We have the possibility in the clause of making an order to deal with any issue which is not covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is considerable concern outside the House that we should deal with all rights. The question of nomination rights, to which the hon. Member for Bromsgrove arid Redditch (Mr. Miller) referred, is extremely important. I am quite sure the local authorities will take these over and deal with them as effectively as the development corporations have, bearing in mind that such local authorities will at various times be of different political complexions. I am sure hon. Members on both sides will at some time be in disagreement with the way in which those rights are exercised, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Preston North (Mr. Atkins) has emphasised, the electorate always has the opportunity to turn out the local authority and to elect another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one matter on which I would seek an answer from my hon. Friend. That is the question of the rights which development corporations or the commission have in certain cases to nominate tenants to housing association dwellings. I believe this right exists in certain areas. I have scrutinised the clause carefully and I assume this right will also be transferred. I see no reason why local authorities should not be capable of exercising such rights if we agree that they can exercise all the other rights covered by this clause. Nonetheless, I would like my hon. Friend to refer to this matter in his reply. He will recall that there is also another matter on which he has undertaken to communicate with me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are grateful for the trouble my hon. Friend has taken to reassure the Committee on all these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate, with a number of points concentrating on the issue of nomination rights. In clause 3(4)(	<i>b</i>) the question of nomination is covered as part of a transfer scheme. I do not want, therefore, to go into this in detail. It
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
will clearly be part of a transfer scheme where it is seen to be advisable because the new town corporation has responsibilities to fulfil in terms of housing people in the area, or housing some of the categories which have been mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to enter into discussion on the issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean), but I take the point he is making. It is a valid one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to dwell on the matter raised by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) regarding the housing of key workers. This is a very important point, and I was immediately reminded of the fact that, though my own local authority has a housing waiting list of some 6,000 or 7,000 people, it is considering the housing of the workers. A housing authority coping with a considerable amount of housing stress and under colossal pressure by the electorate to provide housing for people who live in the areas, an Inner London borough, at the same time is concerned about the degree to which an authority has a responsibility to industry for the long-term prosperity of the town and from time to time to make housing available where industry needs the assistance of a key worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true that as soon as the responsibility is transferred to a. district council the only people they will ever house are those who happen to live within the borders of the district. Anyone who suggests that does not show very much faith in local government. We want to hand over this responsibility in the faith that these local authorities will carry on many of the traditions and responsibilities of the new town corporations, whether or not they are written into the scheme and agreement, and are laid down in certain nomination rights, which the new town corporations continue to have for some time after the transfer scheme has been brought into operation. I would emphasise that a local authority still has the statutory duty, under the Housing Act 1957, to look after the housing needs of the people in its area, and must do so with local democracy in mind. That is another example of the degree to which the local authority has a responsibility beyond its immediate borders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
The subject of elderly workers has been rightly raised. For some time to come the new town corporation will have these responsibilities and rights to nominate. I do not see any great difficulty about that so far as the elderly are concerned. I imagine that in most cases these will be relations of residents already living in the district council area itself, in the new town. It will not, therefore, be an unpopular but a popular move to enable families already settled in new towns to bring their elderly relations to come to join them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope there is no major point that I have omitted. I have deliberately not entered into a debate on many of the arguments, which were very well put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) raised the matter whether a new town corporation would have the right to nominate to housing association dwellings. I am advised that that would not normally be part of a transfer scheme, though it would be possible for some kind of agreement to be worked out between a new town corporation, a district council and a housing association for some kind of nomination arrangement to be made with that housing association. I do not think it would normally find itself placed as part of a scheme. I can certainly seek further advice about that in order to answer my hon. Friend more precisely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend seek further advice on, this matter? An anomalous situation would be created if these rights were not transferred with other rights and were, for some reason, not covered. I hope the Minister will consider that, to see if the Bill should be further amended to make that possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I shall write to him, or raise it later in the Committee if our examination reveals matters which have not yet occurred to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever anxieties have been expressed all Members of the Committee are in basic agreement that we are taking the right step in transferring assets, liabilities and interests to district councils which are democratically elected. There are, of course, occasions when democratically
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
elected bodies take wrong decisions, but that is no argument for not taking this step. It is a natural step in the evolution of the new towns towards being fully fledged and developed. It would be illogical to discriminate for ever between new towns and long established towns where the people have full democratic rights. Inevitably, there will be occasions when local authorities take decisions with which hon. Members disagree, but, in the end, I am sure that it is right to see that a local authority is ultimately responsible because it is democratically elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONSULTATIONS WITH A VIEW TO TRANSFER SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 17, in page 3, line 16, leave out '15' and insert '18'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is exploratory and is designed to elicit what is in the Minister's mind in proposing a period of 15 years. I also want to raise a somewhat technical matter. It appears from the consultative document published in December 1974 that the object in proposing 15 years is to divide first and second generation new towns. Has consideration been given to the possibility of the extension of new towns and the date of designation of such extensions? Will the period of 15 years extend from the original date of designation or from the date of the extension of a part of a new town? I would be grateful if the Minister would share his thoughts with us on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) has moved his amendment. It provides me with an opportunity to explain why the period of 15 years was chosen. The hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about the extension of new towns, and I can tell him that it will be included within the terms of the original designation of the new town. The clause does no more than give the Secretary of
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
State a discretionary power. Where any of the conditions set out in subsection (2) are satisfied the Secretary of State can direct that consultations on the possibility of transfer should begin. We are talking about the beginning of consultations rather than the actual transfer. As a result of these consultations it might be realised, on one side or the other, that the time is not right for a transfer; therefore, no direction would be made for such a transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch said, paragraph (	<i>b</i>) separates first and second generation new towns, but I would be the first to admit that the length of time chosen is to some extent arbitrary. If all the hon. Gentleman was requesting was an explanation I hope that my few brief remarks will be satisfactory and that he will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation, but I must press him a little further because there are some new towns, such as that of Redditch, where expansions are currently being considered. Therefore the period of 15 years would not allow much time for the development of the extended part of the town. If such an expansion to Redditch were approved and the planning procedures completed, the 15 years might be at an end.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that if there were serious doubts about that expansion being the subject of a transfer scheme I hope that the town corporation, the district council and the Secretary of State would agree that there would be no case for carrying it through. The power under the clause is only discretionary to allow consultations to take place. The transfer of housing estates all at one go is not necessarily part of the way in which the Bill will operate. It might involve certain estates in Redditch by agreement locally, but if there were serious doubts about the advisability of certain transfers I hope they would not take place, or that they would be dealt with by way of management schemes. There are other methods to deal with areas which are not ready for full transfer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That further clarification is helpful and I do not wish to

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 18, in page 3, line 18, after 'State', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'with the agreement of the New Town Corporation'.</p></blockquote>
I welcome the possibilities under this subsection of the clause. It shows a flexible approach. There will be occasions before the 15 years are up where a case can be made for the transfer of property. Development in Northampton, for instance, is in two parts, and the first part is nearly finished. It is important, where an earlier transfer than normal is made, that it should be with the agreement of the new town corporation. In Northampton, for example, it comprises representatives from both major political parties and has its own local experts. If the new town corporation felt it wrong to have an early transfer because it had not finished development and the district council put political pressure on a sympathetic Minister, the Minister should seek agreement with the new town corporation. He should listen carefully to it, and, if no agreement is reached, he should tell the local authority that it will have to wait. It is for those reasons that we want a safeguard in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the reasons for the amendment and, at first sight, it makes sense that the new town corporation should be consulted. The hon. Gentleman has confirmed what I believed to be behind the amendment—that he has not sufficiently taken on board that we are dealing here with whether consultation should take place. I agree that the consent of the new town corporation should be obtained, but the right time to obtain that is during the consultations. It would be difficult to get agreement other than by studying the possibilities of transfer and the details involved. It is, therefore, at that stage, during consultations, that the agreement of the new town corporations and district councils should be sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of the amendment is that it would give to the new town corporations a veto on consultations ever taking place. I am sure that the Opposition would not want that. I am certain that they do not want to give non-democrati-

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 22 is of a slightly different nature. It is seeking to substitute the words "relevant district councils" for "council". It is a rather technical point, and I should be interested to hear whether it is a valid one or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that this clause has a quite sensible objective, in that a new town corporation and the relevant district council can enter into discussions to consider whether it is desirable that a transfer scheme should take place. It enables them to come together to discuss these matters.

But when we look at what is involved, we feel that the county has a quite legitimate stake and a quite relevant part to play in these considerations.

We all know that housing is a district council responsibility, but equally we know that in the world of local government there is and should be close linkage between the different forms of service. There is a strong view, perhaps particularly strongly held on the Labour side,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
that a unitary authority has a good deal to be said for it. I believe that some of my hon. Friends also think this. This is not the occasion for a general argument on the principles of local government, but it seems to me to make the point that there is a very close link between housing and the other relevant services, particularly as some of those relevant services have a very important impact on the size of the population. It is the size of the population that in the long run determines what will happen to the pattern of housing in a particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The services with which the county is primarily or solely concerned include roads and education, and the county has a big say in planning. The planning powers in local government are divided at the moment, not always completely easily, between county and district councils, but the county has a major say in the strategic planning of an area. I fully accept that we cannot make a hard and fast distinction between procedure planning, structure planning and the more routine or local level planning which goes on the whole time. When we are considering patterns of education and of housing, the two quite clearly have a lot of bearing on each other. It makes nonsense to rush ahead with the provision of housing without schools to match, or to have a surplus of schooling in relation to housing stock. The whole business of the physical planning, which is very much concerned with transport planning, should be quite intimately linked to the question of housing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we look at local government quite rightly in terms of its powers and duties, local authorities have a rather undefined but nevertheless real interest or concern with the whole of their area. Even though housing may be the responsibility solely of the district council, we have to recognise that a county council has some sort of concern with housing It may not have the actual job of providing housing, but housing is a very important part of our life today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose it is inherent in our philosophy of county councils, and of structure planning and so on, that the kind of ultimate concern with the shape of life in an area, inasmuch as it is a matter for local government to determine these things, partly rests with the county
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
council. It seems to me, therefore, that there is quite a strong logical case for allowing or requiring the county council to be brought into discussion about something which will have a quite signficant impact—this is the point of the legislation—on the lives of the people living in any particular area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the long run we are concerned with the balance of the population, but in the shorter term we are concerned with the very important relationship between education and the roads on the one hand, and planning overall on the other. I hope that the Minister will feel able to respond sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked me to respond sympathetically and I am bound to do so, because his points are very important ones. I hope they are points that the Government have taken fully on board in the drafting of the Bill. The hon. Gentleman is perfectly right to put down an amendment of this kind to draw attention to the need to protect the interests of county councils, and to make sure that the advice they might have to give, where a transfer scheme is being drawn up, is fully taken into account in relation to matters such as education, roads, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the amendment goes a little further than even its sponsors intended. It would have the effect of empowering a county council, within the designated area of a new town, to initiate consultations about a possible transfer if 15 years had passed since the designation of a new town. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman would think it would be appropriate for the county council to start consultations between the new town corporations and the district councils—and, indeed, the Secretary of State—and then to he fully involved in what the hon. Gentleman admitted was a matter of almost complete concern to the district council, namely, the transfer of housing assets and housing related assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not to say that I am not in full agreement with the hon. Gentleman that county councils ought to be involved. I think the hon. Gentleman has every right to expect me to say what we would propose to do about it. The answer is that the Government would, perfectly obviously, wish to issue full
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
guidance to the negotiating parties, that is, the new town corporation and the district council, to ensure that at every stage in their consultations—and obviously covering such other matters as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, such as education, transport and so on—the county council should be fully and properly consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be content with that explanation of what lies behind the drafting of the clause. I hope he feels that what I have said goes a good way towards satisfying him. I hope also that he would agree that it would not be right to write into the Bill a power for the county to initiate consultation on a matter which is of direct concern to a new town corporation and the district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the Under-Secretary has made it plain that there may be good reason why a county council should not be enabled to request the initiation of consultations, I draw his attention again to the need for the county council to be consulted. I should have thought it appropriate that there should be some provision in the Bill to ensure that consultation should take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to education and to the need to plan the school provision in line with the housing provision. In earlier remarks I have drawn some attention to the consequences of variations in the original master plan and the effect these could later have on education. My point concerns the extent to which there is dual use of schools, particularly in regard to sport and recreational facilities. This has a very real bearing on the transfer of housing-related assets, because of the use made of them and the negotiations which have taken place already between the corporation and the education authority—which is a county authority—over the use of the premises and some parts of the facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a very real problem here, quite apart from the planning need to dovetail the provisions. There have been some lamentable examples of failure in this respect in my constituency. The Minister may have come across representations about the current system, which has not so far been satisfactorily resolved, of financing roads as between county councils and corporations. This is perhaps straying a
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
bit far from the amendment, but it is a very relevant factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, concerning the need for county councils to be consulted, there are very real financial implications. There is, arising from the designations of new towns, a very real financial burden on county councils. Before the Under-Secretary's recent elevation there was an application to his Department making just this point in respect of the Redditch new town and the Droitwich expanded new town. I raised this on the Adjournment on the only occasion on which I have been fortunate in the Ballot. There is a very real need for consultation with the county councils. I feel that we need something specific here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joseph Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with interest to what was almost a plea from the other side that the counties, of whatever type they may be, should be given a sort of reserve power to initiate discussions or to become over-involved. The Government will have to watch this very carefully, in that, because of the mess made by the last local government reorganisation, there are some very large county authorities—I refer especially to the metropolitan counties—which have very little to do. I say that from my own experience. Some huge authorities have been created and they are still looking for a rôle, or an increase in rôle. In the way that the reorganisation was done, the services that were transferred to them were very limited indeed, and a never ending battle is taking place between district councils and metropolitan county councils, where they are at cross-purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us which new towns in the areas of metropolitan county councils he has in mind? He seems to be alarmed at the thought that they might interfere too much with new towns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dean</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am speaking in a general sense, because quite a lot of the new towns are in the metropolitan counties.
