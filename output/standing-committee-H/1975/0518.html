	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Environment (Mr. Guy Barnett)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like at this point to conclude my speech begun on Tuesday. So that my right hon. Friend may address the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Planning and Local Government (Mr. John Silkin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to apologise to you, Mr. Bonner Pink, and to the Committee for having to leave at 11 o'clock to attend the Cabinet. I should like to deal with the Opposition's amendment very briefly because of the time and because the Committee has had an interesting debate, which I have read.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will deal first with the earlier amendments rather than the main substantive amendment moved by the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris). His idea that the Secretary of State casually comes to a decision on whether to give a grant to a district council is a little tease. I looked at the word "casually" with great envy. Would that it were so. Unfortunately, it is not. Audited accounts and as much evidence as possible have to be submitted. This happens in the life of every Secretary of State, alas, together with the grim, forbidding further checking of figures at the Treasury, to see that he does not act as casually as the hon. Gentleman seems to think. The hon. Gentleman need be in no doubt. The matters which he wants the Secretary of State to look at have to be looked at in any event, and the evidence has to be supplied almost in the way he so eloquently put it in his speech.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>226</span>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reasonably satisfied about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move to the main amendment. What worried the hon. Gentleman—how unanimous Northampton is on this occasion and my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms. Colquhoun), was the discretionary power of the Secretary of State. The power has to be discretionary if he is to look at all the facts and figures. At some stage the Secretary of State has to make up his mind. That means that he has to exercise a discretion. In these days of cybernetics, until we can have an august computer acting as Secretary of State—and something will go wrong with the computer as it usually does—the Secretary of State has to exercise some degree of discretion in seeing that the facts are properly put to him and the result properly arrived at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are difficulties even in the hon. Gentleman's wording. I am not making what I always think is a bad point, that the amendment is defective. I do not believe that it is defective—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) fairly pointed out, we have the draftsmen and should be able to put it right. That is not the difficulty. The difficulty is that it is almost impossible to find wording which does not make the power discretionary. The amendment appears to abolish the discretionary function and make it automatic, but it does not. The amendment would make the clause read as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it appears or is proved to the Secretary of State …"</p></blockquote>
At that stage the Secretary of State has to say either "You have proved it to me" or "You have not proved it to me". There is no way round that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to come firmly to grips with this point, which is very important. I do not want to burke it. How are we to deal with the financial situation which will arise on transfer? At present, Section 42 applies to new towns and, broadly speaking, the transferred housing will be in balance when it goes over to the local authority. What happens then? The basis we wish to secure is that there shall be no burden, no increased burden, no undue burden, upon the local authority. It is right for me to tell the Committee how I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
envisage that we shall get to that desirable situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great difference between our approach to the first generation new towns and our approach to the later new towns. I am guessing here, but when the accounts of the first generation new towns are audited and put to the Secretary of State a decision can be easily arrived at. It is possible that some new towns might be gainers even if there were no direct grant from the Secretary of State. That is possible. It depends on the age of the original houses and the stock of the district council. I do not want to mention specific new towns which I think might be in that position. Were I to do so I should be pre-empting examination of the accounts to see whether they balance. My belief is that at least one new town would be in that position. My hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn and Hatfield (Mrs. Hayman) will be delighted to hear that I am including the Commission for the New Towns as well. The range of assistance we shall give to them will allow a period of between one to five years. After that there would be no burden upon them, other than the normal burden that any local authority would have. In other words, they would have assimilated the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the later new towns. The hon. Member for Northampton, South, apart from wishing to probe the point generally, has in mind his own new town. I cannot think how we could put wording in the Bill to protect the position that is likely to arise in the later new towns many years hence. There are many reasons for that. We do not know what building costs and rent levels will be, and any wording that is put into the Bill now will be guesswork. It might turn out to be far too rigid. I should, therefore, much prefer to look upon the burden at the time, with the accounts fully before us, and do everything I can to meet that burden. The time envisaged is too far ahead to be dealt with now, and it certainly cannot be dealt with by the wording of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman and I are both out to help the district council at the moment of transfer. If there is a semantic difference between us it is that my basis is that there shall be a transitional period during which, so long as it is necessary, there shall be a meeting of the burden, increased burden, or undue bur-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
den, by a grant. Unfortunately, the wording of the amendment makes that virtually permanent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will give an example. My argument is somewhat hypothetical but it will appeal to both my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North and the hon. Member for Northampton, South. Suppose that, as a result of the policies and influence of the hon. Member for Northampton, South, the average rent of district council houses in Northampton were radically reduced to 1p a week. I can almost see the hon. Gentleman advocating this splendid drop in the rents of district council houses. Suppose that reduction took place one week before a transfer scheme were mooted. Bringing up the rents in Northampton to where they were before the 1p a week would represent a burden upon the local authority. Furthermore, that burden would have to be met permanently. The whole basis of the amendment is to take the moment of transfer and ask whether there is a burden then. There would be, in the ridiculous instance I have quoted. That is the starting point, and it remains with us for all time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stanley Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will be aware of an amendment in my name to leave out "undue" and insert "increased"—a word he used a little earlier on. The amendment was ruled out of order and, with my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Ms. Colquhoun), I was seriously considering whether to support the amendment which is before the Committee. If my right hon. Friend will give an undertaking to produce an amendment to delete "undue", so that it becomes clear that, where an increased burden is imposed, there is the possibility of doing something about it, and that something will be done, I shall be anxious to look again at the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting suggestion. There is little difference in principle between us. I was not terribly happy about "undue", perhaps not for the reason given by my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) but because it can mean many things to many people. If it would help the Committee, should be prepared to look again at this matter between now and Report to see whether I can find a tighter wording. Several possibilities float through the mind. My hon. Friend suggested "increased".
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
Perhaps the word should be dropped altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Helene Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of my hon. Friends and I were worried that the phraseology "undue burden" implied that there would be a due burden which could fall on a local authority. I accept the idiocy of the situation outlined by my right hon. Friend of the 1p a week rent, and the need for a fallback in the case of the total aberration of a district council, but we are concerned that tenants and ratepayers will suffer this mythical "due" burden, which seems to be implied by the phraseology. We should be grateful if my right hon. Friend would look at the phraseology to see whether he can reassure us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has proved to me the thought that has been going through my mind through the years, that women are far more logical than men. I must admit that I had not looked at the positive side of "undue" and considered what a "due" burden might be. It might be helpful for me to see whether there is a way of dealing with the phrase "undue burden". It is difficult to get the exact words we want. I should like to take this back and have a look at it before Report, to see whether I can do anything that will meet what is clearly the general wish of the Committee and my own wish. I do not know whether I shall be able to do it, but I will do my best. At least, if I were to fail to do it, hon. Members on either side are free to consider it again when we get to Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One thing the Committee is agreed upon is that there is a due measure of concern about the meaning of the word "undue". At least we have harmony on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It probably does not make any difference what word one puts in. What really matters in this sub-section is what the Secretary of State thinks. One of the features of the British way of doing things is that we give the most fantastic power to Secretaries of State and have no courts to determine whether they are behaving themselves or not. It does not matter, except perhaps morally, whether one has in the word "undue" or not. It is the Secretary's of States decision that will determine the matter. As we know, Secretaries of State can behave in a wilful way. Ministers can interpret the law in a wilful way as we have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
just seen with the so-called Minister of Sport preventing, on the flimsiest of grounds, Rhodesian cricketers from coming here. But that is not the subject of discussion here and now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been a rather important debate because it has given the Committee a chance to reflect on the real anxieties felt in the new town local authorities. We have on both sides here people speaking from direct local knowledge, and very properly they have put the point of view of those local authorities. They have expressed the views cogently and to good effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to recognise that there is a measure of uncertainty about the way in which the Bill is drafted at the moment. I know it is difficult to get it right, and I sympathise with the Government in this. It seems to most of us, looking at the Bill, that one does not know exactly what is going to happen. This is a reflection on this principle of flexibility which the Minister is always enunciating. It is a reflection of the fact that the Minister wants to see how things turn out and then make appropriate decisions. Inevitably people will be worried in the new town areas at the relative vagueness of this legislation. A number of outside bodies have commented on this clause and expressed the same sort of anxiety as we have heard today. I will not quote at length, but one particular comment, which has a bearing on something the Minister said, came from the Town and County Planning Association, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Here is the danger of the financial burden falling very unequally among the local authorities concerned. Housing built by the early new towns stands in to those corporations and the Commission at a very low book value, and very low fixed interest rates—3 per cent. to 4 per cent.—are being paid on loans. Housing built more recently has been more expensive to build and the borrowing has also been much more expensive, with interest rates up to 15 per cent. Thus the transfer of housing built by a new town in recent years, mainly in the second and third generations new towns, will be a far greater financial burden to the local authorities taking it over."</p></blockquote>
This is what the Minister acknowledges. It is right to get it firmly on the record. There is a real fear of heavy burdens falling on some of the new towns. It can be illustrated by the fact that, in the new towns as they stand, the proportion of the burden of providing housing borne by the rent payers is much
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
lower than the proportion borne normally in the local authorities. Some 25 per cent. in the new towns comes out of rents. The remainder comes out of the subsidy. For housing overall the figure is, I think, somewhere between 43 per cent. and 55 per cent., depending on whether one includes rebates or not. Therefore the burden borne by central Government in the new towns is much greater, two or three times as great, as it is in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to make sure that the assurances which this Bill is designed to contain are absolutely valid, and this is the reason for our set of amendments. On the other hand the Under-Secretary was right to say, when he discussed this, that there is somebody else who has an interest in this matter and that somebody else is the taxpayer. Some of my hon. Friends feel this strongly, others less so. The Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not think it is unfair to introduce this question of the consideration of the taxpayers" interest".</p></blockquote>
He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, I think the Committee will agree that it would not be reasonable to ask the taxpayer to be financially responsible if the calculation of the size of the burden were to be based on the wholly unreasonable policies of a district council."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 13th May 1976; c. 222–3.]</p></blockquote>
We have heard echoes of that comment this morning, and it is a point which we have to consider seriously. I have great sympathy with the arguments put forward by the representatives of the new towns. We have to consider carefully the exact implications of this set of amendments. It is one of the facts that there are areas in this country where the local authorities, normally Socialist, are pursuing a rent policy aimed at keeping rents to an extremely low level. Some of them are defying the implied wishes of the present Government. I have had quoted to me one example. Sedgefield District Council has apparently a substantial differential in the rents it raises as compared with those of the Aycliffe Development Corporation. This is an example which can be, and, no doubt, is being, repeated in different parts of the country. One is entitled to ask what would happen in those areas if housing were transferred from the development
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
corporations to local authorities who were hell bent on keeping rents at an excessively low level, and what, as a consequence of this, would be the burden on the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it be inherent and implicit in the amendments we have put forward that the cost of subsidising the low rents of the houses transferred would fall on the taxpayer? I am concerned that this might be the case. It would be intolerable that the taxpayer should be saddled with this kind of burden in this kind of situation. One of the difficulties about the business of transferring housing assets to local authorities will be the question how they will deal with the situation where there are different levels of rent between the development corporations houses and their own houses. This will pose a real managerial problem. I think that if local authorities take the view that their sole job is to keep rents down to an artificially low level this will be damaging. It seems to me one of the risks of the amendments we are putting forward that this could happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question therefore is: what is the right course for the Committee to take at the present time? I have carefully thought about the arguments put forward. They are arguments to which it will be proper to return when on Report. Even though one accepts part of what the Minister has said, as I do, nevertheless there is still a degree of anxiety whether we can be sure that the councils will get a really fair deal out of the Governent. The Minister has given the Committee an assurance on this point and I do not dispute his intentions. I think he is quite genuinely keen to make sure that the local authorities get a fair deal. There are real problems about planning for every contingency, foreseen or unforeseen. This is one of the areas where there is some case for the Minister having a little bit of discretion up his sleeve, reluctant though I am normally to give him discretion because I am not sure what he would do with it. In this case there is some reason for allowing discretion. My advice to the Committee is not to press the amendment today, but to make clear that this is something we are likely to come back to on Report when the Government themselves will have had time to think further about it,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
and may be we can then see whether we can take the thing a bit further and give more assurance to the local authorities who are concerned about this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the speeches from the right hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend it would be a little churlish if one were to press too far this morning, but before I ask to withdraw the amendment, as I intend to, I should put on record a summary of what we are saying to the Minister for when he is reconsidering the wording of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister now recognises that there is a genuine worry, particularly in the second and third generation new towns, and possibly the odd first generation town. If there had been a referendum in some of these second generation towns on whether they would like to be new towns I suspect that the answer would have been a rejection. That is not a party political point. It is a reflection of the thinking of local communities who would have preferred to have remained undisturbed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally true, and this is very much due to the success of this policy, that these new towns, once they have been designated, have by and large been extremely successful. That is greatly to the credit both of the receiving authorities in managing the new towns and of the Minister, whoever he may have been at the particular time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I used to think, perhaps in my innocence, that were something "proved" to a Minister or a Government, of either party, there would be a response; but the longer one is in politics the more one learns that there are pressures and counter-pressures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Silkin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I once heard Sir Stafford Cripps, among a small circle of friends, prove that black was white.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am particularly thinking in this case of the rate support grant. I think hon. Members on both sides have demonstrated to the Government that new towns have by necessity a younger population, and a younger population, by necessity, has more children. Regretfully, despite pressure from both sides, we have not reached the happy stage where the rate support grant negotiations anticipate the year's population to which the grant applies. Therefore, there is a burden which is not reflected in benefits to the local community. I have to turn to my own
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
experience in Northampton where we have seen the tortuous negotiations that go on between the development corporation, local authorities and the Treasury. If there are the genuine worries we have to recognise that when society asks a community to help overcome a problem society must foot the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether the word is "increased" or "undue", I do not know, but I do know that the very great good will that has been generated over the years will be jeopardised if the right hon. Gentleman does not on Report make it crystal clear that these burdens will not exist for the community, and that there will be help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that, and with the commitment from the right hon. Gentleman that he will look at this again and come back to us, and reserving our position to come back to him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Ladies on both sides, reflects anxieties which are widely felt outside Parliament, in new towns and elsewhere, among people of all political opinions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said last week that I was extremely sorry that the amendment which I put down to remove the word "undue", and to insert the word "increased", was out of order, as I believe that that amendment raises a key issue, which is to avoid increased burdens being put upon the tenants and residents of new towns on transfer. I have always believed that transfer was right, and I have worked for it for years, but if the Bill were to lead to heavily increased payments and burdens

being placed upon tenants, and new town residents as a whole, it would be widely regarded as being unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) retreated a little from the logic of the amendment put down by hon. Gentlemen opposite, but, at the same time, I agreed with him that it would be wrong to push it at this stage. It is now possible to quantify the future burdens which could be imposed upon tenants and residents of new towns. As has already been pointed out, the position in first generation towns will be different from that in towns built when interest rates had become very much higher. The size of the burdens could be affected by the expansion of new towns, as is at present under consideration in Harlow, which I represent. None the less, in view of the undertaking which has been given by my right hon. Friend to have another look at this matter I do not think it would be right to support the amendment at this stage, but I should like to say that I reserve the right on Report to give careful consideration to any changes which he proposes, and I shall then have to make up my mind whether I feel able to support any amendment that is introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the points of the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) are well received, certainly by myself and by my hon. Friends. He confirmed very much what we on this side feel, but he did a slight injustice to my hon. Friend in suggesting that he was retreating. I think that what he was doing, rightly, was reflecting on whether the amendment, if carried, would protect local authorities and the Exchequer from maverick situations, and I think the right hon. Gentleman opposite had that slight worry at the back of his mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat, that we shall listen with great care to what the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend say on Report. From a financial point of view, this is the most important area, and we shall not hesitate to press him if he comes with something fairly woolly. We believe—we cannot put this too strongly—that it is in the interests of people that there should be no burden put upon them, and we look forward to seeing what amendment is brought forward.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a relatively minor amendment, and when the hon. Gentleman replies it may be seen to be unnecessary, but I wish to make it clear that, when we are communicating to occupiers about a transfer, it will not be sufficient for a new town or a local authority to give only general information. They must take particular care to ensure that all occupiers are informed. The method may or may not be laid down, and there are different ways of communicating with people. For instance, it would not be adequate just to rely on the local newspapers, because the readership varies immensely in an area. What we are asking for is that those concerned should make every conceivable effort to ensure that all persons who are occupiers are informed of a scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, I am grateful for the moving of this amendment, which I recognise is a probing one, because it gives me an opportunity of explaining the difference in the wording of subsections (1) and (2) of the Clause. The Committee will have noticed that in the latter subsection a corporation is required to secure that all occupiers of the buildings or other land transferred or managed are informed of the way in which they are affected by the transfer scheme, while subsection (1) requires them to take steps to draw the attention of occupiers of buildings or other land, etc. So that the word "all" appears in one case and not in the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A deliberate distinction has been drawn in this clause. Whereas subsection (2) is concerned with the situation where a transfer has actually taken place, or land has actually been subject to management schemes, and is directed to securing notification of the occupiers of the buildings or other land involved, the steps required by subsection (1) have to be taken before a scheme for transfer and arrangements for management have been negotiated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
At that time no one knows which properties will be included in the transfer or management arrangements. Therefore, it is appropriate to require the corporation only to secure that the possibility of the transfer scheme and its likely effects are generally known in the areas to which it is likely to relate. In all the circumstances, the inclusion of the word "all" in subsection (1) would impose a greater requirement on the corporation than is either necessary or appropriate. That is the reason for the distinction, and I hope that, in the circumstances, the hon. Gentleman will agree that it would not be appropriate to accept this amendment. I hope that what I have said explains why the clause is drafted in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation, and I now understand the difference between the two parts. I am not sure that I am entirely convinced by him, because there is a danger. While I understand that there may be properties that will not be transferred or involved, we have come a long way in local government over the last few years in trying to make greater efforts to ensure that everybody concerned knows what is happening, even if a margin may not be too directly concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we now have a clear exposition on the record, which those concerned will presumably read, so I shall not press this amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

lines 1 to 6 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"in its application to a person who as a result of a transfer scheme is, after the scheme comes into force, in new employment with a different employer".</p></blockquote>
This amendment has two purposes. First, it deletes the reference to paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 to the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974. Secondly, it applies the adaptation of Schedule 1 to the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 which is set out in Clause 12(5) only to persons whose change in employment occurs as a result of a transfer scheme. The first part of the amendment corrects an error in drafting. There is no need to mention separately paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 to the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 because it is covered by the reference on page 12, line 45, to "any other enactment".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of the amendment corrects lines 4 and 5 on page 13. The subsection provides that, for the purposes of the Contracts of Employment Act and various other statutes—for example, the statutory provisions concerning unfair dismissal—a break in employment due to a transfer scheme is to be ignored in computing a period of "continuous employment"; but the wording of lines 4 and 5 applies that protection to employees of a new town corporation or a district council who are in different employment following a transfer scheme, whether or not their transfer is as a result of such a scheme. The amended wording restricts the protection to the persons specified in subsection (2); that is, those who, as a result of a transfer scheme, are in new employment with the same employer or employed by the other party to the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(if it would not otherwise be so treated)".</p></blockquote>
The effect of the amendment is to make it clear that the provision of subsection (6) may not need to apply in respect of all transfer schemes. This is a drafting amendment to subsection (6) to deal with a possible overlap between the provisions of that subsection and subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the two subsections is to secure that a change of employment as the direct result of a transfer scheme does not prejudice an employee's rights in respect of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>239</span>
unfair dismissal, redundancy payments and certain other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those rights in each case depend upon the employee's having been "continuously employed" for a certain period. Subsection (5) deals with those statutory provisions to which Schedule 1 to the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 applies; and subsection (6) applies, with adaptations, Section 13 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965. That section of the 1965 Act, taken together with section 3 of the same Act, provides that where there is a change in the ownership of business and an employee is employed by the new owner of the business the cessation of his first employment does not constitute a "dismissal" for the purpose of obtaining a redundancy payment. It was originally thought that it would be necessary for this clause 12 to apply Section 13 of the 1965 Act in respect of all transfer schemes; but we now understand that where the whole of a new town corporation's housing undertaking is transferred by the same scheme to one district council the provisions of paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 to the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 will apply to employees who are in "new employment" as defined in subsection (2) of this clause as a result of the scheme. Paragraph 9 of that schedule has a similar effect to that of Section 13 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965. Accordingly, it is not necessary to apply that latter provision to transfer schemes where the whole of the new town corporation's housing undertaking is transferred by the same scheme to one district council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause is an important part of the Bill and it is right that we should have a short discussion on it. We have not put down any amendments to the clause and we are not opposed to it, but it is reasonable to take this opportunity to seek a little more detail about what is entailed and to make one or two observations about the scheme which the clause embodies. We have had one bite at this particular cherry in a rather brief debate on Clause 4, but I think it right to come back to it again now that it is before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>240</span>
I would reiterate the point that we all have a feeling that perhaps the reorganisation of local government was, if anything, almost too generous in terms of the staff arrangements. It is absolutely right, when we make a major reorganisation, carefully to bear the interests of staff in mind. We certainly leant over backwards to look after the interests of staff when local government was reorganised. On the whole I think we did so in a reasonable way, but most of us will accept that there were points where, perhaps, we were over reasonable, and that the reorganisation, in some parts of the country, entailed a degree of overstaffing. We do not want to do anything to encourage overstaffing under the provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not, as a country, either at national or local level, in a position to afford more money for local government than we have to. This is a reasonable point to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would also make the point, which is a fair one, that a number of people who have worked in the new town movement have done so in the spirit of doing something which is rather different, and which entails a period of working flat out to achieve particular objectives, and working in circumstances where, perhaps, one has slightly more freedom of action, and more opportunity to exercise initiative, than is often the case in local government. At least a number of senior people have not looked at their work in new towns as something which they would necessarily do all their lives. I think that most of the people who work in the new town movement do not look at this as something they will do for 40 years, or whatever, but see it as a job for a limited period of time to try to build a new town, and foresee that when they have completed that job they could move on to something else. This is an admirable spirit which has led to the success of some of the new town provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent, the new town animal is a slightly different animal from the ordinary local government animal and may be he does not have to be cosseted so carefully. This obviously only applies to a limited number of people in new towns. Most people who enter that service do so, perhaps, in much the same sort of spirit as they would enter the local government service; but there is a feeling that it is not necessarily a permanent career for all time. It is reasonable to look carefully at the proposals which are put before us for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>241</span>
dealing with this group of people who have served the country well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Allied with this I would raise a point which, in relation to the future of new towns, is triggered off by the transfer of housing assets. A number of people feel that the new town corporations have done some splendid and remarkable things. They have built up what I suppose one could call multidisciplinary teams, or groups of people, who have had to deal with housing, industry and so on. They have a certain degree of expertise. These teams ought to be kept together, because there are parts of the country with the kinds of problem with which they have had to deal. There is, for example, a point of view which says we ought to be taking the new town development corporation approach and applying it to some of our big cities. Many people have said that the way to deal with dockland in London is to have a new town corporation to deal with it. I have heard other poeple suggest that this is the way to deal with the inner area of Liverpool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed recently a letter from the General Manager of the Stevenage Corporation, to the Secretary of State, and it said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It might be considered whether the new towns staffs, when no longer required, might form into regional development agencies undertaking on behalf of local authorities, the housing corporation or housing associations, major town development or town centre redevelopment or housing schemes such as they are accustomed to."</p></blockquote>
In other words, he is saying that if we have this group of expertise, and these people who are used to working together, can we transfer them to other fields?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise this point at this stage for two reasons. First, I simply want to sound the Minister out as to whether the Government have thought on these lines and whether they have in mind applying the new town principle and the new town team, as it were, to different sorts of situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, to say that I am always rather sceptical when people talk about keeping teams in being. It is a familiar ploy in the big engineering industries such as aviation that whenever there is a cutback the cry goes up "We have to keep this valuable team in being, therefore, let us keep projects going even though they are losing hundreds of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>242</span>
millions of pounds a year." This is a cry that we ought to treat with a certain degree of caution and scepticism. Obviously, it would be a rather ingenious way of getting over the fact that people simply want to stay put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This raises the general point about whether, in the Government's view, there is any future for these teams or whether, in fact, the opportunity which remains for those people working for the development corporations is simply either to transfer to the local authority or go out into the general market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised some interesting points. I would like him to make clear whether he means that automatically they would be transferred by some authoritarian person like the Minister or whether, if there is a planning project in a certain part of the country, the recruitment of the officers needed for this regional plan would be done through advertising in order to get the very best of the people available, who would present themselves in the ordinary way for employment. It is a matter of opinion whether planning is good or bad. The hon. Gentleman would agree that not all new towns have been an unqualified success—as in Central Lancashire and Skelmersdale. I am asking the hon. Gentleman whether he commends the transfer of a group or whether he would allow the normal procedures of recruitment to come through advertising for posts and filling them in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an interesting, if somewhat lengthy, intervention. I am, in a sense, recording the fact that there has been discussion on this point of keeping teams together and moving them on to new kinds of projects. I am asking the Minister whether the Government, or the Department of the Environment, have any ideas about this possibility. I would agree that there is a great deal to be said for advertising jobs openly rather than giving a kind of prior or presumed right to particular individuals to move from one area of action to another. One must take a commonsense view about this. If there are enormous advantages from the fact that a group of people have worked together, and if it can be shown that they have done a good job, we can be quite pragmatic about it. My concern is simply to question the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0509">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>243</span>
about what the Government see as being the right way of dealing with those development corporation people who are not going to make the switch to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would repeat that one has to be careful about overstaffing. There is a tendency to overstaff. When we were talking about the question of grants under Clause 9 to make sure that local authorities did not suffer a loss as a result of the transfer of housing assets, it seemed to me that one possibility which might occur would be that a local authority might give jobs to everybody, both to its own people and the development corporation people. It might, in other words, have an inflated staff. For instance, the two top chaps would both retain top jobs, and so on down the line. This would be one example of the kind of standard which could build up. The cost would fall on the taxpayer. It would be the taxpayer who would have to pay for inflated staffing in the new local authority set-up. That seems to be one possible reading, as the clause stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should approach the whole question of the transfer of staff with a fairly, if not exactly, critical eye. Nevertheless, staff are entitled to fair treatment. This is what the clause is all about. By and large, as far as I can judge, they seem to be getting fair treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Minister to say a little more about the provisions for redundancy. They are cloaked in a variety of subsections in the clause, in particular subsection (4). Would they cover the contingencies which might arise? Perhaps hon. Members on either side of the Committee will raise points which have been put to them by staff in their own parts of the world. If they do they will speak with the kind of direct local knowledge to which I cannot aspire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate gives us the opportunity to express a genuine feeling that we do not want to end up with overstaffing, thinking that all of the boys ought to have jobs. In this context we want to see that the provisions made for staff are fair, and realistic. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say about this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a important clause. I deeply appreciate the enormous contribution which has been made to the success of Harlow, my own town, by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>244</span>
many loyal and dedicated employees of the corporation over many years. It would be wrong not to give the most careful consideration to their interests. Many of these people are no longer young, and for them, moving to a new area is no longer an easy business. It may involve them in having to uproot themselves and their families, or, on the other hand, in leaving their families, and roots which have already gone deep where they live. This must be considered very carefully because a team of people who settled in a particular new town doing a job 20 years ago is not the same team today and certainly cannot be picked up as a group and transferred elsewhere. Too many difficulties arise where human beings are involved. I refer to my own new town, but I am sure that, generally speaking, employees of development corporations and at a later stage the Commission for the New Towns have done, by an large, an excellent job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need to strike the right balance between treating employees unfairly and, on the other hand, saddling a local authority, when it takes over, with an increased burden of staff and expenses which will continually make the authority's job difficult in the future. Having carefully considered the clause and read representations made to me, I believe the provisions are about right, and, in these circumstances, I hope we shall be able to pass this clause, and that employees of development corporations will be looked after in a reasonable manner and helped in the future, while we make sure that their skills are not wasted, and that, at the same time, local authorities are allowed freedom of movement in certain respects, to which, undoubtedly, they will be entitled when they take over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an earlier debate the question was raised of the position of staff likely to be most quickly affected by the transfer, and particularly the position of those holding jobs under the commission. There is some uncertainty as to the future rôle of the commission itself, and, therefore about staff, who may or may not find themselves required. Staff will continue to be greatly concerned about what is happening in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>245</span>
period between now and 1st April in terms of recruitment by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will put the dilemma clearly. None of us is trying to persuade the Minister, the Staff Advisory Committee or the commission, that unwieldy and overmanned organisations should be set up in district councils to which there has been a transfer of assets. On the other hand, we are dealing with a group of people, particularly those in commission towns, and, going back still further, new towns such as Welwyn and Hatfield, who have dedicated their lives to those areas and who will face a great deal of difficulty, in practical terms, because of their age, in continuing to contribute to the areas, although wanting to stay where they are. They will face difficulty in finding new employment. We should safeguard their interests in terms of the kind of compensation we are willing to give them, plans for early retirement, redundancy payments and other provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These people are particularly worried, particularly since the reorganisation consequent upon this Bill follows the reorganisation of local government, as a result of which many posts have been filled. This further reorganisation is at a time when local government itself is unable, perhaps, to expand in the way it would like, and, therefore, does not have an increasing staff requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect at which we should look is the position of the development corporations in recruiting staff at present and in future, because those corporations will have great difficulty in getting people of the required calibre if there is an axe over employees' heads in terms of future transfer, under which they will not get from the local authority the kind of deal, in terms of compensation or job opportunities, or adequate compensation to which they consider they are entitled. Those are points which I should like to stress to the Minister and, through him, to the Staff Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the local authorities involved will recognise the difficulties of the new towns staffs as well as those of their own staff. Inevitably, local authorities will have loyalty to their own staffs, and one of the worries of the staffs of the development corporations and the Commission is that, following local government reorganisation, councillors from authorities which have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>246</span>
been merged, the previous employers, will be on selection boards for filling new jobs. The staffs are concerned that in this kind of situation, when the New Towns Commission is being wound up and the development corporations' assets transferred, there will possibly be no one on the selection boards to represent the views and interests of those members of the staffs. Perhaps the Minister would look at the role of the Staff Commission and ensure that the interests of these people are safeguarded. It is not easy to strike a balance here, but we should not deal meanly with those, many of whom, have given a lifetime of service to the new towns. Their interests ought to be safeguarded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly I, and I believe other hon. Members, have been very impressed with the degree of expertise of some senior members of the new towns staffs, and it would be a loss to the community and to the country generally if they were totally discarded. That is not to say some of them will not be redundant, but I suspect that the calibre of some of those running the new towns is probably superior to that of a fair number of officers in certain other parts of the Department of the Environment. I would hope very much that some of this expertise will not be lost—possibly even overseas; in discussions with certain senior members of new towns I learned that they have had attractive offers from overseas. With the diminution of the problems in dockland and some inner urban areas, the Department of the Environment would be well advised to look at the possibilities of using some of this expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I would make a plea for new towns to consider very seriously the position of men and women who are within 10 years of retirement. They may well have given the best part of a lifetime to their new town, and it is extremely difficult for people of that age to move from their present environment to a new job. I come from an industry from which by its nature one tends to retire at 55 or to move to another job. In the advertising industry there is a long tradition that at the age of about 55 one gets out and does something easier—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At 35.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—though having come into politics I am not so sure. But there is that frontier and I would respectfully suggest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>247</span>
in all sincerity to the New Towns Staff Commission that it would not be beyond its terms of reference to consult the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising which has long experience of employing senior people, albeit at a lower salary level. Some of these senior people may have to accept that their particular job dimension, in terms of salary, has to diminish if they are to remain in their own environment. The possibility of employing them needs to be looked at even within local authorities within the area. They will have to accept a lower salary, but with adequate compensation to make up for loss of prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I hope the commission and all of us will face the fact that there will be redundancies and a time when, for once in our lives in this country, local authorities are fully staffed. Recognising that situation we have regretfully to accept that this will mean redundancies. It is important that it should go on the record that it is right in a society which is growing and changing that people should change jobs and should look to new frontiers. I do not think it is any hardship for those in the age group under 50 to be asked at a certain point in their careers to think again and look for other jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can see the pension provision is fairly concrete here, but I have had the example of a constituent who, after the war changed, from the Ministry of Defence to the Diplomatic Wire Service. He exceeded his out-of-service period of 30 days by about four days and lost his pension rights in respect of his period of war service. I do not consider it tenable for anybody to lose his service pension rights because of such a tiny adjustment, through inflexible rules. I hope, therefore, that the transferability of the pension element will be closely looked at so that if someone moves into the private sector or to, say, the electricity authority, there will be sufficient flexibility to ensure pension transferability. It is really untenable that in this day and age people who have spent all their life in this field and have made a contribution to it should be told "It must be a paid up pension because the pension scheme into which you are going does not fit in with Government service."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those three points, and in the belief that the commission will look at those and other 'points that have been made, I will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
listen with interest to what the hon. Gentleman has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a very useful and interesting debate on the future of the staff of the new town corporations. I propose to take a little time replying to it because I believe everyone in the Committee understands the anxiety felt by those who work for the commission and new town corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make clear that we are aiming at full and fair protection for them through the provisions of this Clause 12. I was very glad to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) say he thought we have properly struck the right balance. That is not easy to do, but probably the clause does it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with a number of points which have been raised. First, we are not providing, in addition, an equivalent of Section 260 of the Local Government Act 1972. As was made clear on Second Reading, when hon. Members on both sides supported our decision not to include Section 260 type provision, this transfer of housing assets is very different from local government reorganisation. There were 1,200 local authorities reduced in number to just over 400. The present Bill will affect far fewer staff, over a long period of time. Because it is concerned with transfer of assets rather than merging of authorities, we hope that good sense will prevail and that redundancies will be kept to a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) has said, redundancies will occur and some staff at senior levels may be affected, but staff over the age of 50 who, under the local government reorganisation, might have qualified for Section 260 provision can retire with an immediate occupational pension, in addition to getting Crombie Code compensation under subsection (4) of the clause. For persons at or around the age of 60 who are unlikely to have further prospects of employment this combination of pensions works out even more generously than the Section 260 terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one can reasonably claim that the Crombie provisions in subsection (4) are unfair or inadequate in compensating staff who become redundant as a result of a transfer of assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>249</span>
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the more senior staff, there will again be redundancies at other levels. In previous sittings hon. Members have referred to staff in departments other than housing. Staff in the finance or personnel departments of the corporations or the Commission for the New Towns whose jobs become superfluous as the result of the transfer stand a fair chance of being absorbed into the corresponding local authority departments which are likely to need some expansion as a result of the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not be the case for every individual. I expect that there will be some economies of scale in the interests of the efficient management of local authorities and to reflect our concern for control over public expenditure. The majority of new town staff in departments which have a counterpart in local authority organisations should be able to find such a job without too much difficulty if they want it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doubt has been cast on that, and it has been said that many new town staff would not want the routine of local government life. That was mentioned by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison). He is entitled to that view, and the staff in question are entitled to make their choice, but I hope that most of the new town staff affected by transfers will see the opportunity to move on to a district council as a new and interesting challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some staff in new town corporations who have no obvious or exact counterparts in local government, and that was referred to in a previous debate by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller). They may include community development officers who play a vital part in establishing a community spirit in the new towns. We scarcely ever hear now that dismal phrase of the 1960s—"new town blues"; and that is largely due to the hard and energetic work of the community development staff. However, when a town is substantially completed, and the time is ripe for the transfer of housing, their main task is done. In the context of new towns, community development staff are by definition concerned with the development of new communities, and once the community is established as a healthy, thriving entity the work of this special staff is of less significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aylesbury suggested recently and repeated today that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
staff of development corporations are not the sort of people who necessarily think in terms of a lifelong career. There are many jobs in which lifelong protection is not provided. Community development staff, like other staff, may find work in local authorities; some may stay to complete their work for the development corporations; but whatever the circumstances of the ending of their job in the new town, they will be afforded reasonable terms of compensation, including, where applicable, those available under the Crombie Code.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to refer to the Staff Advisory Committee's role and the question of recruitment to local authority housing departments between now and April 1977. The Staff Advisory Committee under Sir Richard Hayward's chairmanship began its work immediately after the Second Reading debate. It has been energetically tackling its task and consulting staff representatives in new towns and local authorities. The Committee has been giving top priority to the question of ring fences in recruitment. That is of particular interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn and Hatfield (Mrs. Hayman). It is likely that the committee will recommend the Secretary of State to provide for such fences in his regulations under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, probable that at a later stage of the Bill we shall need to bring forward a small amendment to ensure that the regulations under subsection (1) apply before the making of a transfer scheme as well as after the approval of such a scheme as is provided at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will not expect me to anticipate the precise recommendations of the Staff Advisory Committee as to where and how the ring fences are to be erected, but the advisory committee is consulting the various interested parties urgently in an effort to find a fair and generally acceptable arrangement, and hopes to give its advice as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with the concern expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that, particularly in towns where transfers are likely to take place, the staff of the Commission for the New Towns or of the relevant development corporations should have the first opportunity of consideration for any relevant vacancies arising with the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will not press me to say more at this stage. We have set
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
up the Staff Advisory Committee to look into just that kind of problem. I am satisfied that we are going about our task as speedily as is consistent with a full and thorough appreciation of what is involved. If on Report we are in a position to say more, I assure the Committee that my right hon. Friend and I will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister, and interested in what he is saying. The point raised about the need to give the staff from the development corporations a fair crack of the whip is extremely important. It would be wrong if it became the normal practice for the local authority officer to get the job. These appointments will be made to some extent by the local authorities, and I wonder whether we should give consideration to making some statutory provision. It might be difficult to draft, but should not there be a statutory provision, direction, requirement or whatever, to establish equality of opportunity between the two sets of candidates for these appointments? We might come back to this matter on Report, but I should like to hear the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the importance of that matter, but I am not at the moment in a position to deal with it. It is a new point to me, although I recognise its force. I suggest that we should consider it between now and Report. It is part of the advisory committee's responsibility to look at this matter. The advisory committee, as a matter of top priority, is considering the situation as it is likely to affect the staff of the commission and the first generation of new towns. That is all I am able to say at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by emphasising again the importance we attach to the protection of staff interests. We believe that the clause provides that framework, subject to the small amendment I have mentioned that may be needed to ensure that we can erect the necessary ring fences. I am sure that whatever will be the advice of the Staff Advisory Committee we shall be able to ensure adequate and fair treatment of the staff affected by the transfer of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take on board the general point that has been made several times during the debate about the relevant quality and experience of the staff of the new town corporations and the commission. Sug-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
gestions have been made of places where that experience and ability might find a relevance, particularly among younger staff elsewhere. These transfers will take place over a period of time. For some, there is a real possibility of absorption into the employment of district councils, and others may have skills and experience that have a relevance in this country or overseas. Taking those matters into account, and given good sense, I feel sure that a solution will be found satisfactory to all concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That Clause 14 stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the Second Reading debate I mentioned that this clause had something slightly Parkinsonian about it. Although the new town corporations will have less to do because housing is being transferred, more members of the development corporation seem by the clause to be required. That is the sort of provision we expect from Socialism and the Government. On that occasion that suggestion produced a certain amount of tut-tutting from the Minister in charge of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Under-Secretary of State why he feels there is a need to increase the number of members of the development corporations from seven to 11. When we are talking in terms of a rundown, I cannot see why there should be an increase in this size. On the whole, the development corporations have done a perfectly good job with seven members, and I want to know why this proportionately substantial increase in size is needed. I suspect that the Minister will say that he wants to bring in more local government people. Perhaps there is something to be said for that, but I am not sure. It would be a pity to dilute the achievement of the new towns, namely,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>253</span>
their get up and go feeling. We are more likely to achieve a get up and go feeling from a smaller body rather than a larger body at the top.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first purpose in rising is to ask the Minister to explain these Parkinsonian provisions and justify them to the Committee. We have a certain amount of political apprehension about what tricks the Government will get up to with these enlarged development corporations, assuming that the clause goes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller), like one of my other hon. Friends who is unable to be here this morning, has been put on another Standing Committee—no doubt, the work of the splendid new Committee of Selection. He told me that no less than five out of seven of the new appointments to the Redditch Development Corporation which have just been made by the Minister are Socialist appointments. That is in an area which has just chucked out the Socialists and sensibly elected a Conservative majority in the local government elections. There is evidence of that happening also in other parts of the country. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) said that this was a good thing. He made no bones about wanting every development corporation to consist entirely of Socialists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. W. Stallard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that the Whip is breaking the silence which is generally throught to be the characteristic of Whips. That is wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One achievement of the development corporations in the post-war period has been that they have not been unduly buffeted by party politics. They have, generally speaking, worked in a tolerably bi-partisan way. That is why new towns have not been more in the political arena, and have got on with their job with reasonable success. I am suspicious of the Government's motive in seeking to increase the size of development corporations for reasons of bureaucracy and Socialism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. More) put down an Amendent, No. 84, to this clause. It has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
not been called. It would have added these words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A majority of the members of a development corporation shall be appointed by the Minister from persons nominated by such local authorities as appear to him to be concerned with the development of the new town."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend put down the amendment because the Association of County Councils expressed that point of view. The association did not ask for the amendment to be put down. I assume that it has been ruled out of order. I do not complain of that, but there is a feeling on the part of the Association of County Councils that there should be a majority of local authority representatives on the development corporations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend put it down in no more than a probing spirit. He merely wanted an opportunity for this point of view to have an airing, and, may be, to hear some comment from the Government about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I myself am not in favour of the proposal put forward by the Association of County Councils. If one has a new town it makes sense not to have it in some way subservient to the local authorities. New towns are a different sort of animal, and I am not anxious that they should change their nature, but it is not unreasonable that the association, which has a considerable interest in this Bill, should have a chance for this point to be aired. May be we can draw the Minister on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to the desire of the Government to appoint Socialists to new town corporations. If my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North (Mrs. Colquhoun) cheered about this term "Socialist" it is probably because she and I would like to see all Labour party members as Socialists. I sometimes wonder whether the hon. Gentleman knows what the term means. In Central Lancashire New Town there is not a single Socialist member because they were appointed during a time when the Conservatives were in power. Nor was there a single representative of the local authorities, except for one, a Conservative lady. Bearing in mind the amendment put down by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. More), she herself was appointed not because of any interest in the town but because she had held office. Until the time of her appointment she had shown no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
interest in the new town corporation other than a certain antagonism. After she was appointed she continued to have as little knowledge of the new town area as she had before. As regards appointing people who are interested in the area there was one person appointed from well outside the area whose chief distinction was that he was probably the finest football manager in the whole country. I hoped that that would mean that in the new town there would be a lot of football pitches planned, but in fact there were not any. There was a strong incidence of golf courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear. The hon. Member has Preston North End, has he not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would support the suggestion that people who are appointed should be interested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are aspects of this debate in which it would be unwise for me to enter. As I listened to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) I thought he seemed to think that there were all kinds of dark intentions behind this clause. He seemed to think that we would use it for the purpose of putting Socialists there. He spoke, and perhaps it was a Freudian passage, in such a way as to suggest almost that there never would be another Conservative Government, and if there were a Conservative Government ever again it would be most unlikely they would never use the provisions in this clause to appoint Conservative district councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing underhand and there is no dark intention behind this clause. It is permissive. It does not mean that as soon as the Bill becomes law it is the intention of the Secretary of State to up the number of people sitting on new town corporations in every case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is made necessary by two factors. The first is that during the period of transfer there is, I would have thought, an obvious argument in favour of having one or two extra members. Not in every case. There could be an advantage in having one or two extra members representative of district councils. One could foresee this situation existing, not in every new town, but in, perhaps, an exceptional case. Central Lancashire New Town strikes us as an example. There, three district
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
councils are involved, and it may be necessary to have that degree of flexibility to enable the Secretary of State to make odd extra appointments in order that the district council has greater representation on the new town corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That, literally, is all the intention that lies behind this clause. It would be unfair to suggest that this clause is likely to be used in a great number of cases, and certainly by the present Secretary of State. It is only simply to give him flexibility in those situations where it is obviously desirable to up the size of a corporation by perhaps one or two members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I get it clear? Is the Minister saying that the only cases where he sees the increase happening is where a transfer scheme is about to be made or has just been made and these extra persons from the local authorities will be there to assist the transfer provisions, and there will be no cases of a decision to increase the numbers? Take my own case in Northampton. The development corporation there at some time in the future will have a transfer. At the moment it works perfectly well with two from both sides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member would not be correct in that sense. I was straying a little far from the immediate point and suggesting that during the period of transfer the existence of extra people on the corporation might be advantageous. This clause is more directly concerned with the Central Lancashire New Town position where there are three district councils involved and where there would be advantage in giving that extra flexibility to enable more appointments to be made. I hope that covers the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Sometimes our proceedings have been interesting, sometimes, perhaps, a little dull, but there were times when I thought that you were becoming possibly even quite interested in some of the discussions we were having. We have all of us appreciated the good humour with which you have handled our proceedings. I believe we had a brief discussion on this subject about halfway through the proceedings and at that time we agreed that good humour very often pays off. If I may use that word again, the "flexible" way in which you have handled some of our proceedings has paid off, because the Committee as a whole has been able to air, in the way we wanted, the anxieties and problems of areas involved in transfers.

I agree with the Minister that this has been a fairly good-humoured Committee. It has been one of those animals which sprints strongly at the finish having moved slowly in the early stages. We have managed to air important points embodied in the Bill. There are a number of matters to be cleared up on Report. We look for the co-operation of the Government at that time, because we are not completely happy about everything. It is evident that the financial provisions will be raised on Report. There are one or two other matters.
