	<p>[Mr. ARTHUR JONES 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>INDUSTRIAL COMMON OWNERSHIP BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That if the proceedings on the Industrial Common Ownership Bill are not completed at this day's sitting, the Committee do meet on Wednesday next at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
It might be appropriate if I made a short statement in support of the Sittings Motion. I appreciate that a number of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have been inconvenienced by the late tabling of some important amendments. I wonder whether we might consider getting through the early stages—that is to say, up to and including the deletion of Clause 1, which can be done by agreeing that it should not stand part of the Bill—this morning. I would then be happy to adjourn the Committee until next week in order that hon. Members and indeed you, Mr. Jones, would have an opportunity to consider what are, at present, starred amendments. In this way, we might make progress, which I am sure the Committee would wish to make, and in an amicable atmosphere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly for my part and, I hope, with the agreement of my hon. Friends, that sounds a reasonable and courteous arrangement. We are grateful to the hon. Member for what he has said. We know that the difficulties which have arisen are not of his making but of the Government's making, in that they tabled these substantial amendments to redraft the Bill at such a late stage. I would certainly have no intention of opposing the Sittings Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The selection of amendments is before us. I remind the Committee that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DEFINITION OF COMMON OWNERSHIP ENTERPRISE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 17, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"and equal as between all".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 17, leave out "equal" and insert "fair".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly these two amendments are closely related to the same point. Both are tabled in order that one or the other might be acceptable to the sponsors of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point at issue here is that in a common ownership enterprise, the way in which that enterprise is run, provided that it does not transgress against the law of the land or, indeed, against the law of common decency—however one interprets that—should be, to the greatest possible extent, left to those in it. It is in no way contrary to the concept of a common-owned firm that some persons within it might have contributed more, and might be contributing more, than others—for example, not necessarily by the financial contribution which they might have made in setting up the business, but by the number of years they have worked in the business or by the nature of their job in the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly there are some businesses where one or two people are absolutely key men and and as near irreplaceable as anybody is in this world. For example, in a business concerned with chemical processing there might be two or three people who hold in their minds the key to the firm's development. It is not unreasonable that in those circumstances it should be for those who formed the business in the first place, bringing together those who participate in it, to decide on what basis the voting shall be conducted. It is not necessary that it should always be on the basis of one man one vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could leave out entirely the words "and equal as between all" and we would have a situation where anything goes. One could accept Amendment No. 2, leave out the word "equal" and insert "fair", thereby putting a legislative gloss on the matter—it could not be anything
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0319">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
more than gloss because what is fair to one man is not necessarly fair to another—with a heavy implication that there would need to be a case made in the firm, and those in it would have to agree, before there was a change from what would probably be the normal pattern of one man one vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to make progress, particularly as we are being diplomatic this morning. French diplomacy may win the day, as has been observed in private beforehand, and I know that several hon. Members want to hear the French President later this morning. I shall not, therefore, say anything more about the amendments, but I hope that the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins), whose Bill this is, will be able to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in some ways in a slightly academic situation. I appreciate the points which the hon. Gentleman made in moving the amendment, and the reasonable way he has done so. I accept that there is an important point of principle embodied in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In saying that we are in a slightly academic situation. I refer to the fact that there is later a proposal to delete Clause 1. In view of that, would the hon. Gentleman be prepared to consider not pressing the amendment because the opportunity will arise to discuss the same point of principle on the new Clause 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for my hon. Friends who may want to say something on this point this morning, but it seems to me that we would be in some possible danger if we went too far along this road and did not press the amendments further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are closely paralleled by the amendments which are starred to the Government's new Clauses. Indeed, we could easily have the same debate when we come to the amendments to New Clause 1. To a large extent I am in your hands, Mr. Jones, and the Committee's. Perhaps you could indicate whether, if we did not discuss these amendments to any great extent this morning, we could come back to the parallel amendments to New Clause 1 if New Clause 1 should be read a Second time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that will be acceptable to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite 24 hours since I learned that I was a member of this Committee. I approach the subject, therefore, with a mind completely unclouded by prior information. But I am extremely interested, and I should like to ask a question on a genuine point of information. I am impressed by what my hon. Friend said about the potential difficulties that would arise if somebody who had recently joined a common ownership enterprise was immediately vested with the same voting rights as somebody who had been in it perhaps all his working life and played a particularly important part in its operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I see the classic advantage of one man one vote that distinguishes democracy. But I should like to ask whether any of the examples of common ownership enterprises that were referred to on Second Reading are conducted on a basis of unequal voting rights—rights which are formulated according to some different principle—or whether every one of them is run on the basis of equal voting rights, or indeed whether the hon. Member who sponsored the Bill knows of any examples of common ownership enterprises with unequal voting rights as the basis for self-government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not an easy question to answer, one of the reasons being that at present there is no legal definition of what constitutes a common ownership company. The principal object of the Bill is indeed to produce such a definition, but the hon. and learned Gentleman has quite rightly asked reasonable questions about existing common ownership enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point in relation to the non-existence of a legal definition is that it can, and indeed does, vary around the general principle of common ownership. I could not, therefore, answer the question specifically and give details and name company A or company X—company A perhaps being run on a one-person one-vote basis, and company X on a different basis. But I should think that it is quite likely that such companies do exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cases of which I have knowledge are those where there is "a probationary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
period" when one joins the company. That is to say, one has a period in which to make up one's mind, and so far as I am aware—indeed I think that I can say with almost absolute certainty—in every case it is purely a voluntary matter as to whether one takes up full membership with voting rights accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could quote the words of Peter Elliot, of Sunderlandia, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We'd got a lot of people here for the joy-ride…"—</p></blockquote>
because the board accepted anyone who applied.
	<br><blockquote><p>" Now they have to show a positive commitment to the company's ideals before they can become full members."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. Sunderlandia was one of the examples which I mentioned on Second Reading. This was a company which was started as a common ownership enterprise, as compared with others which have converted from what I might call a conventional type of company into a form of common ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the overall point here is that each one has its own articles of association, constitution and rules which are based on the general principle of protecting the position of the individual and enabling him to exercise control and make a choice as to whether he wishes to take up full membership. I hope that that deals with the hon. and learned Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess that this is a curious procedure that we have on the amendment paper. It is a Bill which has had its Second Reading, and as far as I can see, every clause except No. 8 is being removed and the Government are taking over the Bill. I hope that it will not delay the proceedings of the Committee this morning if the sponsor of the Bill could say, broadly speaking, whether he is accepting the Government's proposal, because I do detect fairly fearful differences in wording between the Government's definition and what is in the hon. Member's Bill. Like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Mayhew) I ask more for information purposes than to be in any way hostile to the purposes of the Bill. It would assist our proceedings if
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the hon. Member could say in broad terms whether he has accepted the Government's proposals, and whether it is the amended Bill with which we are now dealing, not the one which received a Second Reading. If that is so, there are a number of questions on Clause 1 which we could put round these amendments but which I would defer until we discuss the Government's definition of common ownership. I may be wrong, but I detect a certain difference in emphasis between the hon. Member's proposal as currently drafted and the Government's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The procedure in the Committee appears to be developing into a dialogue between myself and certain hon. Members rather than my winding up after hon. Members have made their contributions. I am happy with this, as I realise that these are pertinent points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Government's new clauses which have been tabled, although, as hon. Members will see. I have tabled two amendments to one of them, which shows that there are some points I wish to have queried and possibly even changed. In the House this morning, in the early hours, I indicated my acceptance of the Government's proposal, which does not, in my view, materially alter the substance of the Bill. I am prepared to go more fully into these points later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstances, after the discussion that we have had, if it be the pleasure of the Committee, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recommend to the Committee that Clause 1 does not stand part of the Bill. I notice a certain understandable reaction from hon. Members who, even after the events in the early hours of this morning in the House, may be rather surprised to hear the promoter of the Bill suggesting that the main definition clause, the clause which defines what constitutes a common ownership enterprise, should suggest that the clause should not stand part of the Bill. Hon. Members may be even more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
surprised to see that the Minister proposes the deletion of all the main clauses and their replacement by two new clauses. The Committee is entitled to an explanation, and I am happy to supply it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1, as I have said, defines what constitutes a common ownership enterprise. A great deal of work was put in by my co-sponsors and myself, with expert consultation outside the House, on producing this clause. One of the problems is that we are dealing with something which is unprecedented. There has been no legislation exactly like this before, which always, to me, seems one of the most exciting and important aspects of our Private Members' Bill procedure It gives hon. Members the opportunity to explore situations of this sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of time, research and effort was put into the drafting of the clause. Inevitably, the more we produced, the more we realised the possibilities for amendment, changes of emphasis in definition and so on. With time to think, which came after the Bill had its Second Reading, the sponsors consulted the Government to see what the attitude would be. The Government's attitude to the Bill had been clearly stated on Second Reading, and, since it was not an unfriendly attitude, the sponsors then consulted the Government as we felt that, with all their resources, they would be able to help us to make the clause even more effective in the light of the deficiencies and queries which had arisen by that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was most happy to accept Government's advice. In the nature of how things work in Parliament, however, inevitably events then moved very quickly, and it was only on Monday evening that I saw the full draft of what the Government were proposing to table, although I had been in consultation with them prior to that. I regret that, because those amendments and new clauses were tabled late on Monday evening, hon. Members on both sides of the Committee were in a difficult situation themselves in seeking to table amendments. I regret that the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) and his hon. Friends, in following normal practice and going along on Monday to table amendments for this morning's proceedings, discovered the proposal to delete Clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
I did not know the final draft until quite late on Monday evening, and I might say that I tabled my own amendments to new Clause 2 almost literally with minutes to spare before the time limit expired. Therefore, it might have been wiser if the new clauses and the proposed deletions had been tabled in my name rather than that of the Minister. However, I hope that the Committee will accept these explanations and that we shall be able to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I, in that respect, suggest that the House—I mean the full House—would wish the Committee to make reasonable progress on the Bill. The Bill is not in a unique situation, but I suggest that it is in a fairly unusual and strong position for a Private Member's Bill in that there was both a full debate and an unopposed Second Reading as well as full debate and an unopposed passage of the Money Resolution, which took place in the early hours of the morning. That is an indication by the House that it would wish to make progress.

I may, perhaps, have gone a little wide in my remarks, Mr. Jones, and I appreciate your leniency in allowing me to do that on the simple Question of "Clause stand part," but I felt that the Committee needed an explanation of the events which have taken place, and which, indeed, led me to move the Sittings motion in the form that I did. I was very happy at the way the Committee accepted it. I express the hope that the Committee will agree that Clause 1 do not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not every day that one hears the promoter of a Bill argue that the main clause should not stand part. I suppose it is not every day, either, that we find a Private Member's Bill with such an amount of good will extended towards it on both sides of the House and getting along quite well until the Government take part. There is a moral there to all of us who introduce Private Member's Bills which seem to have a reason-such an amount of good will extended to-Ministers away from them, particularly, if I may say so—being mildly abrasive—Ministers such as those we have at the moment. Otherwise, the good will begins to disappear at a rapid rate of knots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if one cannot keep the Minister away, at least the great thing to do is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
to hold him back on a leash so that he does not do rather silly things, and particularly that he does not behave as though he were dealing with a Government Bill and trying to play a smart game with the Opposition by keeping them in the dark. It is even worse to play a smart game with his own hon. Friends by keeping them in the dark, too. That sort of behaviour always leads to problems. However, I shall not go farther down that road, because it is not totally relevant to this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may stray mildly on this matter, Mr. Jones, I did not think that Clause 1 was so bad. I certainly observed on Second Reading—
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is perhaps a gulf between us on this."—[	<i>Officials Report,</i> 12th March 1976; Vol 907, c. 874.]</p></blockquote>
but that refers to the matter contained in subsection (4) concerning the disposal of the assets of a common ownership enterprise. No doubt we shall come to that later when we deal with new Clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Trade (Mr. Les. Huckfield)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New Clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. No doubt, we shall come to that, but for my part it is quite clear that the main debate will be on what is in effect a new Bill which has been produced under the guidance and advice of the Government. The main debate will be about the new clauses as they are tabled. I shall not pull the hon. Gentleman's leg to the extent of voting for his clause and leaving him to vote against it. I think we might do well not to pull each other's legs about this matter, but perhaps to debate the substantive matter when we deal with it on the New Clause which, it appears, both the Government and the sponsors of the Bill intend should take the place of the existing clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Committee agrees that I should put
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
the Questions on Clauses 2 and 3 formally, in order to hasten our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should prefer you not to do that, Mr. Jones. I have not thought too deeply about the matter, but it may be that in the new shape of the Bill some matters will not arise again in the same manner as they do on Clauses 2 and 3. It might be for the convenience of the Committee to think a little about this between now and next Wednesday, to decide whether there are any points which may arise on Clauses 2 and 3 and which we would want to introduce into the debate, which we would otherwise have difficulty in doing if we had already disposed of them. That situation may well not arise, and certainly I would not want to use it as a way of delaying the Committee stage of this Bill, but I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have quite an open mind on this matter. The proposal to delete Clauses 2 and 3 arises because these clauses deal with certain financial provisions relating to the conversion of companies, and they are replaced by two clauses which are in the current Finance Bill, upon which Committee I sat in the next Committee room until the early hours of this morning. That is the only reason. If the hon. Gentleman would prefer it, I should be happy not to deal with that matter this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. Perhaps in his time off from the Finance Bill Committee he could come here and tell us what is being decided there on these matters which are included in his Bill and which are of great interest to us in considering what, for the sake of convenience, I shall call the new Bill. We should like to hear from him what is proposed, so that we may see it in the setting of the new Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Price</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that we ought to debate Clause 2, if only briefly, after we have discussed the new clauses. There are certain aspects covered by the clause which I am sure the promoters of this Bill would wish to see preserved and which I do not think is entirely covered in the Government drafting of the new clauses. I am ready to be convinced that these matters are covered, but it seems to me that Clause 2 has a rather important
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
feature in the hon. Gentleman's proposed legislation, which I should have thought it would be a pity for us to drop, namely, the conversion of an existing company into a common ownership company. The Minister may show me later that it is covered, but in my reading last night of the two proposed new clauses I did not see it entirely covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get at cross purposes in dealing with whether Clauses 2 and 3 of the Bill should stand part or not, as compared with New Clause 2 which now becomes the main definitive clause. I take the point that the hon. Gentleman has made. I realise that we must have an in-depth debate on New Clause 2, but Clauses 2 and 3 deal with a rather different aspect of the Bill in relation to certain financial proposals, and we propose to delete them because they are covered in substance in two new clauses of the Finance Bill, whereas New Clause 2 will become the definitive clause as to what constitutes a common ownership entity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate, however, that there is inevitably a great deal of overlapping. It is a slightly difficult situation. Above all, I am not anxious to restrict any debate in the Committee, but it may be a fine balance as to what we car discuss at this stage on these two clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would seem to me to be a tidier way of doing it if we could consider the substantive amendments that are to follow and which may have an effect on Clauses 2, 3 and so on. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman feels that that would put our proceedings in a more orderly fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am entirely in your hands, Mr. Jones, on this matter. We appreciate the dilemma with which you, as well as the Committee, are confronted. Certainly I would be agreeable to your suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a selection which we can continue to honour. The selection can only be changed by the proposal of the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins). That proposal would concern the adjournment of the Committee now and the re-drawing of the selection for our proceedings next Wednesday. It is entirely a matter for the hon. Member to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would your suggestion be that we should deal with New Clauses 1 and 2 and then at the end, if we felt that we had not covered the matters that arise in what I shall call old Clauses 2 and 3, you would be prepared to allow a debate on old Clauses 2 and 3 after New Clauses 1 and 2 had been dealt with? If so, that would seem to be an entirely agreeable way to go about it and would give us time to consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly think of the selection in those terms in an endeavour to see that the affairs of the Committee are put in a rather happier order than we are faced with this morning, in view of the recent amendments that have been tabled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be in order to proceed with New Clauses 1 and 2 and come back to the old clauses, which would have to be renumbered in any case? Could we come back to them at a later stage? Would that be possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that lies behind my proposal. If the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) is agreeable, it would be better if we were to proceed with the Bill in the way that has been proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it possible to deal with Amendment No. 18 which was selected and which deals with a later part of the Bill? This is a relatively uncontroversial matter. On the other hand, if we wish to proceed with the Bill in order, notwithstanding the selection made for this morning's proceedings, that would have to be considered at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not free to amend the selection that we have. We need to go through the formality of the selection and the order of the Bill, so that method is therefore not open to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that we could, if the Committee so wishes, go on to consider Amendment No. 18 this morning?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am sorry. Perhaps I did not make myself clear. We need to proceed in accordance with the selection which is before us. Thus we would need to consider Clauses 1 and 2 stand part, Clause 3 stand part, and so on. We are not free to jump to Amendment No. 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
