	<div class='title'>Clause 37</div> <!-- title -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EXCEPTED EMPLOYMENTS, ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed—</i>[30th March]—No. 44, in page 26, leave out lines 13 and 14.—[	<i>Mr. Dunlop.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) repeated in his final, and moving, speech an example of sectarian cruelty which is utterly deplorable. It might be more deplorable if we were to enforce the removal of religious tests from teachers and destroy the idea of church schools to which his right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) is as attached as I am. The amendment tends towards the secularisation of schools in Northern Ireland and, whatever we may think of this, it is impracticable today. The Under-Secretary was right to say the Bill would not be the appropriate piece of legislation. The amendment might take us into strange company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Mr. Eamonn McCann has urged that the control of education be placed in the hands of popularly-elected committees, ousting the church. The General Secretary of the British Humanist Association, Mr. Ken Furness has urged that subsidies should be withdrawn from sectarian schools and training colleges, and given to non-sectarian schools and training colleges. This was one of six points which included direct rule conducted by a resident minister advised by a community council, including representatives of both wings of the IRA, and the Unification Committee of Northern Ireland—provided the Republic adopted a secular constitution and secular education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lead given by prelates and priests against violence has been both timid, and courageous. To remove the influence of the Catholic Church from the Catholic com-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>438</span>
munity at its roots would be to have a house swept and garnished for subversive take-over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To seek to implement the amendment would place the Roman Catholic Church in conflict with the State which has every right to look for ecclesiastical help in the struggle against those who would replace Catholic with Cuban principles throughout the island of Ireland. There would be fewer outrages of the kind described by the hon. Member for mid-Ulster if Christianity were better taught and Christian teachers were more successful in instilling the theological virtue of charity—which is different from ecumenism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said the amendment exceeds the scope of the Bill. More could be done within the system of which the hon. Gentleman complains to ease relations between Ulster students of different ethnic, cultural and religious traditions. It would be pleasant if, one day, a Northern Ireland Minister could seize the opportunity to report progress towards an agreed and irenic teaching of British and Irish history, legend and literature. No Ulster-man should grow up deprived of the opportunity to understand and enjoy his cultural inheritance. The BBC Schools Service has done something to explain the two cultural groups to each other. This kind of approach is more practicable in achieving what the hon. Gentleman and all of us want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member said that no Ulsterman should be allowed to grow up unaware of the historical background of that part of the British Isles I wonder if he would extend his argument and say that no British citizen ought to grow up without an understanding of that background of a sister island.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully agree. The right hon. Gentleman was making an intervention but I have reached the end of my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) mentions that he was detatched, as was my right hon. Friend the Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) from the situation in Northern Ireland. To some extent both the speeches tend to highlight that attachment. It would be wrong for anyone to believe

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>439</span>
that the segregation of children in schools in Northern Ireland did not in some way contribute to the difficulty people have in living together peaceably. I accept what my right hon. Friend said about the fundamental problems of political allegiance not being solved by integration of education. I am not arguing that integrated education should have as its purpose attempts to coerce children away from what they might think is their ultimate objective. I am concerned children should grow up to learn to live together in Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Belfast West (Mr. Fitt) and I had an interesting experience when a constituent from County Armargh called. He is a keen supporter of the SDLP and employs 75 Roman Catholics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope the hon. Gentleman will explain that he is talking about teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Precisely. I was not suggesting that this person discriminates in selection. He was educated in a Roman Catholic school back-to-back with the State school where I was educated—St. Peter's, Lurgan. We lived virtually in the same street. He told me there was nothing new about this problem, that he used to stone Protestants from the modern school 20 years ago and that I used to stone Catholics from St. Peters. I said "But look at this more deeply. The interesting thing is that the Catholics you would have been with stoned the Protestants from the William Street area of Lurgan because that was a 100 per cent. Protestant area. The Protestants I was with would have stoned the Catholics from the Shankhill Street area which was a 100 per cent. Catholic area. But in the mixed area we came from we did not stone each other. We lived and grew up together and because of the association we did not show antagonism to each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The addition of this amendment would help children to learn that other children were not monsters because of their religious views. They would learn to grow up together. In my heart that is my attitude but my head tells me that the practicalities of life would not let me support this amendment. Ten years ago the majority of people in Northern Ireland would have agreed that integrated education was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>440</span>
desirable. The majority now do not think so. Many Protestants who would have wanted integrated education a short time ago do not want it now. I have sympathy with the amendment but in practice I could not support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One does not see advertisements for teachers for employment in voluntary schools in Northern Ireland. It is generally accepted there will be that element of discrimination in the selection of teachers in voluntary schools and that a Catholic will be appointed to a Catholic school. The converse is not true. The Minister knows that Catholics can apply for positions in, and are appointed in some instances, to State schools. By omitting teachers from the ambit of this Bill we are saying it will be in order for a committee appointing teachers to a State school to discriminate against Catholics. The argument goes that if a majority of children at the school are Protestant why should a Catholic be appointed? Will the Minister indicate whether he has considered this?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an infamous case recently where an SDLP man complained that a young Catholic had been appointed to a school in the West of the Province, and that pressure had been put on her to withdraw. The local committee had appointed her because it thought she was the most suitable applicant. Is the Minister saying that under the Bill pressure could be brought on members of such a committee to discriminate against that person because she was a Catholic yet no action could be taken? That is what concerns me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the outset of the speech of the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) I was wondering if it would have been in order to have a first aid kit because there were so many stones flying around in the hon. Member's attempt to paint a picture of what happens in Northern Ireland. I fully accept the Clause as it stands, without amendment. Education in Northern Ireland is the subject of great debate like other matters. There are both Catholic and Protestant teachers who want immediate change. Some are opposed to any change and some are realistic and accept that any change brought about in the educational system 	<i>vis-a-vis</i> Protestant and Catholic must be gradual. Many of my political opponents in Northern Ireland have repeatedly blamed the segregated school system for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>441</span>
our troubles. I have consistently denied this. It is tragic that young people, because of historical and religious differences are exploited and are not permitted to go to the same school. Even within the Catholic Church a great debate is going on. There are progressive members of the Catholic Church who want to see progressive steps taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In accepting this clause as it stands we are not asking that every teacher should be excluded from the provisions of the legislation. We want the debate to continue. During the short period of the Executive certain members of my Party allied with others. We had taken the first tentative steps towards the creation of pilot schemes to see whether integration would be possible—recognising all the difficulties—in rural areas, where the conditions are not so difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most interesting comments in the debate was by the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee). He said
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"I think it is right that the tragic division of education in Northern Ireland between Catholic and Protestant exists—a typically Northern Irish division, if hon. Members of Northern Ireland constituencies will allow me—because while it is recognised publicly that there are Catholic schools, it is not recognised publicly that there are Protestant schools. Protestant schools are State schools. The State is Protestant, or is designed to be, and there was therefore no need to call them Protestant schools."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 30th March 1976; c 428.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman now says, and he says it in language that we can all understand, that the Northern Ireland State is Protestant and that therefore the State schools are Protestant schools. This is completely in line with sentiments expressed by the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, when he said "This is a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people". Throughout all the years since then, people have said "It was a mistake; he did not mean it that way. You have taken it up wrongly." But the facts of life in Northern Ireland have been such as to ensure that there had to be two streams of education, one almost exclusively Protestant and the other almost ex-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>442</span>
clusively Catholic. It is not the fault of the teaching profession in Northern Ireland that we have these divisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both Catholic and Protestant teachers, given our sad history and the ghetto system which exists, particularly in the urban areas—Catholic ghettoes and Protestant ghettoes—have carried a great responsibility in trying, sometimes successfully, but sometimes not so successfully, to prevent their pupils from becoming involved in our political disturbances. They have carried out a most difficult task at a most difficult period in the history of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the reality—and I refer again to what has been said publicly in this Committee by the right hon. Member for Wokingham—is that there are Catholic schools and Protestant schools, and when the State of Northern Ireland first came into being it was created on a head count—65 per cent. Protestant and 35 per cent. Catholic. This is what has brought about this type of legislation, and this is why we are discussing this clause. I sometimes wonder whether the criticisms of the voluntary school system are genuine. I take it that the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) who moved the amendment is deeply and sincerely concerned about trying to eradicate whatever evil there may be in our segregated system. But there are others who cry crocodile tears about the system. If the Catholic Church or the voluntary school managers were to have a change of mind, and say that they would take steps to abolish the voluntary school system there would be a tremendous outcry from managers of Protestant schools. One recognises their criticism for what it is—grossly insincere and dishonest. I suggest that the clause as it stands does not preclude the Government or the agency from taking steps, when they consider the time appropriate, to include professional teachers within the ambit of this legislation. I would certainly agree with those who have advocated caution, because this is a very difficult subject. I certainly support the clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to have a ministerial view on this matter? This has been an important debate, and I had hoped that the Government would have thought it sufficiently important to sum it up, however briefly, even though
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>443</span>
I assume, subject to your ruling Madam Chairman, we shall be returning, on the Question that the clause stand part, to some aspects of this subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary dealt with the amendment on Tuesday, and I see no reason to reply at this stage to a clause stand part debate. They are interesting points but they have nothing to do with this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I stated my case rather imperfectly on Tuesday. In view of what the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) said, may I say that I was not advocating the total elimination of religious education from the lives of young people, generated through schools or otherwise. What I said was that religion is a problem for those who teach and it should be their job. However, I do not want to enter into that at any great length this morning. Sufice it to say that, in view of the views expressed by my hon. Friends and the Minister's statement, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 45, in page 26, line 14, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>' (	<i>d</i>) employment by a political organisation '.</p></q>
This amendment is self-explanatory and that is the best kind of amendment. I do not know whether the headquarters of the SDLP employs a cleaner, but if it does I would not expect it to employ one without having regard to the political opinions of that person. Similarly, I would not expect Ulster Unionists not to have regard to the political opinions of the kind man who unpadlocks and re-padlocks the gate, to allow entry to and exit from 3 Glengall Street. One would surely not expect the selection of such employees to be made not exclusively on occupational merit, but with some regard to political opinions and affiliations. No political organisation could expect to lay open its secrets to employees who, however estimable and good at their job, might be political opponents. It seems to me that in employing men or women a political organization
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>444</span>
has every right to provide employment to those who share its political opinions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. J. D. Concannon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 37 follows closely the recommendations of the working party that there should be no general exemption from the provisions of the Bill, except where religion is a 	<i>bona fide</i> occupational qualification, apart from certain special categories of employment which the working party specified. Where a political organisation can show that the essential nature of a job requires it to be done by a person holding a particular religious belief or political opinion, the job will be exempt by virtue of subsections (2) and (3) of the clause. Where that cannot be shown, there seems to be no reason why political organisations ought to be exempt. Indeed, it can be strongly argued that political organisations, as leaders of the respective communities in Northern Ireland, should categorically eschew religious or political discrimination, except where the essential nature of the job requires it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the Parliamentary Secretary has apprehended the nature of the difficulty to which the argument—whether or not the amendment is the right way of dealing with it—of the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) is directed. The difficulty turns upon the essential nature of the job. I quite understand that if we are talking about an agent of a political party the essential nature of the job, to all reasonable people, requires that he should be an adherent of that political party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not always so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will have to take the blame if he leads me on to reflections into byways which I have not even noticed, let alone felt a temptation to enter. But let me take a clear example. I wonder whether a court could find that the essential nature of the job of a shorthand typist, even a junior, required her to be an adherent, not merely of unionism with a small 'u', but of a particular political opinion. Indeed, it might be more undesirable that she should be a Faulknerite, if such people still exist—I do not know; I have not met one in Northern
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>445</span>
Ireland for a long time past, but I put the case hypothetically—than that she should be an adherent or a sympathiser of the SDLP. So there is a real difficulty here. It may be that the proper way to meet it is by attending, at a subsequent stage of the Bill, to that which is attempted at present by the term
	<br><q><p>"the essential nature of the job".</p></q>
I ask the Government to recognise that if
	<br><q><p>"the essential nature of the job"</p></q>
are words which are given their natural meaning, they will exclude not merely the man who locks and unlocks the gate at 3 Glengall Street, not merely the cleaners who go in and out, presumably outside office hours, but people who are doing jobs essentially the same as they would be doing in a commercial firm or in the office of an opposing political party, but whose sensitivity—to give way to a common misuse of that term in the political context—is clear enough. So I wonder whether we can have some more help and probably the hon. Member for Epping Forest feels the same—from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we were trying to do was to say that we recognise that this is a sensitive area. Those jobs which require to be done by persons holding political or religious beliefs will, of course, be covered by parts of this clause. If the typist in the example given by the right hon. Gentleman was employed in typing sensitive material, the exemption would cover her. It all depends on the facts and, at the end of the day, it would be for the agency to decide. But if organisations, bodies or Government Departments were employing typists in work on sensitive material, it is intended that they would be caught by this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to prolong this debate, and the Government have at least understood the nature of the problem. But I feel doubtful whether, without some improvement in the wording—and perhaps that will enable us to return to this at a later stage—we can have a satisfactory result. The Under-Secretary referred to sensitive material, but it is most undesirable that, within the kind of organisations we are all familiar with, we should have a kind of classification into "trusties" and "non-trusties". All
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>446</span>
hon. Members know perfectly well what is the atmosphere in the office of a politicial organisation. The atmosphere is such that trust and cordiality prevails from top to bottom, and there is something seriously wrong if it does not. I do not believe that the agency or a court would find it either practicable or reasonable to start investigating the kind of accounts or the kind of letters that a certain typist was commonly required to type. We shall have time to look at this again, and we are indebted to the official Opposition for specifically drawing attention to this problem. But the Government ought to be considering whether some qualification, such as the essential nature of the job or the circumstances in which it is performed—again, I am not trying to draft on my feet—will be needed at some later stage. I hope that we shall be able to come back to this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We belong to political parties and we all understand the difficulties about this Bill. But we think that we have got the wording right and that it is adequate. However, if it will help, and without prejudging the issue, we shall endeavour to look at it to see whether it is right and whether it covers the problems that might exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another point which the Under-Secretary of State might consider, apart from the categories of employment which have been mentioned in connection with this amendment. I refer to the right of a political organisation in certain circumstances to reward loyalty or good service with employment. This is another reason why it was right to put down the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for what the Under-Secretary has said, and, on the understanding that it is to be closely looked at again before the next stage of the Bill, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>—	<i>[Mr. Powell.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an excellent and very full debate on this most important clause. Experts on the Opposition side have dealt with different fairly obscure matters. As I endeavoured to say on Tuesday, there is a case for looking at Clause 37 as a whole and asking whether it is quite adequate. Will it be understood by those to whom it is applied and by whom it is supposed to be understood?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three occupations listed in subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) could well have been plucked out of the air for all the relevance they have to the many different facets of life in Northern Ireland. If the clause is to hold water and be intelligible to ordinary people in Northern Ireland, which is surely the intention, there must be some addition to the general interpretation clause, Clause 57.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the general interpretation clause, schools—the subject of one of the three exemptions in Clause 37(1)—are defined, but when the Bill reaches the statute book it will be wide open for misinterpretation, deliberate or inadvertent, when there is no definition of a private household. It may well be that members of the Committee—at any rate on the Government side—have a perfectly clear view of who is and who is not in a private household, of what a private household consists, and of what it does not consist, but it appears to me to be very obscure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That obscurity is aggravated when we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>448</span>
find that simple English—as the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) pointed out—is not used. Instead of saying in subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>) "employment in a household", or "employment in a private household", it is made even worse by the use of the words
	<br><q><p>"employment for the purposes of a private household".</p></q>
Not only are ordinary lay members of the Committee in difficulty in understanding what is meant by "private household". We are in even greater difficulty in trying to apprehend what is meant by
	<br><q><p>"for the purposes of a private household".</p></q>
I imagine that in Northern Ireland—where the Bill will, I expect, apply one day—people will be asking whether a milkman delivering milk to a private household is employed
	<br><q><p>"for the purposes of a private household".</p></q>
If the clause read "employed in a private household", quite obviously a delivery man would not be exempt, but as the provision reads at present I imagine that it will be strongly maintained that anyone delivering milk or papers, or a window cleaner or electrician, may be regarded as being in
	<br><q><p>"employment for the purposes of a private household".</p></q>
If subsection (l)(	<i>b</i>) is not intended to be as wide as that, it ought to be tightened up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said already that there should be an addition to Clause 57 to interpret "private household". One would assume—but again one is working in the realm of mythology in doing so—that a gardener, as an employee, is in
	<br><q><p>"employment for the purposes of a private household"</p></q>
and would therefore be exempt. But what about the many contract gardeners who ply their trade, not just in one private household but in a number of private households which maintain those gardeners on a weekly basis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position when the private household is a farmhouse? I would wager that there are more farmhouses per thousand of the population in Northern Ireland than anywhere else in the British Isles. If a farmhouse is classed as a private household for the purposes of the Bill, are farm workers exempt from the provisions of Clause 37(1)(	<i>b</i>)?I have illustrated some of the difficulties
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>449</span>
of interpreting subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>), and I regret that there is not an interpretation of a private household in Clause 57. The exemption in subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) relates to
	<br><q><p>"any employment or occupation as a clergyman or minister of a religious denomination",</p></q>
This definition is most obscure. There is no definition of "religious denomination" in the interpretation clause. Therefore again one is groping around in the realms of mythology—just as others will be when the Bill reaches the statute book—to understand what is meant by subsection (1)(a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to be irreverent in any way, but does any religious Tom, Dick or Harry qualify? Does a minister of any religion, however obscure and however ill-supported, qualify for the exemption? On the other hand, is it intended that the exemption in subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) shall apply only to those associated with what we might loosely call the major religions in Northern Ireland? The Committee may look confused, but I do not think that hon. Gentlemen opposite can give me the answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put it bluntly, would the subsection apply, for instance, to the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) and to the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Mr. Bradford)? This is a matter of some obscurity at the moment and it could most easily be solved if the general definition clause, Clause 57, were to be amended to include some simple words such as "for the purposes of the Bill a religious denomination shall consist of the following churches", and then giving (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed the application of the clause to those in newspaper employment. It is strange that there should be any question but that a person engaged as an employee of the 	<i>Protestant Telegraph,</i> the 	<i>Irish News—</i>or indeed 	<i>The Tablet</i> or the 	<i>Church of Ireland Gazette—</i>should be exempt from the application of the Bill. Obviously, in order to do their job in a way favourable to those with whom they are associated, and with whom their publications are associated, they must be thinking about their task and thinking of their religion at the time they write and prepare the printing presses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand the wish of the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop), expressed in his excellent amendment, to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>450</span>
have subsection (1)(	<i>c</i>) removed, and to lift the exemption for those who are employed as teachers in a school. In the short time that I have known him, I have come to respect his beliefs, and I recognise that he has many years of experience. But I respectfully suggest to him that what he suggests is quite beyond the bounds of possibility at this moment in Northern Ireland. It is a sort of Wonderland for which everybody in Northern Ireland is searching. We all want to see the time when children can go to interdenominational schools, with no religious bias one way or the other, but that time is, regrettably, generations off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is naive for the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) to suggest that at this moment we could even consider removing the exemption for teachers. The right hon. Gentleman said yesterday that he felt that it was essential to decide whether we wanted to begin to deal with the problems in Northern Ireland. He said that he felt, after careful consideration, that we were tackling the problems in the right way and that a start should be made towards a political solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has not been in Northern Ireland very long. He is not an Ulsterman, any more than I am, although I have lived there more years than he. There is a fundamental difficulty which prevents any form of non-denominational education taking place in Northern Ireland. It is the fear amongst all parents of Protestant children of the laws on mixed marriage in the Catholic Church, meaning that a child of a mixed marriage is by edict brought up as a Catholic. They will not allow their children to mix with Catholic children because they may later marry. It is as simple as that. All the other hon. Members from Northern Ireland constituencies know that that is the case and the right hon. Gentleman will learn that it is. The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster knows that also. That basic belief exists and that is where the alteration must be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>451</span>
that within a mixed community, with marriages taking place and children being brought up as Catholics, Protestants will be outbred. It is no good the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster appealing for this airy-fairy land which does not exist in Northern Ireland and which never can until the Roman Catholic Church changes the game.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear when I indicated that there would be a "clause stand part" debate that that did not mean that hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am mindful of your admonition, Mrs. Jeger, but I wish to make a brief comment. Why is there this fear of being outbred? The numerical significance is a political significance. It is the political majority that is feared because it would be altered by outbreeding. I do not know which is the 	<i>Poisson d'Avril</i> —the April Fool—but it seems to me that the argument of the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) proved my case—that the ultimate starting point is political and that however important religion is, it is, in this sense, subordinate to politics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for Down, South for that intervention but it is not very helpful. I know that he is misguided and I believe, although I am not convinced, that he is well-intentioned. When he has had the benefit of associating more with his colleagues from Northern Ireland, I think that he will change his views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of detaining the Committee, but I am forced to intervene again because of the illustration which the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) drew to the attention of the Committee. He mentioned the imaginary case of a girl typist and a political organisation. A girl could be prevented from taking up a position with a political organisation, and that would in some way be understandable, but it opens up further the possibility that an employer who is a member of a political organisation in his private life could refuse to employ a person of a different political
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>452</span>
affiliation. That is relevant to this and other clauses. On Tuesday we went over the same ground about Catholics and Protestants and on that day, perhaps at the time when we were discussing the matter in Committee, a young girl stenographer in Belfast rang up the local employment exchange in Belfast, which is known as Gloucester House. She asked whether there were any vacancies and she was given the name of and address a firm. She applied and the first question asked of her was "Are you a Catholic?' She said that she had been a Catholic but did not attach any significance to that any longer. She also said that she was married to a British soldier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She was told in unequivocal terms that the firm employed only protestants. Was that a political rejection and was the person politically motivated? My right hon. Friend will have to apply himself to that case. The firm concerned was a prominent firm of Solicitors with three major partners. It is with difficulty that I resist the tempation to name the firm as its action proves the necessity for the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am finding it difficult to relate what the hon member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) is saying to Clause 37. I must remind him that the amendments to which he has referred have been withdrawn after an undertaking by the Minister. He should be dealing only with accepted amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. Your ruling puts the Government in some difficulty. A case has been publicly raised in Committee and I have since taken certain action which I should like to explain briefly to the Committe. I have invited the person concerned to come to the Department of Manpower so that the Government can consider the alleged wrong doing. The meeting will take place tomorrow morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The connection between this case and Clause 37 remains arcane. I hope the hon. Gentleman will not pursue it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

his status, as a leader of a denomination but marriages are solomnised in his Church and are accepted. If Muhammed Ali, the world heavyweight champion, came to live in Northern Ireland and sought to propagate his religion—he claims to be the head of the Black Muslims—he would also be accepted in the same category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that at such a late stage a note of rancour has been introduced into the debate by the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr). I will only say this, which is not rancorous, although some of us were on our feet in the House until a late hour this morning: however long I represent a seat in Northern Ireland, and I hope to do so so long as my political life lasts, I personally will never substitute religious difference for political difference; nor will I countenance that where I can avoid it. During my election many people drew attention to the fact that I never used the words "Protestant" and "Catholic." I never used them because I was appealing to the people on political grounds and speaking to them as a politician. If that is to be ignorant and ill-intentioned, I am willing to remain ignorant and ill-intentioned so long as I retain a seat there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, apart from the minor question of the definition of a private household, no reference has been made to the important contents of subsection (4), the rate at which the Bill's provisions—equality of opportunity as well as discrimination—will extend over the whole field of employment, down from the larger to the smaller employers. I do not believe that the Minister will disagree that we are setting a fast pace in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). It means not only at the outset, but even more in years two and three that tact, discrimination and a sense of the practicable and the difference between the productive and counter-productive will have to be exercised very acutely by the agency and the Department of Employment will have to be especially alive to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman relieved some of the fears of the Committee earlier by giving convincing evidence. We may worry about the practicalities but we are no longer worried about the intentions of avoiding anything that could be mistaken for quotas or for any numerical interpretation of the conditions of the Bill.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>454</span>
The difficulties, as we go down to the 25, tens and below tens is that the numerical aspect is going to become even more startlingly visible. The numerical balance might have a different significance for small employers than for a firm employing 500 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a firm is employing 500 people and 400 are Roman Catholics that may mean something quite different from the fact that in a firm employing five people four were Roman Catholics. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman is aware that the inherent difficulties in this legal, if not legalistic, approach to the whole problem are magnified the smaller are the firms to which it is applied, as also are the dangers of personal friction. After all, in a large firm with personnel officers, especially personnel officers of the ability, experience and goodwill of the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) these matters can be dealt with, even by the intervention of the agency, without the general current of feeling and activity in the firm being disturbed. It will not be like that if the firm is employing 20, or even more, if the firm is employing 5 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman may even welcome the opportunity to make some reference to subsection (4) and to how he sees the working of subsection (4) in the context of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is a small one though it is rather more than a drafting point. I understand the significance in this clause of "a particular political opinion". I am more worried about the significance in the context of this clause of "a particular religious belief" which occurs in subsection (2) because in the appointment of teachers there may be justifiable discrimination between persons of religious belief and persons of no religious belief. Of course, the definition clause, Clause 57 includes the holding of no religious belief along with a religious belief. I can quite envisage circumstances in which this Committee would think it undesirable in due course that "particular religious belief" should be a ground of discrimination but still think it unreasonable to deny to school managers the right to discriminate between the militant proselytising atheist and a teacher of religious belief, whether that religious belief was Roman Catholic or otherwise. Perhaps that is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>455</span>
another point which, either in connection with the definition clause or this clause, the right hon. Gentleman may ask his advisers to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Madam Chairman, I seek your guidance before attempting to proceed. I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) for once again paving the way for me on subsection (4) of Clause 37. I tried to raise a specific case and it was taken to be in relation to teachers. I think I am on safe ground now in referring to this subsection, and perhaps opening up the case I was attempting to illustrate earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this clause a person who has fewer than 25 employees will not be caught under this Act. I instance again a solicitor's office. It would be a very big solicitor's office that would have more than 25 employees. Most of the legal establishments in Northern Ireland outside of the High Court would have staffs not exceeding 25 persons. In the case I illustrated that means under the present state of this legislation those persons would be able to indulge in the type of discrimination I have already outlined. The agency could not do anything for the first three years and, if it had fewer than 10 employees, it would even escape for much longer. If this Bill means what it says and is trying to erase the cancer of religious and political discrimination in Northern Ireland, it means that some people will be in a very fortunate position for three years. The particular firm, which I will not name, will be in the position of being able to say "We will recruit only Protestant staff and we will not consider taking into our employment a person who is a Catholic, no matter how loyal that Catholic may be".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) and I took part in a television programme on Monday, the day before this girl was refused a job. I think the hon. Gentleman should have got an Oscar for the valiant attempt he made trying to defend the indefensible and the attitude to this legislation in this Committee and throughout Northern Ireland. I do not think he succeeded, nor was he entitled to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend will bring that girl to the local office tomorrow morning and she will confirm what I have said this morning. Yet my right hon. Friend is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>456</span>
absolutely powerless to do anything because this legislation is not on the statute book and even if it was he would not be able to do anything for three years. In the meantime there may be many hundreds of cases such as the one I have illustrated. I wonder if there is anything, even at this late stage, or any representations which could be made to that firm of solicitors to make it change its attitude. There are other firms in Northern Ireland which have a staff of less than 25. I support this clause because it deals mainly with the teaching profession but I do have reservations because in the case I have illustrated there seems to be absolutely no protection given for the next three years to persons who are not given employment because of their religion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to help the Committee. It is in order to discuss the proposition in the clause that firms employing fewer than 25 people should be exempted. I would also point out that no amendments were tabled suggesting a change to that figure. I hope the Committee will not pursue too closely one individual case which the Minister has promised to look into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>. I would simply add that I hope the Minister will be even-handed in his approach to trying to eliminate the sort of practice demonstrated to us this morning. I would not in any way defend solicitors who behave in the way which has been described any more than I would try to defend the person I mentioned who employed 57 Roman Catholics and no Protestants. Perhaps the Minister could call him down to have a chat with him to see whether something could be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope from what I have said to the Committee that hon. Members will understand I am not prejudging this case. I want this lady to give evidence to my Department. Until then no action can be taken. I hope we can leave the matter there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since I last spoke my case has been substantially strengthened by what the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) said. He quoted in support from what the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) said. That was that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>457</span>
theoretically we have a Church educational system and a State educational system but in practice it is a Protestant and a Catholic educational system. The difference is that while the State educational system may be a Protestant educational system it is forced to behave as if it was a State educational system. The hon. Gentleman will have observed in the 	<i>Irish News,</i> and I have observed in the 	<i>Belfast Newsletter</i> over the past weeks, lists of vacancies for employment in State schools throughout Northern Ireland from one side to the other. There were full pages of advertisements for State schools, or in the hon. Gentleman's words for Protestant schools. But I have not seen lists of vacancies for jobs in the Catholic schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect what we are doing is giving an advantage to Catholic teachers because they have the opoortunity—I do not know how it is done—of knowing what vacancies exist in the Catholic school system whereas the Protestant teacher does not. In the Western region of Northern Ireland we have an education committee with a majority of Catholics on it. I believe even the director of education in the Western region is Roman Catholic. We could have Roman Catholic teachers being appointed to what the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) has called Protestant schools. There was a classic case over the past two weeks to which I have already referred. What I am concerned about is that if we are to except there is a Protestant and Catholic education system we should not expect the Protestant education system to behave as if it was a State educational system. The Under-Secretary argued that, in effect, there are two separate systems. I am arguing that if this is the case they should be expected to behave in precisely the same manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate on clause stand part got off to a rather tricky start but basically there are two points that have been raised with any substance, namely those about private households and the employment of teachers in schools, and latterly a most important point which came out about subsection (4). On the three exemptions what we have to say is that we think they are necessary. We have to keep them to the bare minimum. I have no difficulty in understanding the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>458</span>
term "private household". All the things which the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) mentioned are covered. The charlady, as he mentioned, is clearly employed for that purpose by a private household and is exempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However a man delivering milk does so for the purpose of his employment and he will be covered because he is employed as a milkman. Of course, if the hon. Gentleman wants to define private households which have never been defined in other Acts, he has the opportunity of tabling an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for subsection (4), as the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) said, this is a matter of practicalities. Subsection (4) provides for the phased assumption of responsibilities by the agency by exempting firms of 25 or fewer employees for the first two years after enactment and firms of 10 or less for three years after enactment. Based on the latest figures available, which are those contained in the June 1974 Census of Employment, there are a total of 31,000 establishments employing 494,000 workers with 3,700 establishments, employing 67,400 workers having between 11 and 25 workers and a further 24,600 establishments, employing 74,600 workers, having 10 or fewer workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is tremendous scope but the problem is the sheer practicalities of the Bill and the work-load involved in putting into the Bill the number of firms and people employed. I want everybody to understand that the problems we have been talking about will be caught up in time. The hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) was a little worried about the status of schools. Whatever is in the Bill it does not alter the situation at this time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always spoken in general terms. I have never said that State schools are 100 per cent. Protestant. If there is a situation in any area, this Bill

will not alter it one way or another. I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that. We have had wide-ranging discussion on Clause 37.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be grateful if the Minister would refer to two points in connection with this clause. I take the first one for granted because at an earlier stage the right hon. Gentleman generously indicated his willingness to look at the drafting of the Bill to ensure that the terminology was, as far as possible, uniform. He will not mind if I draw his attention, by way of example in this clause to the difference between steps that should be taken and steps that ought to be taken. That and other inconcinnities—a word which occurred to me in the watches of the night—will be discovered by those more expert than I in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the second point. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will wish to give us an assurance on this. It is an anxiety renewed by the terminology of sub-section (2). At a previous sitting the right hon. Gentleman was categoric that no investigation, in his view, that the authority was authorised or directed to undertake ought to result in employers being required to keep registers of religious affiliation. He went so far as to say that he separated sharply his intentions in the Bill and in administration from what was envisaged in so many terms in the Working Party Report. In sub-section (2) we have instructions to the agency which might well be interpreted as requiring or implying the compilation by those managing schools of registers of teachers showing against those teachers their respective religion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman's intentions in this respect are the same as they were when we dealt with this matter earlier. Since this is a separate provision
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>460</span>
and raises the matter again in the context of schools—the sensitivity of which has been clear from the preceding debate—I hope he will not mind if I invite him to comment again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate which has preceded this one has made it possible not merely to argue the case for this amendment more briefly than would otherwise have been practicable but it has also deployed many of the arguments for it in graphic form. Looking at subsection (1) as it stands, it enables the Secretary of State, by simple order—there are the usual safeguards about the implementation—to do one of two things. One is to limit the classes of schools and teachers who are excluded by Clause 37.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point concerns the taking of schools right out of the exceptions in Clause 37. My submission is that whereas it is reasonable, and we hope it will prove practicable, for the right hon. Gentleman or his successor at some time to proceed piecemeal, particularly in the State sector to erode the blanket exception in Clause 37(1)(	<i>c</i>) it is something far too important to allow by mere ministerial order elimination of the school system altogether—voluntary and State—from the exception in Clause 37. Let us envisage what would be involved if the power in Clause 39(1)(	<i>a</i>)
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>461</span>
were used. We would have a debate lasting a maximum of one-and-a-half hours at an early hour in the morning upon an action, frought with undoubled difficulties, dangers and differences of opinion. I submit that this is something which ought only to be done by legislation. Having legislated into the Bill the exception of the schools, it is reasonable for us to allow this category to be eroded by successive ministerial orders. But it is bad legislation, on what is a matter of fundamental principle, and this was common ground between the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) and I, to say that this provision can be wiped out of the legislation by ministerial order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) strengthened the case for leaving out subsection (	<i>a</i>). He was pointing out that in the State sector, which is subject to the administrative control and influence of the Department quite apart from this Bill there is the employment of persons of different religious denominations and that just because there is that variety of employment there is the real possibility of unjustifiable discrimination, that there are sensitivities and dangers which bring that sector of the schools in Northern Ireland firmly within the purport, intentions and philosophy of this Bill. It seems, therefore, that we ought to permit the Government to identify areas and deal with them as they do so, subject to the control of Parliament over delegated legislation. We have no objection to Clause 39(1)(	<i>b</i>) but we appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to recognise that Clause 39(1)(	<i>a</i>) is something altogether too large and too distant to be provided for by simple ministerial order. This is one of the moments—and I am making no complaint—where I miss the assistance of the hon. Gentleman for Belfast, West who would have been on my side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not detain the Committee for more than a minute. Before the hon. Gentleman replies, I would recall to his memory what he said in an earlier debate—that it was not appropriate to use this Bill to introduce a non-segregated system of education. It would not be appropriate to change the education system of Northern Ireland by order of the Secretary of State. Any such change should be subject to lengthy discussion and wide agreement in a separate Education Bill.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>462</span>
I have misgivings about the clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The misgivings I expressed earlier are strengthened by this clause. I said earlier that my heart lay in the direction of integrated education. Following this debate I am being driven farther from that. I have defended the appointment of a Roman Catholic as a director of education even though he was not prepared to send his own children to be educated in the system he was administering; I also defended the appointment of a deputy director who was not prepared to send his children to be educated in the system he was administering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.00 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was prepared to argue that Roman Catholic children should be encouraged to attend State schools, but after the discussion today I may have to reconsider my position. I say very strongly that I totally disagree with paragraph (	<i>a</i>), and I have severe reservations about paragraph (	<i>b</i>), because we know that paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is likely to be applied in the State sector. If there is to be any loosening, it will be in the sector over which the Government have control. This will give strength to the bigots who argue contrary to the view I took in the past, and unfortunately, from now on, I shall tend to be on their side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not tried to conceal the fact that this is one of the areas where we have departed slightly from the Working Party's Report. This was due to considerable pressure upon us from all sections of the community in Northern Ireland—from the churches, the schools, the education authorities and all kinds of other organisations. Public opinion is, to some extent, responsible for this clause and for swaying our opinion in this case. All we are saying is that Amendment No. 144 is designed to limit the power of the Secretary of State in this respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards Clause 39, there may well be a situation where the Secretary of State wishes to remove the exemptions in full and not piecemeal. But no Secretary of State would do that without testing public opinion at the time, and making sure that the temperature was absolutely right,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>463</span>
and subsection (5) provides:
	<br><q><p>"The Secretary of State shall not make an order under subsection (1) unless a draft of the order has been laid before, and has been approved by, both Houses of Parliament ".</p></q>
So I assure hon Gentlemen that, before any Secretary of State attempted to use this provision, he would be very careful that the temperature and the time were right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather disappointed by the Under-Secretary's response and, without at all wishing to appear obdurate, I find that his concluding remarks strengthen the case for saying that if this is to be done at all, it should in due course be done by legislation. I cannot believe that the hon. Gentleman can put his hand on his heart and say that one and a half hours' debate is adequate for what, in effect, as the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mr. Biggs-Davison) said, is a fundamental change of the school system—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this I agree with the hon. Member for Epping Forest. But that ought not to be brought about by a move to approve an order in an hour and a half, even if it happens in their Lordships' House as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that this is fundamental, because the very essence of a religious voluntary school is that it is maintained in order that parents may be sure of their children being educated in the environment of that religious persuasion. Therefore, if an order is made under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) it will become impracticable, and the purpose will be to make it impracticable, to maintain such a school in which the staff are all imbued with the religious outlook of a particular denomination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I insist that the hon. Member for Epping Forest was not exaggerating when he said that an order made under Clause 39(1)(	<i>a</i>) in effect meant the elimination in the circumstances of Northern Ireland of the present bipartite—I use that as the most colourless word I can find—system of education. Here I am appealing to the hon. Member for Belfast West (Mr. Fitt). I just say that it is bad legislation to contemplate that, however far in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>464</span>
future, that should be done by Ministerial order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course there would be soundings of public opinion before the Minister laid such an order; that goes without saying. But, in the last resort, we are the people who are responsible to public opinion for the change which is made in the law of the land, and if we are to be responsible on so important a matter as this we must have a full panoply of legislation for doing it. One day there will no doubt be a Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) (Amendment) Bill laid before the House for this purpose or for some other, and, if the Government of the day wish to propose it, let them do it then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will bear me out when I say that my hon. Friends and I have bent over backwards to facilitate the carrying on of government under the legislative difficulties which the present constitutional anomalies create. We have not only been co-operative in our intention, but have perhaps laid ourselves open to criticism by being willing to assist the process of legislation under existing powers. So when I put this as strongly as I am putting it to the right hon. Gentleman I hope that he and his colleagues will not say "This is just ordinary opposition. This is just the ordinary case of an Opposition trying to take Ministerial powers of legislation by order out of a statute". It is not that at all. This is clearly a special case and one which stands on its own merits, and I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to think again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He is losing nothing and is gaining something. He is losing nothing because it will not be in his time, or the time of the next Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, that such an order under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) will be proposed. But he is gaining something in that he will not have a Bill which people can point to and say "Do you realise there is only an hour and a half on the Floor of the House of Commons on a Ministerial order between you and the abolition, in effect, of Roman Catholic schools as they are envisaged and intended? There is only that barrier between you and their disappearance". I do not think that he would wish a line to remain in the Bill which not merely bears that interpretation but has that interpretation. So I ask him to think again and I hope, as I said in his

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that acceptance of the argument which has been put forward by the right hon. Gentleman and by myself follows from what the Under-Secretary of State himself has said already in Committee. I beg him to think very carefully before placing himself and the Government in conflict with those who accept the concept of a church school—a concept which has been correctly stated by the right hon. Gentleman. It would be very unwise and very wrong to do that, and for the Minister of State to say from a sedentary position that it would not be to change the whole system of religious education in denominational schools to insist that they take on teachers without regard to their religious opinions, does not seem to me to be in conformity with the realities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is twisting the argument completely around. We are not faced with this possiblity. The clause that we have just passed exempted changes in this regard, and we accepted that there was a strong weight of opinion in Northern Ireland that teachers should be included among these exemptions. What we are saying is that if this is to be altered, it will be done by affirmative motion by the Secretary of State. In our opinion, it would not change the basis of religion in Northern Ireland. It relates specifically to teachers as such, and we do not know when we shall arrive at that posi-</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would ask the Minister of State to listen to the argument that is being deployed from this side of the Committee. It is not a minor matter to insist by order that employment as a teacher in a Roman Catholic school should no longer be decided on the religious belief of the teacher. I know a number of Roman Catholic schools which very sensibly employ non-Catholic teachers, just as they take in children who are not Catholic, with full respect to the consciences of the children and their parents, and of course this is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very large matter even if the right hon. Gentleman does not understand how we feel about it. What we are asking is that, if such a great change is to be made in the education system, if the concept of a church school as it exists today is to be rejected by a Government, it is only right that that Government should come to the House of Commons, or to the appropriate Legislature, to put through the legislation they desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 5, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>Perhaps I may at the same time, ask the Under-Secretary for some wider clarification. Apart from the words which I move to omit, the clause exempts from the mischief of the Bill provisions conferring benefits on persons of a particular religious or political opinion which are made for exclusively charitable purposes.</p>
	<p>This seems to my hon. Friends and myself, as it clearly did to the Government,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>467</span>
to be reasonable in principle, that we should not by this Bill undo the intentions of charities which are not contrary to the public interest—because, of course, if they were contrary to the public interest, they could not be sustained under the general law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with charitable provisions which are not contrary to the public interest and which have been deliberately made for the benefit of a political party or a religious denomination. Quite rightly, we are taking those out of the ambit of the Bill. But why should we only take them out of the ambit of the Bill if those provisions are made in an enactment or instrument which does nothing else? It seems to me that they are just as charitable, just as much within the definition and the argument, if the enactment did other things as well, as if this were the sole purpose of the particular enactment or instrument. I am, therefore, genuinely puzzled by the necessity for these words. They seem to me to be unreasonably restricted. If the purpose of the provision is charitable, I should have thought that ought to be the end of the matter, however many other matters have been tied up with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps, at the same time, I might ask the right hon. Gentleman to explain whether the law of Northern Ireland in this respect so differs from the law of Great Britain, or of England or of Scotland, that this exception has to be limited to purposes which are charitable according to the law of Northern Ireland. For example, it seems to me possible that there could be an English charity established under the law of England which, nevertheless, would benefit persons of certain religious persuasion in Northern Ireland. It seems to me entirely probable that there are common charitable foundations which maintain institutions for the benefit of particular religious beliefs in Northern Ireland, as well as on this side of the water. I cannot for the life of me think why those should not have the benefit of the exclusion which Clause 40 confers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hope and expectation is that these difficulties arise from a failure of comprehension on the part of my hon. Friends and myself, and that therefore the Under-Secretary will be able to remove them.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>468</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like, if I can, to clear up what is bothering the right hon. Gentleman. The wording of the subsection, as drafted, is necessary to make clear what "provisions" the clause relates to, otherwise "provision" would be ambiguous and the scope of the clause unclear. The effect of the clause is that any charitable provision is covered if it is contained in any instrument or any private or public Act. The amendment would not widen the scope of the clause, because the clause is drafted in the widest terms. It would only make the provision obscure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The application of the clause is dependent on whether the instrument in question is charitable according to Northern Ireland law, because the Bill is concerned with Northern Ireland. The fact that a charity might be registered with the Charity Commission for England and Wales would not exclude it from Clause 40 provided that it was charitable under Northern Ireland law. We are confident that any charity so registered to which the clause is likely to be relevant would almost certainly be charitable according to the law of Northern Ireland and therefore within the protection of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Member is satisfied with that answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am half-way home, or nearly, because the assurance of the hon. Gentleman that the words
	<br><q><p>"according to the law of Northern Ireland"</p></q>
have no practical effect, at any rate relieves my immediate anxieties. It may leave some residual worry about why the words are there at all. I do not think the fact that this is a Northern Ireland Act is in itself a sufficient ground for their being there. There must be some mysterious reason—a draftsman's reason—why they are nevertheless, thought to be necessary. Since that particular brand of parliamentary lawyer is not paid by so much a line, there must be a reason somewhere for it. I am therefore prepared to accept the practical assurance of the Under-Secretary on the practical point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But on my first difficulty I have to confess to some embarrassment because the fault is clearly mine that I have not yet arrived home. Is the Under-Secretary saying that this is to be construed as if there were, so to speak, a comma after the word "provision" in line 13 and after the word
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>469</span>
"instrument" in line 14? In other words, does it construe as a provision made for purposes which are exclusively charitable, being a provision contained in an enactment or instrument? Is that what it means? If so, I have no difficulties at all and there is no restriction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But if it means—and this is the natural interpretation that it is to be a provision not only contained in an enactment or instrument but contained within an enactment or instrument the purposes of which are exclusively charitable, my submission is that those words are restricted. One can have an enactment or instrument, some of the purposes of which are charitable and some of which are not charitable. There must be a good many such enactments or instruments. That would mean that any charitable provisions which happen to be contained in these mixed enactments would not have the benefit of the exception. Perhaps the ferryman—the Charon of this debate—who has taken me half-way across the Styx, will, now that I have given him another hobble, take me the rest of the way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>'safeguarding national security'</p></q>
and insert.
	<br><q><p>'the safety of the United Kingdom or any part of it'.</p></q>
I apologise to the Committee for troubling it again, but this amendment raises a matter of rather greater substance. I should think it has probably given Ministers and their advisers some anxiety. We all, I think, understand what the clause is for, and are in favour of what it is for. But the antennae of all parliamentarians begin to twitch when they learn that things are to be accepted on grounds of "safeguarding national security", and the rest of it. It is the business of Parliament to limit and define that sort of formulae as jealously as we can, without prejudice to the necessary and understood purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I feel that in the context of Northern Ireland the expression "national security" is both excessively vague and excessively wide, and that a more precise formulation, such as we have suggested in the amendment—for which I believe there are statutory precedents—would have the benefit of saying exactly what we are about, which is that where, in the course of employment, the safety of the United Kingdom, which is a comprehensible notion, or the safety of any part of it, is at stake, the Act shall not apply. "National security", it seems to me, like the word "security" itself—which is heavily and tragically overworked in Northern Ireland—is capable of rather indefinite extension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to us that the very vagueness of this expression might make the use of this exception and its interpretation by the courts less secure. I therefore invite the Minister to let us into a little of the thinking of the Government, and to give reasons why a more vague expression is to be preferred to what seems to be perfectly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>471</span>
precise, adequate and clear to everybody, namely:
	<br><q><p>'the safety of the United Kingdom or any part of it'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I say at the outset that "safeguarding national security" is a well-tried form of words, exactly following the wording of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, Section 23, which exempts similar acts from the provisions of Part IV making unlawful discriminatory action by public authorities. It is desirable that the wording of Clause 42 should follow the 1973 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present the clause enables acts done either for the purpose of safeguarding national security or for protecting public safety or public order to be exempted from the Bill. The "safety of the United Kingdom" is already covered by the dual reference in the Bill to national security and public safety or public order. It would be undesirable to remove the express reference to national security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we are saying is that this is a well-tried form of words, following immediately on the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973. All through our proceedings in Committee the right hon. Gentleman has been making sure that we follow words which we have used earlier in the same context. I hope, therefore, that he will accept that this is, as we believe, a widely used phrase and the right phrase to use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has a strong point since we are dealing here with 	<i>eadem materia—</i>the same subject matter—as in the 1973 Act. I was no friend to the 1973 Act and I think that it has fewer friends as time goes by. Although I was not then a representative of Northern Ireland I took some part in the consideration of the Bill as it was going through the House. Perhaps that would have been the time to have looked more sharply at the terminology we were introducing. On balance, we are estopped at this stage by the provision of the 1973 Act. We have reached almost a tit-for-tat stage in the Committee. It would be a happy arrangement if we could continue in that way and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is our duty to be vigilant when the rights or liberties of the subject are affected. In this case I would like to be sure that before a certificate is signed the Minister has genuinely applied his mind to the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again I shall use the same defence as I used on the earlier amendments. Clause 42, in providing for the signing of certificates by or on behalf of the Secretary of State follows the formula in existing legislation such as, for example, the Race Relations Act 1968, the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973, the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. The effect of the amendment would be that certificates under Clause 42 (2) would have to be signed by the Secretary of State personally. It could well happen that the Secretary of State is not available to sign a certificate in relation to a complaint of discrimination made to the agency to which there is an important security dimension. The agency would then be bound to proceed with an investigation and as a result, sensitive and vital security information would be at risk of exposure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I want to raise is one to which the effective defence or explanation put forward in the last two debates does not apply. As I understand the clause, the plea of safeguarding national security or protecting public safety or public order is available, not only upon the certificate of the Secretary of State, but to all who may, or might otherwise be, involved in proceedings arising out of the Bill. It is an exemption which could be claimed by a private citizen in connection with the conduct of his private business or employment. That might be justified but we should not part from so remarkable a provision without some explanation. Although we all have our duties
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0262">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>473</span>
as private citizens in the context of public safety and order and in national security, it is not part of our duties to take steps with a view to safeguarding public safety, public order or national security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entitled to take the view that there are authorities constituted for the purpose and that, provided we obey those authorities and comply with their requirements, we are doing that which is required of us on behalf of public safety or public order. I would not like to see the possibility of an employer being put in the position in which he was able to say "Yes, as a matter of fact, I am discriminating on political or religious grounds among the people that I employ in my factory. But I have formed the view that my factory and its work is so much bound up with national security that I am justified in doing so".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that a private citizen should take that decision. I do not believe that it falls on a private citizen to assess the relevance to public interest of what he is doing—presumably for profit. If he is doing it on contract to the Government or a public authority, we have subsection (2) under which the Secretary of State can make a certificate if it is a matter of public order or public order would be endangered. It is then for the police to advise the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is in general terms to suggest to the Government, as a matter of policy, that where there is a plea of national security, public safety or public order, it should not be made upon the unsupported assertion of a private person. It should only be made upon the authority and upon the voucher of the authorities constituted under the law for looking after those national or public interests. I hope, if I have misunderstood that my misunderstanding will be removed. But if not, I hope that the Minister will consider whether he can justify giving a foothold for any but the constituted public authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be as helpful as I can. It will not be for the employer to be the judge in this case, it will be for the agency and it will want to know why the empolyer failed to obtain a certificate. The chances of the Secretary of State's certificate being obtained on these grounds are slight. We are broadly following existing statutory precedents.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>474</span>
I stress that it is for the agency to be the judge. Obviously it will want to know the reason why a certificate was not obtained in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I shall have to ask the Government to look at this again. Precedent is not binding. The precedents which he cited from the 1973 Act are concerned with discrimination by public authorities. We are dealing here with discrimination primarily by private individuals going about their own lives and conducting their own business. We are not only justified but we are obliged to sever our minds from any consideration of the precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take my argument slowly because the Minister is trying to listen to three people at the same time. He says that the agency, before coming down upon an employer, will take into account the question of safeguarding national security and so on, and wonder why the person concerned has not got a certificate. That does not hold water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of national security and public order might not have occurred to the agency. It might be a matter which is raised by the employer at some later stage. He might not have even mentioned in it in his dealings with the agency when going through the procedures. Yet, at one of those stages he might recourse to the appeals board or courts, and he might be advised by a lawyer that he has a valid ground, based on national security or public order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that point the question of the agency asking why he did not get a certificate does not arise. He would be entitled to retort, even if the question was asked, that the clause did not require him to do it. He might say that the clause was drafted so that he could come to the conclusion on his own responsibility that he did not have to get a certificate and that, therefore, he was going to plead upon his own responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not say that such a man is a silly fellow and that because he has got the right to go for a certificate it will be assumed that he has not got valid grounds if he does not do so. That is not good legislation. It is not good legislation to give the private citizen a choice of action and then to tell him, when he takes one course, that that is no good because, he was given an alternative and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>475</span>
that if there was any substance in his case he should have taken the alternative. The Government would be making a better law if they said that if anyone is to apply at any stage, or if anyone is to appeal under the Act on grounds of national security, they should obtain a certificate from the proper authorities. That is the honest and straightforward way of doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister, at any rate, to make some reservation to enable him to reflect again upon my arguments. He did so before when he responded to some of my arguments. As the hour of One-o'clock approached my arguments appeared to be totally unacceptable. A lapse of 48 hours and the opportunity of reading the cold print and the accurate record of our proceedings led to an entirely different result. My plea is that my words might be read and considered, although I will not carry on until the magic hour of one o'clock for that purpose. I am putting forward the argument in all good faith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that this clause has been looked at very closely indeed all the way through the Bill, and during the drafting of the Bill. I have listened to the right hon. Gentleman and will read his words. When we are talking about acts to safeguard national security this has to be looked at very closely indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

There may be cases where the employer may have a good case on grounds of public safety. The Secretary of State may not wish to be involved. In that case it should be determined by the agency. There are all sorts of possibilities in this clause. We will certainly consider all the reservations which have been put forward. We have looked at this clause in some considerable depth but we will certainly see whether the right hon. Gentleman's words hold any water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>POWERS OF COUNTY COURT AS TO INJUNCTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 157, in page 30, line 6, leave out from '(1)' to end of line 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have found in this Committee, to an extent which I had not previously experienced that smoke signals have come over at almost every part in the proceedings. This is an occasion when I shall be keeping a sharp weather eye open. I must confess I have not succeeded, after several attempts, in discovering what effect these words can have or what they add. May I briefly take the Committee over the clause. The clause refers in subsection (1) to three sections of the Bill where orders are mentioned and says that in the case of those orders, the county court has the same jurisdiction in some respects as the High Court. Subsection (2) applies a section of the county courts Act to the enforcement of an order made by the county court in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon the county court by any of the provisions mentioned in subsection (1). I cannot see why that jurisdiction is conferred in conjunction with this section, because it is only by virtue of this section and subsections (1) and (2) that the jurisdiction is being exercised at all. The clause appears to me to be comprehensive and effective by the time one has got to the words "in subsection (1)". It may be that I misunderstand the position. It may be that I am retching at a gnat, but there is a certain obligation on hon. Members to question the provisions of clauses which they do not understand and I move this amendment by way of making that confession of necscience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a drafting point which the right hon. Gentleman has put forward and, unlike some of the other improvements he has made to the Bill, I am afraid we do not feel that this improves the Bill or makes it any clearer. The clause confers power on a county court to enforce by means of an injunction undertakings or directions given by the agency under Clause 13 to secure a quality of opportunity, orders remedying unlawful discrimination under Clause 31 and orders restraining the publication of unlawful advertisements under Clause 36.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>477</span>
The affect of the amendment would be that it would remove some words from subsection (2). This subsection gives the county court the powers under Section 141 of the County Courts Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 to enforce injunctions granted under the clauses mentioned above in conjunction with this clause by committal. Of course, committal is used only in the last resort. The amendment would, therefore, remove the words
	<br><q><p>"in conjunction with this section".</p></q>
They are technically necessary and I would urge the Committee to accept the outline I have given and say that this clause obviously has to be taken in conjunction with other clauses which we are dealing with at the moment. They tend to hang together. I hope that explanation satisfies the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to help in making progress and I will just content myself by putting the difficulty I feel on the record again so that it can be looked at. It is this, that no order as mentioned in line 5 of page 30 will be made in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by the provisions of subsection (1) unless it is an order being so made by virtue of this clause. This is what subsection (1) has already done. Subsection (1) says "you can make any county court orders of this sort in the context of the three subsections there mentioned". Subsection (2) goes on to say that with such an order which is clearly as a result of subsection (1) there can be enforcement by committal. I cannot see how that process is complete in itself. I have said that not by way of further argument with the right hon. Gentleman, because these things are often sterile in Committee, but so as to put on record words which can be looked at in case there is some drafting point or some point which I have failed to notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if I can help the right hon. Gentleman a little further. We are on deep technical issues at the moment. The words
	<br><q><p>"in conjunction with this section"</p></q>
which the right hon. Gentleman wants to leave out refer to the power to issue an injunction which is conferred by this clause. The injunction is issued in aid of orders under the provisions mentioned in Subsection (1). The jurisdiction is a joint one,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>478</span>
both under these provisions and this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the right hon. Gentleman. I think I am helped. I think the error I committed was to read line 5 of page 30 as if it had been an injunction. I think that was the error into which I fell and I am sorry my failure to understand the clause has cost a few minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>MEANING OF "EMPLOYMENT IN NORTHERN IRELAND" AND "OCCUPATION IN NORTHERN IRELAND"</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no wish to renew, particularly at this stage of the Bill and at this hour, the debate which I had at an earlier stage with the Under-Secretary about the restriction of the ambit of this Bill to employment in Northern Ireland and the concept which is being defined by the present clause. However, the argument which we have put forward and our anxieties are rather reinforced by the expressions in subsection (1) which is, at it were, defining what is employment not in Northern Ireland. Employment not in Northern Ireland is work which is done wholly or mainly outside Northern Ireland. I hope this is a point to which the right hon. Gentleman will not close his mind before the Bill reaches the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put to the right hon. Gentleman the case of recruitment in Northern Ireland by a firm based in Great Britain which has no office in Northern Ireland and nothing which makes it a Northern Ireland firm. It is recruiting in Northern Ireland, yet most of its activities take place all over the world, selling man-made fibre products. Nevertheless, there is a certain link with Northern Ireland in the business, for example, where a man is to be a traveller in the five continents of the world, for this undertaking in Slough but nevertheless there is some content in his work, although
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>479</span>
it will be exceptional, which relates to Northern Ireland and will be done in Northern Ireland. This seems to me to illustrate a rather grotesque distinction between discrimination in Northern Ireland and between Northern Ireland applicants for jobs according to whether the employer is based in Northern Ireland or based in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he is based in Northern Ireland, even though all the work will be done in Africa, the provisions of the Bill apply. But if he is based in Slough I do not know why I have Slough on my mind this morning—I have never agreed with that scurrillous verse about:
	<br><q><p>"Slough that is not fit for humans now".</p></q>
If the firm is in Slough, and the employees after recruitment will work all over the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>480</span>
world, including Northern Ireland, that firm can discriminate as much as it likes. For all I know the management of that firm may be a Northern Ireland management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I simply do not believe it is satisfactory to draw this distinction at present being attempted between employment in Northern Ireland and the employment outside Northern Ireland. We find chapter and verse in the terminology of this Clause. I can just resume my seat in time for the Minister to be able to answer next time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
