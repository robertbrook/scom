	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Stanley Orme)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I finished my remarks at our last sitting with the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"There seems no good reason for this amendment".</p></blockquote>
—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee H,</i> 25th March 1976, c.386]. However, to prove how flexible are the Government, I can now say that, on reflection, the unanswerable case put by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) is reason enough for the Government to accept the amendment, and I ask the Committee to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his candour as, I am sure is the Committee, particularly in quoting his concluding words at the last sitting, which has relieved me of the necessity of doing so myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that this acceptance means that the right hon. Gentleman is continuing to apply his mind without prejudice to the matters which are brought forward, as also are the matters brought forward from this side of the Committee brought forward in good faith and with a genuine desire to improve the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one observation and, perhaps, a lesson we might draw, from this happy little event, and that is that sometimes the public—indeed, we ourselves—are inclined to think that our Committee deliberations may proceed at too stately a pace, whereas, on the contrary, it is this regular tempo which enables proper consideration of a Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
When I reflected on the truncated debate at the end of Thursday's proceedings, I felt that I had been much to blame for the unclarity and excessive brevity with which I had moved the amendment. It turns out, however, that the hieroglyphs have proved to be decipherable, with this fortunate result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 112, in line 22, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'other than this Act, until any such appeal is determined or abandoned'.</p></blockquote>
I move this amendment flushed with a new hope, confidence and optimism as a result of the manner in which the Committee has begun its deliberations today. Indeed, there is—if I can convey it—a really substantial point behind the amendment, even if its terms have not hit off the meaning of my hon. Friends and myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many matters on which an appeal unrelated to the provisions of this measure could be brought, for example, by a person who wished to be registered as a member of a professional association. That association might, in his view, have unjustly or improperly refused his application, and he might be pursuing his right under other enactments to appeal against that decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I read subsection (5), that would prevent the agency from considering a complaint by that person, that not only had his actual qualifications as an accountant and the fact that the "University of Sydney" which had given them to him was included in a list of such bodies for purposes of enrolment been ignored, but, quite separately from that, that he had been the subject of discrimination as defined by this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obviously right that there should not be concurrent rights of appeal under two different enactments, and that an order should be established wherein, if there are such alternative rights of appeal, they should be taken. We feel that subsection (5) would unduly limit the functions of the agency where an appeal has been brought in respect of an act—and it is the same act—but on different grounds under a different enactment. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman undertakes to give attention to that point if he cannot remove the anxieties which we feel at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0218">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman made the case for the clause and subsection (5), as it stands, when he said that, in a sense, it would be inappropriate to allow complaint to be laid before more than one body at a time. Where existing legislation already provides some other means of seeking redress, this should continue to be used rather than the agency. If I may, I shall give the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) one or two examples which underline this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, in the case of removal from the register or roll of nurses, or roll of midwives, appeal is to the High Court under the Nurses and Midwives Act (Northern Ireland) 1970, Section 45. In the case of the grant of a licence to carry on a nursing agency, appeal is to a court of summary jurisdiction under the Nursing Homes and Nursing Agencies Act (Northern Ireland) 1971, Section 12. In the case of the grant of a licence to keep a pet shop, and so on, appeal is to a court of summary jurisdiction under the Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 1972, Section 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are three examples, and I could give the right hon. Gentleman others. It would be wrong for one to say that the agency could come in at, say, county court level whereas the case should be, is being or has been dealt with at High Court level under previous legislation. I can only tell the right hon. Gentleman that one could have, if there were no restraint on it, the agency duplicating or complicating issues which should rightly be dealt with by other means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am, of course, in agreement with the righ hon. Gentleman's proposition and intention, but I wonder whether I have sufficiently made clear the difficulty which my hon. Friends and I feel and which may be covered somehow by the wording of the remainder of the clause, or elsewhere in the Bill. It is not, however, clear how it is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take one of the cases that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned. By the way, we were interested to hear that an appeal against a refusal of a licence to keep a pet shop might be one of the grounds of appeal which ousted, according to this clause, the activities of the agency. I do not know whether we have misread the measure, but we did not realise that discrimination in the issue of licences to
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
keep a pet shop might fall within the ambit of the Bill. However, be that as it may, that was not only 	<i>obiter dictum—</i> said by the way—but also 	<i>per incuriam</i>—as a result of oversight—by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the case of a nurse. A nurse has been struck off the nursing register on the grounds that she has shown, in some way or other, either incompetence or impropriety in the execution of her professional duties. It is perfectly clear that she can appeal against this. I ask the Committee whether it is right that because she can appeal against removal or failure to be added to the register of nurses on grounds of professional incompetence or impropriety, the function of the agency should be ousted in considering any complaint which she may wish to make in accordance with the rest of the Bill—that in addition or alternatively there has been actual discrimination against her on the grounds as defined by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot think that it would be right, if we have constituted the agency so that it is appropriate for considering cases of alleged discrimination, that its function should simply be ousted if there is any other ground of appeal on matters not connected with discrimination against the particular act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman will, I am sure, agree that in many cases where appeals on other grounds could lie it is unfortunately the case that in Northern Ireland people thus disadvantaged would be more inclined to suppose that some sort of discrimination was at work. Therefore, the provision of a safety valve, if that was how they felt they could claim their rights under the Bill, should not be eliminated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I have given the right honourable Gentleman a further insight, whether mistaken or not, into the intentions behind the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I quoted the example of pet shops it was not a frivolous quotation. Keeping a pet shop is an occupation and it is covered by Clause 23 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crux of the right honourable Gentleman's argument is that normally—and this includes all the examples that I have given—discrimination could be one of the matters of which the appeal body would be able to take account. Therefore, there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>391</span>
would be no need to go to the agency after exhausting the complaint. In the case which the right honourable Gentleman put to the Committee, there is normally no statutory appeal against the decisions of professional organisations. Therefore, the subsection would not apply. To give a further example: a midwife can appeal to the courts. Most of these appeals are to the courts and it would be wrong for the agency to investigate a court of law as such. We are trying to keep distinct the operation of the courts, and not involve the agency where the courts are rightly applying themselves to the cases that I have quoted. Both the right honourable Gentleman and I can think of recent legislation which confused the operation of the courts and attempted to bring it into disrepute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this answer meets the right hon. Gentleman's points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for pursuing the matter with such care. However, before I beg leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment I would not say, since the right hon. Gentleman's second thoughts have already proved so much wiser than his first, that I am proposing to appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober, nor from Philip sober to Philip drunk. The right hon. Gentleman's sobriety is as total on a Thursday as on a Tuesday and I am sure that his mental functions are as acute. But we all have the experience that the second time round can result in a more fortunate outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I come to the main point with which I wish to leave the right hon. Gentleman may I refer—and in no spirit of frivolity— to the pet shop. It must have come as a surprise to those hon. Members of the Committee who are attending closely to this debate that a licence to maintain a pet shop is under Clause 23 a qualification needed for, or facilitating, one's engagement in the occupation of pet shop keeping. I imagine, as with all other professions, well or ill conducted there must be a Grand National Federation of Pet Shop Keepers, and I am sure that they have a qualification, the result of successfully completing a three year course in pet shop keeping, which is prominently displayed and has a great advantage in the shop window of the pet shop keeper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If qualifications in Clause 23 mean a
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
licence issued under a statute, I think this is something which we ought firmly and clearly to note. I see that the right hon. Gentleman is drawing something from the the arsons of the other parts of the Bill and so, no doubt, on that, Mrs. Jeger, we shall presently be satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the main point on which I wanted to appeal to the right hon. Gentleman, though not in the statutory sense. He said, and again I agree, that it is wrong that where a person has recourse to a court, we should invoke the agency as well. We are considering, by way of example, the case where a person's removal from a list or register is appealed against, either through statutory machinery or by way of a court, on the grounds on which that act was done namely, that the nurse had shown persistent negligence and had been the subject of disciplinary action in the hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me inappropriate that the same tribunal should also address its mind to the quite separate matter of a possible offence having been committed under this Bill, for clearly, the appeals tribunals, where there are such, will be tribunals constituted for looking at qualifications. They will be looking at the qualifications of a nurse, whether or not her particular misdemeanour was really serious enough to justify her removal. But under this Bill we are constituting an agency and setting up a procedure attached to its activities deliberately beamed at the identification and tactful handling of religious and political discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will consider, on the basis of the many cases which his advisers will be able to put before him, whether this complete ousting—as I do not think that subsection (6) helps us—of the action of the agency is desirable. If the right hon. Gentleman indicates that he will do that, I shall be glad to ask the leave of the Committee to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Coming back to the point about the pet shop, I can confirm to the right hon. Gentleman that the interpretation under Clause 23 is quite correct. It is an occupation, and it would fall within the normal purview of the Bill, if the Bill applied. One would obviously have to take into account the provisions of the Bill, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>393</span>
number of people employed, and so on, within its broad scope. But I confirm that, whilst it was a random example given to the Committee, it was germane to the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This means that the term "qualification"—though the definition in page 41, line 1, does not refer, of course, to anything of this sort—includes statutory licence. It was the licensing rather than the qualifications which excited one's curiosity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite correct. I confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the central point raised by the right hon. Gentleman, I am advised that the appeals body can consider an appeal of the midwife, pet shop keeper, etc., who could raise alleged discrimination on one of the grounds—say, for instance, the dismissal of the midwife or of the nurse whom the right hon. Gentleman is citing. I am not saying that this is an ideal situation but, quite frankly, one cannot have two bodies discussing both issues, as it were. If it was before a court of law as such, perhaps for another reason, and this matter was raised at that time, it would then be in order for the court to look at both examples of the alleged discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I am prepared to consider what the right hon. Gentleman has said, I think there is justification for leaving the clause as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what the right hon. Gentleman has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question, proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A debate on the Question "That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill" might provide the Minister of State with an opportunity of placing on record for our enlightenment the relationship, if any, of the appeals machinery and, indeed, the agency itself to complaints to the Parliamentary Commissioner or the Commissioner for Complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that under Clause 58, the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner and the Commissioner for Complaints would not extend to proceedings provided for in the Bill or for
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
actions of the Fair Employment Agency. If that is so, is the Minister of State satisfied that there would be sufficient redress? I know that there is an appeals board. Is he satisfied that maladministration by the agency would be sufficiently dealt with? I know that the agency will be appointed by the whole of the Department of Manpower Services for Northern Ireland and, therefore, ultimately the subject of some form of parliamentary control. If there were to be maladministration by the agency—I am not referring to complaints of unlawful discrimination—is he satisfied that there is sufficient provision to deal with such maladministration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is "Yes". When the agency is appointed by the Minister it will operate in its own right but will be under firm parliamentary control. Any complaint of maladministration against the agency could quickly be brought to the attention of Parliament and the Government. It would then be the duty of the Minister or the Government to take action. One does not envisage that possibility, but I accept that in extreme circumstances it could happen. I think the safeguards are adequate to meet those circumstances, along parliamentary and governmental lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister of State. Would there be any harm—indeed, there may be some good—in allowing complaints to the Parliamentary Commissioner or the Commissioner of Complaints to lie against maladministration of the agency itself, while reserving to the agency actual complaints of unlawful discrimination under this legislation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly look at that suggestion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to that exchange, it is difficult to relate Clause 58 to Clause 24, but is it clear that, as has just been said, it would be the agency and not the Commissioner for Complaints who would take precedence in a matter of alleged discrimination? If one reads those two clauses together, the entertaining of a complaint by the Commissioner would oust the functions of the agency in accordance with the debate which has just taken place. If not, could it be explained
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0221">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
why investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner is not caught by either subsections (5) or (6) of Clause 24?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly it is not as the right hon. Gentleman has explained to the Committee. Perhaps we can look at this in more detail when we come to Clause 58 and, if the right hon. Gentleman will accept that, I will certainly look at it. My advice at present is that it is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a point on this clause which I raise in a general manner and without any intention of arguing textually an amendment which in your wisdom, Mrs. Jeger, you have not called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The anxiety relates to subsection (1) which describes what the agency does after it has investigated a complaint. First, it shall,
	<br><blockquote><p>"form an opinion…"</p></blockquote>
and secondly, it shall,
	<br><blockquote><p>"use its best endeavours…"</p></blockquote>
It can use its best endeavours to secure a satisfactory written undertaking by the respondent to comply with the terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the right hon. Gentleman could explain what processes are, as it were, triggered by the agency's opinion of the satisfactory nature of the written undertaking, for a written undertaking to comply with the terms of the settlement appears to be as it says—a written undertaking to comply with the terms of the settlement. A qualification to such an undertaking is surely not desirable. If the terms of the undertaking were unsatisfactory, then it could not be an undertaking to comply with the terms. There is the settlement, those are the terms of it, and there is a written undertaking to comply with it. I wonder whether an additional prong to the agency's fork is being introduced with no real advantage to these processes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The argument and the point that the right hon. Gentleman has made about the removal of the word "satisfactory" is that it is unnecessary because if a written undertaking is given to the effect that the terms of the settlement will be complied with, that is of itself satisfactory. It is not necessarily so. The agency may, on occasion, find it necessary not only to prescribe the terms of the settlement but also its form or the action to be taken to achieve the result prescribed. It is important to bear in mind that under Clause 30, the agency may institute an action in the county court where the terms of an undertaking have not been complied with, and, for this procedure to work satisfactorily, the agency must be the judge of whether the undertaking is appropriate and satisfactory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a reply which discloses more than was evident in the terms of the word "satisfactory". It may be desirable for the working of the measure if what lies behind it, which appears on first hearing to be entirely reasonable, could be more precisely expressed in the terminology of the clause. Perhaps both the right hon. Gentleman with his superior resources and some of us might put our thinking caps on about that between now and the next stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>APPEAL TO COUNTY COURT AGAINST AGENCY'S FINDING ON COMPLAINT OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 119, in line 28, leave out from 'under' to end of line 30 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'this section, the parties shall be the Agency and the appellant'.</p></blockquote>
Clause 28 deals with the right of appeal of an employer and an employee to the county court against the findings of the agency. The agency has, in effect, investigated a complaint, arrived at certain conclusions and served notice on the employer and the employee as to its findings. Obviously its findings can be that unlawful discrimination has or has not taken place. The clause then specifies that if the findings are that unlawful discrimination has taken place the employer may appeal, and that if discrimination has not taken place the employee may appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our objection is that in subsection (5) the parties to the appeal where the agency has found that discrimination has taken
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
place are the agency and the employer, but that where the agency has found that discrimination has not occurred the parties are the employer and the employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our contention is that it is the findings of the agency which are being appealed against and, therefore, that the agency should be a party to the appeal. That is why our amendment states that in any appeal under this clause the parties shall be the agency and the person or parties appealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This could also be regarded as a probing amendment in as much as we do not understand why there should be this difference between the two categories.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the terms in which the hon. Gentleman has moved the amendment. To some extent this raises a technical point, and his question was a valid one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to make the agency and the appellant—who may be either the respondent or the complainant—the parties to all appeals against a finding of the agency. It does not change the provision in the Bill relating to appeals following a finding by the agency that there has been unlawful discrimination. In that case the respondent may appeal, and the parties to the appeal will be the respondent and the agency. This is consistent with the general policy of the Bill that the agency will take action on behalf of a complainant to remedy his grievance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker), the amendment would change the provision under which on an appeal against a finding by the agency that there has been no unlawful discrimination, the parties to the appeal will be the complainant and the respondent. Acceptance of the amendment would have the effect of making the parties the complainant and the agency and would be unjust to the respondent since he would not be permitted to make his own case on the appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that has met the point made by the hon. Gentleman. I accept that it is a difficult legal point, but I hope that I have dealt with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) is satisfied. I am not yet satisfied, although I do not despair of eliciting an explanation which will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
satisfactory both to the acute and critical mind of my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh and of all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman described exactly and precisely the effect of the amendment, which is to make the agency which comes to the conclusion, be it affirmative or negative, the party to the subsequent appeal, whichever way that appeal goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What puzzled me was why the right hon. Gentleman said that it was unfair to the respondent, if the finding was negative, to have to make his case against the agency—I think he may have meant the complainant—whereas it was not unfair to the respondent to have to make his case against the agency where the appeal was against a positive fight. I do not see the difference between the two cases, except that in the one case it is the employer and in the other it is the employee who is involved. That is not the reason that the right hon. Gentleman had in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I perhaps help the right hon. Gentleman on this point? The effect of the Bill as drafted is that the employer can make his appeal to the agency, and the right hon. Gentleman and his Friends should welcome this. The effect of the amendment is to remove that right from the employer as such.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman has got it right. If the amendment is made, the subsection will read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In an appeal under this section,…"—</p></blockquote>
that is, any of the appeals against an affirmative and a negative determination—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the parties shall be the Agency and the appellant".</p></blockquote>
Therefore the effect of the amendment is to put the party against whose wishes the determination has taken place into one seat, and the agency into the other. My hon. Friends and I are motivated, not only by the apparent absence of equity between the two provisions, but also by the fact that we feel that it is fairer for the complainant to have the opportunity of making his case against the agency than to have to make his case in open court against the employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are here establishing the agency as the court of first instance on discrimination.
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
We are saying "If you do not like its determination, you can appeal to the county court." Why should the appeal be against the agency if it finds affirmatively, but not against the agency if it finds negatively? It is that which we find difficult to understand. We cannot see where the injustice would arise under the amendment. On the contrary, we are much more inclined to fear that there could be inconvenience to the employee and that he would find himself more disadvantageously placed if his case was against the respondent
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I instance what is in my mind. The right hon. Gentleman is aware that there are certain circumstances in which a wealthy person or a firm can deliberately ensure that the costs involved in an action are higher than, shall I say, they would otherwise be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not for a moment believe that if the agency is a party to these cases it will act oppressively in that way. But we would much rather that it were the agency, whenever an appeal takes place, for we are sure that in that respect the agency will act fairly. We do not like the idea of the disgruntled complainant having to take the matter through the county court with, as it were, a new adversary in the person of the respondent, with all the opportunities available to his adversary to say, "This employee of mine has gone in front of the agency. If he appeals to the county court, by Jove I will take him over ditch and through hedge." That is what we fear may happen if the wording of the clause remains in its present unbalanced form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McClusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the right hon. Gentleman intended me to understand what he was saying. But I did not. I used terms like "employer" and "employee"—although there are other categories covered by these words—because I can understand what they mean. However, I am still in the predicament where one has an aggrieved party—whether it be an employer of an employee—who is aggrieved at the findings of the agency. Why in one instance can the aggrieved party take the agency to court and appeal against its findings, and in the other instance one cannot? If the Minister will give me his explanation again, using terms like "employer" and "employee", perhaps I shall be able to understand his meaning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I come first to the case that the right hon. Member for Down,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
South (Mr. Powell) put to the Committee. What he is saying is that if the complainant is the appellant, the employer—the respondent—will not be a party and will not be able to present his case. It gives the employer a chance to present his case on appeal. The amendment would damage that chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I clarify the point raised by the hon. Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker). If the complainant is appealing, the agency will conduct his appeal for him. He may not be capable of conducting his case himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the right hon. Gentleman say where that is in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that. The Bill reflects the realities that complainants will not be capable of conducting their own appeal, but employers will have the right and the opportunity of publicly putting their case. We are somewhat at cross purposes on an interpretation of the clause, which in essence is trying to assist the employer in this particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Armagh made the point that the amendment is in a sense a probing amendment. But the amendment will damage the right of the employer in certain instances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the agency has investigated a case and has come to a conclusion, that it has then served notice on an employee that his complaint is not justified, that there has not been discrimination, that the employee then decides to appeal against that decision, and the agency which has told him that the investigation has proved no discrimination now fights the case for the employee in court against the employer? That is my interpretation of what the Minister said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I was not saying that. I said that the terms of this amendment could damage the right of the employer in putting his case on appeal. I thought I had explained that clearly a little while ago, in my example of the complainant appealing and the agency being able to conduct an appeal for him, as he, the complainant, may not be capable of doing
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
it for himself. Therefore, the Bill reflects the realities of the situation but, on the same grounds, one does not want to exclude the employer from the right of appeal, which is what the amendment would do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But surely the right hon. Gentleman takes the validity of my hon. Friend's point, that it is quite unreasonable for the agency having found no discrimination and having, therefore, in its view, discovered that there are no grounds for an appeal. Others may find grounds, but the agency has not found any; otherwise it would have found that there was discrimination. The agency then says, "Have another go with our support. We will conduct the case for you, although we do not believe it. Although it is an appeal against us, we will conduct the case for you." I do not believe that the right hon. Gentleman can regard that as realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now come to the case made by the right hon. Gentleman, that the object of this provision is fairness to the employer—let us substitute the term "employer"—who will be able to present his own case instead of the agency taking it on for him. Surely if we envisage this in real terms, the agency in defending its finding is going to call the employer in evidence; it is essentially acting in this case on the employer's side and will deploy the employer's case, and its lawyer, presumably, will work hand in glove with the solicitor of the respondent. I must say that we see no ground to apprehend that when the agency is defending its own decisions it will be careless of the evidence upon which they were based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that the debate has necessarily been in the nature of a cross-talk, but the debate on this subsection has shown that there are practical difficulties behind it, and has disclosed grounds of disquiet which hon. Members must feel at the notion of the agency conducting an appeal against its own decisions. This is certainly a reversal of the nursery rhyme, "I'll be judge, I'll be jury". This is being judge in one's own cause, and being suitor against oneself. That is what, in effect, we are making the agency, by putting in "complainant" here and then going on to say, as the right hon. Gentleman rightly said, that in the case of complaint, that complaint will be taken up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
by the very agency against which the appeal is being conducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman to accept that sufficient difficulty has been exposed by this short debate, which we are not endeavouring to prolong unduly, to justify his thinking this through from the start in practical terms. May I say to him, from some little experience, that I understand how difficult it is, having once envisaged a clause in one form, to revise that judgment, if one is going to do so, in consultation which takes place during the debate on an amendment before the Committee. I am asking the right hon. Gentleman to say that the anxieties of my hon. Friend and myself have sufficient 	<i>prima facie</i> grounds for him to be justified in saying that he will think the whole matter through again, and that we shall have an opportunity of hearing his more mature conclusions at the next stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may try to clarify the point. I may have inadvertently misled the Committee about the terms of the agency fighting the case as such, so I shall try to clarify the matter. If an employee appeals, he fights his own case against the employer. I think we are all clear on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Against the agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the employer appeals, he fights his case against the agency because the complainant is not really suited to fighting the case. That is the distinction I wish to draw which I think clarifies the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My difficulty is that, if the complainant is not capable of fighting the case against the employer when the agency has found in his favour, he is 	<i>a fortiori</i> not capable of fighting the case against the employer when the agency has found against him. The very ground which the right hon. Gentleman has given makes the claimant's position still more anomalous than the preceding course of the debate. I appeal to the right hon. Gentleman, who throughout has been most helpful, to look at this again. He will have realised from the discussion that there is no intention to be oppressive to the complainant but, on the contrary, we believe that our amendment will prove
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
less oppressive to the complainant in practice, and a rethink of this will be helpful to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, without prejudice, I undertake to examine the arguments that have been put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We fully appreciate that an employee might have difficulty in fighting an appeal and that there might not be sympathy for him in the court. One could argue that the agency during its initial investigations would be showing every sympathy towards that person, and one would hope that at that level the agency's findings would be such that the right of appeal would not really have much meaning. However, in the light of the Minister's assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a technical point to raise on which I think it would be fair to seek clarification. In what circumstances would the court's decree that unlawful discrimination was committed not be evidence of such a fact, apart from this subsection? I am sure that the parliamentary draftsmen would not have given themselves the luxury of subsection (3) unless there were circumstances to which it was directed, but, not being of the legal profession, I am at a loss, as are perhaps other hon. Members, to know in what circumstances a court's decree upon an appeal to the effect that unlawful discrimination was committed would not be evidence even without this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to satisfy himself on that and will be able to supply the Committee with some guidance, for I am sure that you, Mrs. Jeger, and he would agree that it is quite wrong in Committee to add a clause to the Bill the practical effect of which it has not fully understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention, again without arguing minutiae, to what at first sight appears to be an excessive degree of latitude given to the agency. When I raised a similar point on Clause 25 regarding the word "satisfactory", the right hon. Gentleman rightly set my mind at rest. He may well be able to do so again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I become worried when I find in the Bill the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"within such period as the Agency considers reasonable".</p></blockquote>
The reasonableness or unreasonableness of the period might be a ground on which a court would conclude one way or another. After all, the agency has an inherent duty to behave reasonably. I will not go back to the jungle of the problem of quotas, but the agency, under a settlement, may require a number of steps to be taken by the employer which, in the nature of things, will require time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in a recession, I can visualise circumstances in which it may be difficult for the employer to rectify even acknowledged discrimination in a short period. Should the agency then come upon the employer, under this clause it should be possible for the employer, in resisting it, to say that it was quite unreasonable for the agency, only a month after its finding, given the terms of the settlement, to expect that employer to have complied with the terms. On the contrary, this wording places the judgment of what is reasonable with the agency, not the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause had said "within a reasonable period", it would clearly be open to the court to say "That was unreasonable. The agency acted unreasonably. We will
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
not, therefore, proceed to enforcement." But the terms of the clause, as it stands, are a positive direction, as I understand it, to the court to say "If the agency thinks it reasonable for the employer to have done this in three weeks, so be it. We cannot inquire into the matter."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am inclined to think that cannot be the intention. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will consider whether the reasonableness should be more clearly justiciable than it appears on the face of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman, in effect, is cleverly discussing on stand part an amendment which has not been selected. I raise no objection to that. Of course, if one cannot get in through the front door, there is always the back door on stand part, as we all know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of removing these words would be to remove from the agency, the power to decide when to go to the court and thus enable the respondent to challenge the legality of bringing proceedings on the ground that the agency had not allowed a long enough time to elapse. Before reaching the situation with which Clause 30 deals, both parties to a complaint of unlawful discrimination will have had ample opportunity to put their case, and the agency will have endeavoured to settle the matter by conciliation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's view is that, taking into account safeguards already provided in the Bill, the decision when to institute an action in the court must be the agency's alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It goes without saying that the decision when to institute an action must be the agency's. But the question is whether the court should have the right to apply its mind to the period that the employer has had for rectification of the complaint. I doubt whether I have used the right technical words, but the right hon. Gentleman will know what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the court is to be sovereign in deciding whether the agency is to have its way, the matter of timing ought to be within the purview of the court as well as the matter of the content of the settlement or recommendations. Clearly time as well as content are of the essence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
There may be a legitimate difference of opinion, which there should be an opportunity for the court to decide, whether a period of three months was adequate for the achievement of the required settlement. I do not understand why the right hon. Gentleman wants to take that matter away from the consideration of the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a big point. I am sure that it is the right hon. Gentleman's intention, and that of the Government, that, where the Bill provides recourse to the court from the agency, there should be no suspicion or ground for thinking that the dice have been loaded against the citizen before he gets to the court. We should lean the other way. So sure are we of the reasonableness of the agency—a lot has been said about it in the course of the Committee's proceedings—that we ought not at this stage to be seen to be precluding a court from adjudicating upon any aspect of a matter on which the agency comes to it asking for enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still on Part III, the sharp end of the Bill, and it is rightly the ordinary process of law in the ordinary courts of the land which in the last resort enforces the provisions of the Bill. That being so, the more the right hon. Gentleman leaves at large for the discretion of the courts, the more the operation of the Bill will be surrounded by good will. Although we are discussing the general motion "That the Clause stands part of the Bill", I suggest that there is room for the right hon. Gentleman to reconsider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have taken careful note of what the right hon. Gentleman said, but his proposal is undesirable. Every respondent could challenge the proceedings on the ground that the time allowed by the agency was unreasonable. That is not really a matter for the court as such. I do not think that the terms of the clause are in any way restrictive, as the right hon. Gentleman suggests. Therefore, I hope the Committee will accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 125, in page 22, line 34, after 'law'
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(iii) in assessing compensation under paragraph (b) the court shall offset against the loss of value of other opportunity of which the injured person has availed himself consequent upon that loss.'</p></blockquote>
This amendment raises a very important, but difficult matter—namely, how, after the event, when discrimination is found to have taken place, the loss incurred thereby by the victim, is to be quantified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two broad alternatives. First, we may say "We must look entirely at the event. He was refused that job on discriminatory grounds, as has been found. Now we must consider, with the blinkers on, the degree of his loss through not getting that job. We must consider it in abstraction, as though this were the second after he had failed to get the appointment."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative is to say "Here we are, three, six, nine months after the event. There is no doubt that there was discrimination. There is no doubt that, but for discrimination, he would have had that job. But it so happens that, three months later, he found a better job." The fact that he found a better job does not mean that there was no discrimination and does not alter the fact of discrimination. It does not make it less discriminatory that someone else did not discriminate against him. Nevertheless, that man today, at the moment of adjudication, is better off than in all foreseeable likelihood he would have been, but for the act of discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are facing a real difficulty, which it would have been wrong not to have raised and specifically discussed. On the one hand, we are in danger of saying that, provided we can avert the practical consequences of an act of discrimination, we shall have no remedy against it. That is what we say if we take the one horn of the dilemma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, we embrace the other uncomfortable object, we are saying to a man "You shall be paid for the job you did not get in addition to receiving the emoluments of the better job still, for which you would not have been available had you not been discriminated against."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman asks what view my hon. Friends and myself take—which horn are we going to embrace—my answer is that we are dealing here with the action of the court and that this is 	<i>par excellence,</i> the kind of situation where the court can be wise in individual cases when
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>409</span>
the legislature is incapable of adequately defining the whole range of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, and if certain cabalistic signs are conveyed to me that so far I may have carried the right hon. Gentleman with me, then I want to be sure that the drafting of the clause leaves it open to the court, in its discretion, to take into account all circumstances, including the subsequent career, opportunities, or circumstances of the complainant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is far from clear to us that is so under the clause as it now stands. In page 22, lines 14 and 15, the compensation is related to the loss suffered
	<br><blockquote><p>"in consequence of the act of unlawful discrimination".</p></blockquote>
The natural meaning of those words would be to restrict the purview of the court, in assessing the compensation, to the direct consequences of that act. It might be said that it was not a consequence of that act that there was a better job round the corner or that the complainant had just the qualifications for that better job round the corner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, if the right hon. Gentleman can say that he is advised that the interpretation of
	<br><blockquote><p>"loss…suffered in consequence of the act"</p></blockquote>
can take into account, to use the words of the amendment,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the value of other opportunity of which the injured person has availed himself consequent upon that loss",</p></blockquote>
then our anxieties will be much relieved. However, I am sure that the Committee would consider it right that the right hon. Gentleman should enter upon this thorny question of the nature and the assessment of the loss incurred. It is in the hope that he will do so that I am moving the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman moves his amendment and then gives the reasons why the amendment is unnecessary. I can confirm the latter part of his statement. The key word, of course, is "loss". Compensation can only be awarded for loss. If the complainant has reduced that loss by availing himself of an opportunity of taking another job, that will automatically be taken into account by the court under Clause 31(1) (	<i>b</i>). Conversely, if the complainant has not availed himself of another opportunity of which he ought
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
reasonably to have availed himself, he will have failed to mitigate his loss, and sub-paragraph (i) of Clause 31(1) will have the effect of requiring the court to reduce the compensation accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the worse fears that the right hon. Gentleman has about this clause are, I think, met by these two provisions. The analysis that he gave to the Committee met the point fairly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) wish to ask leave to withdraw the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. It is useful to have the interpretation of the clause on the record. Obviously, it is a matter of great importance, and I am not sure that it has been fully understood. It is right that it should go out from this Committee that a loss for which a person will be compensated arising out of a discriminatory act is a net loss, and may be nil even where undoubted discrimination and loss of employment opportunity has taken place. It will certainly help to ease the administration of the measure if it is understood that that is the principle which lies, if not at the end of the road, a good way down the road. This will go far to reduce the number of complaints for the sake of complaints, and complaints for the sake of antagonism, which would otherwise have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt), who is a keen supporter of this legislation, had appreciated the position as it stands under this clause. I do not know whether he had appreciated that in the event of a person being discriminated against and losing a good job, a better job which he gets three months later which he would otherwise have missed had it not have been for the fortunate discrimination will be offset against the amount of his loss. Certainly this ought to be embodied in whatever publicity comes in due course to be given to the working of this legislation and the popular interpretation of its provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has raised a question: has there been a loss of equal opportunity? That depends on whether or not another opportunity of equality is available to the person concerned

	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
I endorse what the right hon. Gentleman has said about this. We do not want frivolous complaints. I think this amendment will go some way towards stopping that, and I hope that this has been clarified by the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish briefly to address the Committee on this clause because it may be valuable—and part of the value which arises from this Committee stage is the candid clarification which the right hon. Gentleman gives—if this matter of advertisement is clarified in its practical application in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary will recall that in earlier stages the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt), I think, referred to the significance of an advertisement appearing in one journal and not in another. I believe that reference was made to a journal with which a Northern Ireland Member of this House is connected. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] There is such a journal, to the best of my knowledge, and I thought that reference had been made to it, if not in this debate. Incidentally, I was not referring to the hon. Member for Belfast, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of the clause is not clear to some of us, at any rate, and it evidently was not clear to the official Opposition. In your wisdom, however, Mrs. Jeger, you have not selected their amendment and, therefore, I cannot refer to it. It is not disorderly, however, to have known what were the intentions of Her Majesty's official Opposition. It is by no means clear that the expression
	<br><blockquote><p>"could reasonably be understood as indicating an intention"</p></blockquote>
in line 20, would not attach to the appearance of an advertisement solely in a notori-
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
ously Protestant or, if one likes, a notoriously Roman Catholic journal. In other words, will this offence involve selection of places and manner of advertisement? Clearly it relates to the content of an advertisement. One understands that well, but does it also relate to the choice of advertising media? Perhaps that question is not so simple as might be supposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain types of advertisement appear in certain types of journal. Without specifying, certain "glossies" which may occur to hon. Members are appropriate for certain types of advertisements. Certain types of advertiser tend to use those journals exclusively for making contact with potential consumers or, shall I say, customers. At any rate, it is for such purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It my be that, apart from that sort of appropriateness, there is a clear affiliation—political or even religious—on the part of such journals. Before we add this clause to the Bill, we should hear the view of the Minister, and how wide, in his view, is the ambit of unlawful advertising, as defined. In other words, will it be possible to come upon a person for breach of the law under Part IV because he has advertised in one journal and not in another?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerard Fitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself in potential agreement with the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) when he seeks clarification on this point. On the last occasion we met in the Committee, reference was made to the three local newspapers in Belfast—the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph,</i> the 	<i>Irish News</i> and the 	<i>Belfast Newsletter—</i>two of them, one accepts, supporting policies of the UUUC. I would not go all the way with the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph,</i> which, I believe, tries to hold an impartial position in the ring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 33 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be unlawful to publish in Northern Ireland".</p></blockquote>
This covers a lot of territory in Northern Ireland. We are not only talking about the recognised Press which is published throughout Northern Ireland. There are a lot of fringe publications. Indeed, reference has been made in this House on a number of occasions to the type of editorial comment and advertisements which have been carried in a very notable publication throughout Northern Ireland, and in the 	<i>Protestant Telegraph,</i> which has close
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
connections with the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) who, I understand, is the editor of that particular newspaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) that it is unreasonable to expect a publication such as the 	<i>Protestant Telegraph</i> in any way to begin to change its editorial comments or the type of advertisement material which it carries. But we have in the past had reason to bring this particular publication before the attention of the House because of some of the articles which were carried—articles which were openly and clearly sectarian, and which have made malicious attacks on the minority—in fact, it is the majority if one wants to include the Roman Catholic religion—in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause as it stands becomes law, will it relate to publications such as the 	<i>Protestant Telegraph?</i> Will it be made clear to that newspaper, which has a substantial readership—although I am not sure whether it is recognised by the journalistic profession—among certain groups of people and certain areas of Northern Ireland. I am asking my right hon. Friend to clarify whether publications such as this are subject to the same law as the other well-known national daily papers throughout Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although Amendment No. 43 standing in the name of the hon. Member for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) and myself was not selected in your wisdom, Mrs. Jeger, the Minister of State will have noticed that our misgivings of the clause as it stands are shared by the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell), the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) and the official Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a prospective employer advertises in, say, 	<i>Newsletter</i> or the 	<i>Irish News</i> for a worker, there could be a presumption that that prospective employer wants a worker of a particular religious or political persuasion. On the other hand, if that prospective employer is expected to discharge his duty of non-discrimination by advertising in newspapers of different religious or political slants, then he will be put to expense, and it is unfair that an employer should be put to additional expense. Moreover, an employer might not wish to add to the advertising revenue
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
of a newspaper whose political or religious views he did not like. Personally, I should not wish to advertise for anybody in the 	<i>Protestant Telegraph,</i> and there are other newspapers that I would not wish to support by subsidising their advertising accounts. Therefore, I hope that the Minister of State will address himself to the misgivings which are shared throughout the Committee, although some hon. Gentlemen may have remained silent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To support what has already been said, we are merely concerned by the wording that it shall be unlawful to publish in Northern Ireland an advertisement which could reasonably be understood as indicated. The Minister will recall that in the Second Reading debate he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is really a Committee point, but the hon. Gentleman knows that anyone wishing to attract one section of the community puts an advertisement in either the 	<i>Irish News</i> or the 	<i>Protestant Telegraph</i> which will be seen by a certain section of the community. Under this Bill, such an advertisement would not only have to be non-discriminatory but would also have to be displayed on a basis by which both sides of the community could have access."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16th February 1976: Vol. 905.c.1010]</p></blockquote>
To achieve that, not only would the advertisement have to be carefully worded but it would have to be displayed in both the 	<i>Irish News</i> and the 	<i>Belfast Newsletter.</i> Is the Minister suggesting to employers in Northern Ireland that they must do what public authorities and Government bodies now do and advertise across the range of journals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful for some clarification from my right hon. Friend of the agency's role in relation to Clause 33. It is clear from a glance at Clause 36 that the agency has a function where an unlawful act has been committed and the agency thinks it is likely to continue. But I cannot see any provision which makes it the responsibility or even the prerogative of the agency to bring a prosecution under Clause 33. Again I ask whether, under Clause 33, there is any possibility of a private prosecution or whether, because the Act is unlawful and the penalty is prescribed in this clause, it would be open to the Director of Public Prosecutions as the alternative agency to take proceedings and, if it is not open to the DPP or a private person, where in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
Act is there provision which precludes the private person or the DPP taking action instead of the agency?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I further ask my right hon. Friend whether it is envisaged under Part IV that it should be open to an advertiser who has doubts or someone who knows of an advertisement which may give rise to doubt to consult the agency to obtain some kind of provisional determination whether it would regard that advertisement as admissible or inadmissible? if that is envisaged, can it be explained how far the court would be obliged to take into account the provisional determination by the agency in deciding whether someone was guilty of an offence if a prosecution was subsequently brought?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert J. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long, but I am concerned at the pessimism exhibited in the clause, which we believe is not warranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has already been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) to the right hon. Gentleman's words. There is an underlying assumption that each paper in Northern Ireland has a defined religious stance as well as a defined political one. We can understand a newspaper having a defined political stance, but we must remember that another part of the Bill clearly states that a political opinion is important because it provides a loophole for religious discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must at least try to accept that newspapers in Northern Ireland do not necessarily have a defined religious stance. If that is so, then I believe the pessimism, which is implicit in the wording of this clause, is unwarranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a second point to make—and here I call in aid the pragmatism of the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) who is always calling us back to the realities of the situation in Northern Ireland. There is one so-called Protestant morning newspaper, a Roman Catholic morning newspaper and an evening newspaper, which is middle-of-the-road. We should face great difficulty if the Protestant newspaper went out of existence and if we had to rely on the wording of the right hon. Gentelman's Second Reading speech. In order to cover the whole spectrum in Northern Ireland one would be forced to go into some of the peripheral publica-
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
tions. I should therefore like the right hon. Gentleman to address himself to that possibility. I am sure that is not what he intended by the wording of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.00 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. J. D. Concannon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To erase all doubt and suspicions that have been expressed, may I say that the intention of this clause is to cover all publications in Northern Ireland
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is fair to say, and it would be accepted that advertising practices can have a very significant effect on whether equality of opportunity is provided. For example, if an employer who advertises only in publications read exclusively or mainly by one section of the community were to watch out for applications from one side, it would mean that the other section would not have the chance to fill the vacancies. In such circumstances, it may be necessary for the agency to require the employer to advertise more widely and even to specify a publication to ensure that the advertismeent reaches all sections of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham) that there is no opportunity for a private prosecution. This matter is strictly for the agency. Clause 36 is the means of enforcing Clause 32 and only the agency will bring proceedings. Clause 43 excludes the proceedings by other persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) raised the question whether the publication of an advertisement in a journal which has a circulation restricted to people of a particular belief, would be contrary to Clause 33(1), because it could reasonably be understood to indicate an intention to discriminate. It would be for the courts to decide that matter, but I do not think that an advertisement which will not purport to discriminate in these terms could be unlawful merely because it was circulated in, say, a loyalist publication. To put it more shortly, Clause 33(1) is aimed at the content of the advertisement, and not at the journal in which it circulates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure we have been greatly helped by the last few sentences of the Under-Secretary's speech. Although it is never a popular thing to do in the situation he occupies, he has taken the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
opportunity of re-interpreting what was said on Second Reading by his right hon. Friend, whose words were:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An advertisement…in the 	<i>Protestant Telegraph—..</i> would not only have to be non-discriminatory but would also have to be displayed on a basis by which both sides of the community could have access."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16th February 1976: Vol. 905, c.10101</p></blockquote>
Picking one's way through the right hon. Gentleman's elegant wording, what does that add to the necessity of being non-discriminatory? The Under-Secretary has said that provided the advertisement is, on the face of it, non-discriminatory, one need not worry about the fact that it is in the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph.</i> It is unreasonable to be expected to advertise in six journals when one could adequately fulfil one's intentions by advertising in one or two. That is not what his right hon. Friend said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is possible—this happens to us all—that this is another example of what has been met in this Committee—an 	<i>obiter dictum,</i> something said by way of a marginal filigree contribution. Perhaps this goes some way to reinforce a salutary rule for occupants of the Front Bench during the course of a debate, namely, that when an hon. Member says something on which other hon. Gentlemen wish to comment, it is commonly wise for them to retain their seats until, the conclusion of the debate and then, upon due consideration, give him his desserts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this is an instance for which we will forgive the right hon. Gentleman. We are all fond of him. His characteristics and his readiness to jump in with his helpful comments during our speeches endear him to us. But I do think that, by his intervention, reported in column 1010, which my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh quoted, he raised a spectre which this debate ought to succeed in laying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When this Bill becomes an Act, every employer who advertises will have to take account of Clause 33 and will, therefore, want to know its effect. It was suggested at one stage—and I am not sure that I like the suggestion—that employers should go round to the agency and say "What view would you take if I were to put this advertisement in the 	<i>Protestant Telegraph?"</i> I should be sorry to think of the agency either setting itself up as an adviser on advertising channels or setting out to advise the public on what might or might
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
not be within the scope of their discretion, as applied by Clause 36.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have got, I believe, from the Under-Secretary is an assurance that in itself the journal chosen for advertisements will not be reasonably understood as indicating an intention to discriminate. I understood the Under-Secretary to say that, and am trying closely to follow his words, but he will appreciate how important clarity on this point is. He is, therefore, bidding us dismiss from our minds any notion that a non-discriminatory advertisement could be held to be within the mischief of Clause 33, simply because of the journal in which it appeared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I am not misrepresenting the Under-Secretary. If that is what he is assuring the Committee of, the official Opposition will, I am sure, be gratefully reassured and so will my hon. Friends and myself, and we shall all gladly forgive the right hon. Gentleman for having gone a little too far in his 	<i>obiter dicta</i> on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will reiterate, to make it absolutely clear, that Clause 33(1) is aimed at the content of the advertisement, not the journal in which it is circulated. But that is still to be read with what I said earlier, that in certain circumstances it may be necessary for the agency to require the employer to advertise more widely. So a lot will depend to a great extent on the agency which may well require publication in various papers to achieve equality of opportunity as defined in Clause 13. If one brings the two together, then I think one gets the position absolutely clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In other words, employers may be put to extra expense, which will not endear the Bill to them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bradford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was simply going to ask whether it would not be possible that such insistence in some cases would result in no advertising being placed at all. One may well dismiss the point about cost, but it is an important factor in the commercial life of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other point—just as an aside—is that if the Committee accepts that there is this rigidity within the newspaper world in Northern Ireland, that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
is a religious stance adopted by each and every newspaper there, it would appear that the easiest way to solve that problem would be to start work immediately on the newspapers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the assurances which have been given by my right hon. Friend. But I still have some doubt about certain publications. You will understand, Mrs. Jeger, as will Northern Ireland representatives here this morning, that we are treading on dangerous ground, because within the new circumstances of representation in Northern Ireland at present, it ill behoves any of us to make an enemy out of the Press in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Undoubtedly it will be duly reported by the evening newspaper in Belfast this evening, that newspapers can look forward to a rather dramatic increase in advertising revenue. I hope that that also applies to morning papers. But I see a difficulty. If an employer loses an employee on a Friday, and he wishes to get a replacement as quickly as possible, he will want to advertise. The first opportunity will be in the Saturday morning's local newspapers and Saturday evening's 	<i>Belfast Telegraph,</i> following on for the Monday and Tuesday. In relation to the wording of the advertisement which he proposes to place in the Press, I think he would be wise enough to know the terms of the Bill and not include the words Catholic or Protestant. But he will not have time to seek advice from anyone and could be contravening the spirt of the Bill by placing his advert in specific newspapers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends on this side of the Committee have posed the question: "Would it be advisable for an employer in such a position to seek the guidance or advice of the agency in the circumstances?" An employer may not have time to do that because he may want to fill the vacancy as quickly as possible and in such a case time is of the essence. He could find himself in difficulty. We know the reality, and again it has been referred to by the hon. Member for Belfast South (Mr. Bradford). In the city of Belfast the three main newspapers, the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph,</i> the 	<i>Newsletter</i> and the 	<i>Irish News—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend allow me? A lot of heavy weather is being made of this, and I wait to hear
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
what the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell) has got to say after those remarks about my speech on Second Reading which I do not retract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend talks about wanting to put an advertisement in a newspaper quickly, and to ensure that its publication is balanced. He would only need to put it in two morning newspapers to cover both communities in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pitt</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But will he have covered the whole community? Surely there are people within the Protestant community who read the 	<i>Irish News.</i> It would not be right to say that the 	<i>Newsletter</i> is a totally Protestant paper, any more than the 	<i>Irish News</i> is a totally Catholic newspaper. We know that when a publication is called the 	<i>Protestant Telegraph</i> there is no doubt what that paper is. But in what category would we put the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph?</i> I know that there are Catholics who, on reading the editorial in the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> sometimes, may think that it is a bigoted Unionist viewpoint. The next day it may write a reasonable editorial and people in the Loyalist community may think that it is as bad as the 	<i>Irish News.</i> That places the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> in a difficult position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Must there be compulsion, or do I take my right hon. Friend's words to mean what they say—that if one advertises in the 	<i>Irish News</i> and in the 	<i>Newsletter</i> that is all right? That seems to treat the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> unfairly, because it cannot be identified as being either Protestant or Catholic. Doubts may be raised there. My hon. Friend said, by way of an interjection, that if an employer wanted to fill a vacancy quickly and he advertised in the 	<i>Newsletter</i> and the 	<i>Irish News</i> the following morning, that would be taken as acting in a non-discriminatory way. But I think that the poor old 	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> should look to its laurels in this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Biggs-Davison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked whether it would be all right, and he seemed to suggest that it would, for an advertisement to be inserted in both the 	<i>Irish News</i> and in the Unionist newspaper. Do we take it that if he were a prospective employer, he would be happy to add to the advertising revenue of the Unionist paper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Undoubtedly the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Fitt) has made the substantial portion of our case. We are inflicting considerable extra expense upon hard-pressed businesses and employers. We are now told by the right hon. Gentleman that his words on Second Reading, and our understanding of them, have been reinforced. A person considering putting an advertisement in a morning paper in Northern Ireland at present must now consider putting advertisements in both morning papers, because, if he does otherwise he will be guilty of an unlawful act under this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point I wish to take up, which was briefly touched upon by the hon. Member for Belfast, West, is the fact that this legislation applies to all publications and journals in Northern Ireland. Is one suggesting—and I am not talking about the more scurrilous specialist Press such as the 	<i>Orange Standard</i> which is the official publication of the Orange Order in Northern Ireland—that if a person wishes to advertise, he should trot around and consider whether there is a duplicate publication in which he can advertise? Is someone suggesting that if one advertises in my own parish magazine for a handyman, one should consider going along to the local Catholic church and putting an advert in its magazine?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the logical extension of what the Minister is saying, if one must advertise, it must be done in such a way that it provides equality of opportunity to both sides of the community. I think that the Minister must defend this position better than we have heard so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said at the outset that the agency would, in effect, look at circumstances where advertisements were directed at only one section of the community in one Press. It may then be necessary for the agency to require the employer to advertise more widely. This is by a direction under Part II of the Bill. It means, in effect, that an employer who advertises in a mainly Protestant paper or a mainly Catholic paper which does not reach other sections of the community may be directed by the agency under Part II of the Bill to advertise more widely. We do not think that the cost of this will be unduly burdensome. Should that prove the case,
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
the respondent will be entitled to appeal to the Appeals Board under Clause 14 on the grounds that in all circumstances it is unreasonable to expect him to comply with the agency's direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That covers the point. We have made a lot of heavy weather on this particular issue, and we should now accept the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reference of the Under-Secretary to heavy weather was a little unfair. I never cease to marvel at the discoveries which one makes about the meaning of the Bill, through the simple process of debating a series of amendments on it, and of addressing oneself to the question that has been put to the Committee, "That the clause stand part of the Bill."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the last half hour's work—and it has been hard work for some of us—we have eventually arrived at an understanding of what the Minister meant by his intervention on Second Reading. Reading it in its context, and reading it as it stood, it was by no means as clear—and this is no complaint, for how can one be so clear in 10 lines in an intervention in someone else's speech—as it could have been as a result of half an hour spent in Committee. I respond to the invitation of the right hon. Gentleman to come to his assistance. If it was necessary to do so in order to do him justice, I would detain the Committee, if necessary, at almost unlimited length. In this case, however, it can be done, and done briefly, and I do it in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, in fact, two relevant provisions here for this matter of advertisement, and, although my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) in the context thought he was referring only—and indeed, was only referring—to unlawful and discriminatory acts, that is, to acts unlawful under Part III, the right hon. Gentleman's intervention in the Second Reading debate covered two separate matters. I think—perhaps the official Opposition will share my view—that this removes grounds for anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discovered that there are two separate matters. First, discriminatory advertisements—advertisements which are unlawful because they are discriminatory under Clause 3—have to be discriminatory by nature of their content and not of the place where they appear. On the other hand, if an employer were persisting in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
advertising only in one journal, in a context in which it was clear that the result—and, perhaps, the intended result—was the denial of equality of opportunity, then under Clause 13, which we have already added to the Bill, the agency would have the power to use its best endeavours to secure undertakings and bring into action the machinery of Part II. Therefore, we have succeeded in disentangling the Part II effect upon advertisements from the Part IV effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we can regard ourselves as having done good and laudable service in doing this. Indeed, had the right hon. Gentleman not given way to his helpful inclinations and intervened as he did during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh on Second Reading, I doubt whether this debate would have produced the desirable clarifications that it has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This might be viewed as a sweeping amendment in some respects but this matter of teachers lies at the very heart of the Bill and, indeed, of this whole problem. If there were no children to be taught we would have no need for teachers. They are in a key position in the community in Northern Ireland, and, indeed, in the whole country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been wisely said "Give me a child until he is seven years old and then you may do what you like with him". We all know and admit that the formative years of our lives are those years when we begin to acquire a certain amount of intelligence in our home and are subject to the directions of our parents and their teachings in one way and another. We all know that the early days of school more or less point the direction of our lives thereafter. They make for the mainstream of our lives and the direction they take in society and in our careers, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
while we may branch off into various tributaries of employment or profession, by and large the mainstream of our lives is determined in the early days of our schooling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I believe that a school teacher holds a key position in society. That is why I have proposed this amendment that teachers should be included in the Act and that there should be no discrimination of any kind in the teaching of the young. The teaching profession should be on one level, a national level. Young people should be taught from their earliest days the things that they need to be taught—the necessary education that will equip them for an academic or professional career, or a career in some of the arts and trades. I contend that the teacher is an important person who should be included rather than exempted from the terms of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been widely agreed over the past six or seven years in the province of Northern Ireland that much of the subsequent violence in young lives began at school level. The young people in teenage groups who are now the gunmen, the bombers, the fire raisers, the rabble rousers and the mobbers were just schoolchildren when the crisis started in Northern Ireland. We know that they had teachers, and I believe that teachers should be included in the Bill, that they should be responsible people just as much as employers, employees and businesses of all kinds. They should be included in this sphere of responsibility to the Fair Employment Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The teacher has a big job in the early days of a child's life. It is my personal belief and conviction that it should be the province of the Church—of whatever denomination—to supply religious teaching to children. In the sphere of education, teachers employed by the State should be included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, in many areas of Great Britain where there are large industrial centres with mixed populations which include Hindu and Moslem children, the introduction of religious education is something of a farce. The religious teachings of these children should be left to those of their particular religion. The teacher's job should be the teaching of such education
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
as is required for the befitting of young people for life and future employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At school level we have the beginnings of trouble. If we had a completely indiscriminate band of teachers throughout the whole community, we should largely eliminate much of the trouble that starts at school level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State will recall that I raised with him a case of two schoolboys—Crawford and Bresland—in the town of Strabane. They graduated from the local technical school and applied for and were admitted to the Government training centre in the City of Londonderry, which is approximately half an hour's bus ride from Strabane. Unfortunately these youths were Protestants, and as such they were subjected to discrimination of a violent kind. They were discriminated against in class; they were abused on the bus and in the confines of the training establishment. They came home from school at one stage bearing the visible marks of the discrimination and violence that was meted out to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the advice of their headmaster, a Mr. Thomson, the boys were withdrawn from the training establishment. He made an arrangement with the concurrence of the Dept. of Manpower Services, that they should be transferred to Ballymena, County Antrim, to continue their training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Orme</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman allow me to intervene? I am sure that he does not want to mislead the Committee. The facts that he has presented to the Committee are quite right, and I accept that there was discrimination against these boys. I very much regretted the incident and at the same time I did all that I could to try to remove the cause. However, the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that this had nothing at all to do with the headmaster or the teachers at the training college who did all they could to remove this discrimination. The discrimination was on the part of other pupils attending the training establishment. I should like to put that on record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunlop</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the right hon. Gentleman has said. However, the fact remains that the basic reason why these boys were persecuted was not that they looked or spoke differently or even had a different coloured skin. It was because they were Protestant and a large
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
number of pupils at the training establishment were Roman Catholics. This pinpoints the problem. It raises the question of the suitability of the Bill. Here we are again faced with the fact of geography and tradition. This area of Londonderry is largely Roman Catholic. These boys were discriminated against just because of their religion. They were forced out of the training establishment, away from their home for about five days every week. They had to obtain "digs" and live apart from their parents. I understand that their family were in what we understand as the lower income group and they could ill-afford the trouble, money and undoubted expense of having their boys trained in the trade they had chosen. That pinpoints this grave problem, namely, that if there were no such background to any teachings, young people would not have this feeling and they would not want to be bothered with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Bill is enacted, will it be possible for young Crawford and Bresland to return to Londonderry from Ballymena and have the protection of the Act? Would they be able to carry on their training under the protection of an Act of Parliament that cuts out discrimination of any kind?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has been referred to as a vast umbrella of protection for all sections of the community. I again want to pinpoint what I said earlier this morning, that teachers should be included in this matter. Could redress for these two young boys be effected under the Act of Parliament? If Crawford and Bresland were brought back, could they travel by bus every day and enjoy the fellowship of their father and mother for five days of the week which they do not have now? Will this Act ensure that they receive that protection and that which is the basic right of all young people wherever possible, namely, to be in their own homes under the protection and guidance of their own parents and with the protection of an Act of Parliament designed to make it possible for them to engage in training for their life's work without any discrimination or persecution?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have briefly stated this case, having gone into all the implied points, and I moved the amendment to ask that teachers be included in the scope of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William van Straubenzee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When one is in Committee in favour of legislation, unless it is a major or probing point, one does not seek to intervene unduly. That is why in earlier stages I have deliberately not intervened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you know, Mrs. Jeger, I am firmly in favour of the Bill, having had something to do with that which went before. I want to make it quite clear that I am not going to vote against this clause. May I deal with this and the two subsequent clauses, which form one part, Mrs. Jeger?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the first time that we have departed radically, and perhaps rightly, from recommendations which were made in the Committee over which I presided—a committee which I have not once recognised realistically in many of the descriptions of the men and women who worked with me and who produced the Report. I do not recognise in them the spineless individuals who, worm-like, agreed to everything that the Government said and who are totally unrepresentative of opinion in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The members of my committee were aware of the sensitivity of the issue. I am refreshing my memory of the actual wording which was used in this clause. You will remember, Mrs. Jeger, that we came to the conclusion that the right way forward in education was to make an exception only where religion is a 	<i>bona fide</i> professional qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a great deal of sympathy with the general view put by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop). I hope he will allow me a little wry amusement that he now wants to extend the purposes of a Bill of which up to now he fundamentally disapproved. I think his change of mind and heart is right. Let us hope it is extended right along this bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is right that the tragic division of education in Northern Ireland between Catholic and Protestant exists—a typically Northern Irish division, if hon. Members of Northern Ireland constituencies will allow me—because while it is recognised publicly that there are Catholic schools, it is not recognised publicly that there are Protestant schools. Protestant schools are State schools. The State is Protestant, or is designed to be, and there was therefore no need to call them Protestant schools. One therefore only had to identify the unfortunate Catholics as being the only people who have Church schools, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
is unrealistic. There are both Catholic and Protestant schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have experienced a number of tragic moments in Northern Ireland, but I do not remember anything more tragic than the Christmas reunion in a part of Belfast of a large group of young people brought from both sides of the community for a reunion, having been in a summer camp together. They came in from separate doors on either side, warmly and enthusiastically embraced each other, had a tremendous tea party together, and then went their separate ways. I thought that in those few moments we saw the heart of the real tragedy of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the hon. Gentleman is right and that progressively we should move towards a greater integration of schooling in Northern Ireland. If the young people are brought up in almost total isolation from each other, one builds up that which endures, namely, totally false beliefs about each other which do not add up to harmonious relationships later. But this is a highly sensitive issue where we must proceed with caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am under the impression, without in any way revealing confidential discussions, that at that time there was widespread agreement to the concept outlined in the Report of which I was chairman. I can well understand if subsequent discussion has revealed anxiety. My impression from consultations I have had is that there is anxiety just as much on the Protestant as on the Catholic side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman will reflect for a moment on the situation of which he has more experience than I, but of which I have some knowledge, the sudden transformation to a situation where on any subject a Roman Catholic teacher could possibly be considered alongside, and on equal terms with, a Protestant teacher for a post is one which I suspect would cause very considerable anxiety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCusker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman accept that when I was a teacher I taught both Catholics and Protestants in what might be considered to be a very difficult area of Lurgan? As a pupil in Lurgan College I was taught for six years by two Roman Catholic teachers without any conflict.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. van Straubenzee</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is the kind of school where the issue would be anything like as extreme as the kind of which I have spoken. I do not want to identify individual areas, but we can think of areas where I very much doubt that that would apply. Although I rejoice in what the hon. Gentleman said, I hope it still applies as widely in the present difficult conditions and I rejoice that it should. I want to do everything I can to encourage it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed at the reticence of a number of education authorities in Northern Ireland. Again it is not helpful to identify them, but a number of them on both sides are not taking a sufficiently big view about progress in the area of infant education and nursery schools. That is where we could have made progress with a little more give on both sides. But we are here considering it to be a matter of the law. So I am expressing my reservations today because I would regard it otherwise as discourteous, as this discussion may well, after three clauses, move over to our next sitting, and I should like to make it clear that I shall be absent on duty of the House at our next sitting, as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is visiting my constituency in the morning. I would not, therefore, wish it to be thought discourteous to you, Mrs. Jeger, or to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am today, therefore, expressing my anxiety about the effect of the three clauses and asking the Minister if, when he replies, he will give us a general assurance that the Government will operate these three clauses in the general spirit of wanting to make progress towards the objective we all have in mind; that they will do so consciously and determinedly, bit by bit and move by move, so that they could operate the provisions which will follow and which the Committee will look at in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can have that put on the record, I shall be quite happy to accept the clause, without the amendment proposed by the hon. Gentleman. I am at one with him on the main objective, as I can think of few things which would be more beneficial to understanding and the education of young people who are at the most informative and impressionable period of their lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Powell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have had the benefit of hearing from the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee). I was unkind enough at an earlier stage to describe him as running mute. May I make amends by trusting that his present disabilities do not arise from having caught a cold from sitting in his shirt sleeves in this Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was right that the hon. Member should have been heard on what is one of the most important debates at this stage of the Bill. He found—and I think that we shall all find, subject to your guidance, Mrs. Jeger—that it is difficult in discussing this amendment to keep apart the provisions of the following two clauses, even though there are specific amendments, which we shall come to on Clause 39.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) opened up by his speech one of the sharpest and oldest political divisions in British politics. I say "British" advisedly, for it is perhaps ironical to remember that the issue of State—secular education or religious education, church schools—was tearing the parties and the electorate apart in Great Britain, certainly in England and Wales, exactly at the time when the Home Rule issue in Ireland was entering upon a new phase in the years on either side of 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I came late in life to represent a constituency in Northern Ireland. In my 25 years as Member for an English seat I have stoutly defended in public the principle of church schools which, put the other way round, is the principle of the right of parents to secure that their children are educated within the environment and, therefore, preponderantly by teachers belonging to their own religious faith. I find it impossible, because one has moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, to unsay what was said, or not to claim the same right for constituents in that part of the United Kingdom, as I believe they ought to have in all other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To say that, of course, is not to be blind to the different political setting and historical setting of church schools in Northern Ireland, but it is to say that I do not believe that we can begin at what, in my judgment, would be the wrong end. I do not believe that because we find that the divisions and conflicts of Northern Ireland are associated with differences of
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
church and of religion, we can wisely attempt to heal those divisions, or deprive them of their harmful aspects, by going straight to the discrimination which is explicit, of course, in the maintenance of schools with a religious affiliation, of church schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not referring to the hon. Member for Wokingham, but I have been irritated—and I can imagine how much more Ulster people have been irritated—by those from over the water who have paid them visits and who have been pleased to observe "All this could be dealt with if only all the children could go to the same school. If only we could break down the religious division at the school level, how happy everything would be, and when are we going to make a start?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, I appreciate the point of view of my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Ulster. It is part of his outlook upon religion, upon the State and the relationship between the two, as much as what I am saying is part of my outlook upon that relationship. This is a subject on which it is right and natural for individual hon. Members to take different viewpoints from those with whom they are most closely allied on other subjects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only is it essential that these words should be here, but it would be totally and damagingly unrealistic for them not to be, but any move taken within the scope of the Bill away from the meaning of those two lines which my hon. Friend proposed to delete must be extremely cautious and will probably be much more remote than many people at the moment envisage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In saying that, I am not giving vent to pessimism about the future of Northern Ireland and the future prospects of a peaceable life for its inhabitants. I would indeed despair and be pessimistic if I thought that prospect was dependent upon the elimination of religion from the educational system of that province, but I do not believe that it is. However deeply entangled be politics and religion, I believe that we have to start at the political end and believe that this is what, in fact, is happening, perhaps after a process of exhaustion, in recent months, and is what, perhaps, will beneficially continue to broaden in the months to come. That is, the detachment of the issue of the legitimacy of the State from the religious beliefs of those who live within the State. It is from that direction
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
that I personally hope for the radical improvement in the conditions of life which we all want to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the significance of Part V is that it raises the question: from which end do we start? Do we seize the problem of the sectarian side—if I may use that much overused and misused word—or do we seize it from the political side? I believe that Part V is right in its approach. I believe that Part V is right in saying that here is an area which we are going to leave—at any rate for the forseeable future—outside the scope of these provisions. It would be unwise, it might even he disastrous, if we had taken an alternative course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although my hon. Friend did a service to the Committee in moving the amendment and putting forward his point of view, I hope that the ultimate decision of the Committee will be to retain paragraph (	<i>c</i>) in this subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Farr</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mrs. Jeger. I wish to seek clarification in relation to Clause 37, which is an extremely important clause. The Committee will see that there are three groups of amendments which have been selected by you in your wisdom for discussion. They are Amendments Nos. 44 and 45; and Nos. 137 and 138 together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 37 is so important and becomes so complex that, as we have already heard during the discussion on Amendment No. 44, the arguments are interwoven. I seek your assurance, Mrs. Jeger, that you will not rule out a substantial debate, if necessary, on "Clause stand part". While individual arguments can be made to each group of amendments, there are other arguments which should and ought to be deployed when looking at the clause as a whole, and possibly relating the whole group of amendments together. It is with that purpose only in mind that I seek an assurance from you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, it is difficult to give an assurance on a hypothetical question. However, I can say to the Committee that I shall look upon this matter with my usual generosity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Concannon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of this amendment would be to remove from the Bill
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
the provision that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parts II to IV shall not apply to or in relation to…employment as a teacher in a school."</p></blockquote>
The Working Party felt that, apart from exemptions needed for phasing in of the work load, ministers of the church, private households, and where religion is a 	<i>bona fide</i> qualification, there should be no general exemption from the provisions of the legislation. It did, however, recognise the existence of categories of employment having a particular religious character or ethos, in particular in the educational field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After long discussions—and I can say long discussions because I remember during the Second Reading debate having to relate most of my winding-up speech to this particular subject—with religious and education authorities in Northern Ireland and the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights, it has been decided that teachers in schools should be exempted but that the exemption should be continuously reviewed by the agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To apply the Bill to teachers in schools would be seen as an attack on the dual system of education. Whatever may be the merits of that system, the right way to alter it, if it is to be altered, is to do so directly, not as a consequence of a measure to deal with the different problem of equality in employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To remove the exemption at this time would not only offend the religious and education authorities and the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights; it would also antagonise many people against the Bill and possibly be seen as the Government's back-door method of introducing a non-segregated system of education. We have had continual discussion by both sides of the community about this issue, and they both have the same worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general terms it is understood that pupils and staff at controlled schools are mainly Protestant. At voluntary schools they are mainly Roman Catholic. The purpose of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Bill is to deal with discrimination in employment. It is certainly not the appropriate forum for changing the whole educational structure in Northern Ireland, to which I think the hon. Gentleman was alluding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, provision is made in Clause 39 for the Secretary of State to vary or remove completely the exemption for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>435</span>
teachers in schools. Furthermore, the agency may report to the Secretary of State as necessary, or whenever the Secretary of State may require, and make recommendation on further equality of opportunity in the employment of teachers in schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Mr. Dunlop) moved his amendment with obvious sincerity. But I think that as a result of the on-going talks which we have
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
had with various religious groups in Northern Ireland, he will seek to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
