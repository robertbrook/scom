	<p>[Mr. ARTHUR JONES 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>INDUSTRIAL COMMON OWNERSHIP BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that Government new Clause 1—	<i>Grants and loans—</i>has been read a Second time. Certain amendments to it have already been disposed of, and the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) is in course of moving his Amendment (f), in line 29, leave out
	<br><q><p>' and to include amongst its members one or more representatives of trade unions '.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the amendment which would leave out the requirement to include one or more representatives of trade unions on the body which would advise the Secretary of State on matters concerning common-owned firms. As I said last week, there is a case eventually for reasonable-minded men to say that there is no need for us to legislate further to place the trade union movement in a privileged position above all others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is curious that the requirement is not that there should be trade unionists on this body but that there should be representatives of trade unions, which is rather different. What is the rôle of these people? Is it to advance the cause of common-owned businesses, or is to represent the interests of trade unions? Presumably, as they would be representatives of trade unions, it is to advance the interests of trade unions. Those two aims may conflict from time to time. It seems to me that then the representatives of trade unions would be personally in an invidious position—indeed, in an immoral position—in that they would be able to block or damage the advance of the interests of common-owned firms in order to advance the interests of the trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Press on Monday, or perhaps Tuesday, there was a story about the degree of concern which exists among leading members of trade unions about the ways in which the power of patronage
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
is used already in this country. That related to the particular case of a certain gentleman who was retiring from his post as a full-time trade union official and how he was becoming surprisingly well endowed with State jobs He had received two well paid appointments from a Minister who was a Member of Parliament sponsored by his trade union, and he was in the process of receiving a third such appointment. It was causing a good deal of pain to the secretary of another trade union who felt that this was getting a bit much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should consider carefully whether it is in the best interest of the trade union movement that its members should be constantly placed in such a privileged position. I know that the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Huckfield) is a sponsored Member of the same union as that which had received such benefits for one of its former members recently. I know that the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) is sponsored by another union, and so is the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Rodgers). It seems to me that they are taking their rôle as sponsored Members too far. They are seeing their sponsorship now as a means by which they put the trade unions which put them here into privileged positions above everybody else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do we need representatives of trade unions on this body at all? What are they there for? What is their rôle in relation to common-owned firms? If everybody is the boss, if the firm is owned by all those there concerned, what is it that these trade union representatives will fight for? What sort of advice could they give to the Minister through this body which would be so different from that of people who are actually running or who have had experience in running common-owned firms? Is it for any good purpose that we should have these people on the body, or is it merely that it has now become the custom that the trade union movement, through the TUC, demands a seat on everything as the price of its acquiescence in a statutory incomes policy? Is that what it is? Do we have to buy them off all the time by putting them on the boards of pension funds, putting them in the chair of industrial training boards, and now even putting them into this little body? Surely, it is not such a commanding height of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
economy that the TUC must be represented there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does "representatives of trade unions" mean? Does it mean just a chap who happens to be a member of a trade union, or someone who is sent by a trade union to represent its interest?, Which does it mean? How will the Minister discover whether the person concerned is representing the trade union as opposed to merely representing himself? Is he supposed to have a brief about any important matters from his masters, or is he supposed to be a free agent?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be well advised to delete this subsection of the clause, not necessarily out of any feeling that even the Trades Union Congress, the trade union movement at the top, is now unduly powerful and should not have its power extended but out of respect for the common ownership movement in this country, which does not have to have tied to it a representative—a delegate—someone who turns back all the time to the trade union movement before he decides what he can do and say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will support me when we vote to delete this odious provision from the Minister's Bill, especially as is was not a provision of the original Bill when it was first laid before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reluctant to take part in our debate as I felt we were very short of time, but the rather provocative speech of the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit), who has been so co-operative so far, merits some observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has referred to the appointment of a retired trade union official to the chairmanship of a training board. Until two years ago, not one chairman of any of our numerous training boards was a trade unionist. Today there are only two trade unionists who are chairmen of training boards. The other is Hugh Scandon, who is chairman of the engineering training board. The chairmen of the other boards are invariably directors of firms, managers or technicians, all with great interest in industry. The trade uinon movement has never objected to those appointments. Surely, just two chairmanships among all these training
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
boards is not an exploitation by the trade union movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, but I think that I can help the hon. Member. I am certainly not opposed to trade unionists being appointed as chairmen of training boards; that is not the point. But the manner of the appointment had been criticised not by the employers but by other trade unionists. I am sounding a warning to hon. Members and to trade unionists and others outside that the powers of patronage now in the hands of Ministers are probably excessive and may well be used unwisely, against the interests of trade unionists as well as against the interests of the rest of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gathered from the hon. Gentleman's remarks that he was making an issue of it. The facts are that the two trade unions involved in the construction industry thought that their representative should be the chairman of that training board. The person concerned was a national officer for the construction industry, a man of great wisdom and experience, who would make a very important contribution to that board. It is a little conflict between two unions, which is quite understandable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the president of the Industrial Common Ownership Movement. I was elected unanimously at two of its annual conferences. Although I am a retired trade union official, I am still the chairman of a trade union international body. The people who elected me were representative of all the firms which had membership in the Industrial Common Ownership Movement—all the associate members. They considered that a trade union man with considerable experience—over 30 years in industry—was an asset to the development of industrial common ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that this new body, whose purpose will be to encourage voluntary common ownership, needs the advice of the trade union movement. After all, it is the workers in the trade unions who dig the coal, make the steel, run our transport and our hotels, who staff our Houses of Parliament and who do the work of our world. Are they not to be consulted in the development of common ownership firms?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0358">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>75</span>
The most important of the pioneers in industrial common ownership in this country is the Scott Bader Commonwealth. It all started in my trade union office 25 years ago. I have been associated with that development from its very beginning. It would not have got off the ground without the support of the chemical workers' union. It would not have functioned at all. That is recognised by everbody involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment. Our trade union movement represents 12 million workers, 10 million of whom are affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. With their families, that represents about 30 million people. We have reached a stage in the development of our economy when we are becoming more and more syndicalist-minded, in its proper perspective. When I say syndicalist-minded, I mean that our economy will not function any more without massive consultation between both sides of industry. Any new development towards common ownership demands the active co-operation of the trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking here not about groups of trade unionists joining this modest body but about representatives. It could be one, or two—no more. It will not necessarily be a trade union national officer. It could be a shop steward, full of wisdom, running a shop at the level of production, or it could be an ordinary trade unionist. it is for the body to decide, but we need the co-operation of the trade union movement if this development towards voluntary common ownership is to make any reasonable impact on our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman because it seems that we are much closer together than at first appeared. If an amendment were to be brought forward at a later stage saying
	<br><q><p>"and to include among its members one or more trade unionists"</p></q>
none of us would find that odious. But what is proposed is
	<br><q><p>"representatives of trade unions."</p></q>
Of course, it is sensible that trade unionists should be there. It is wholly desirable—indeed, almost inevitable. What is not desirable is that they should represent trade unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not for me to decide. It is for the promoter of the Bill to do so. I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) has said. However, a representative of a trade union represents people, a lot of people, he is not somebody who represents just himself or who is a trade unionist. We can have a little dialogue on this issue, but I should not want to commit the promoter to accepting the modified approach suggested by the hon. Member for Chingford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Esmond Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly take up some of the questions raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit)? First, it would be helpful if the promoter of the Bill could tell us whether he has discussed this matter with the trade union movement. From our debates, it seemed possible that he might find certain advantages in formal trade union identity. We discussed the question of funds and whether, in certain circumstances, individual trade unions might make funds available. The question of expertise lies much more on the industrial relations side, the human side, rather than on the financial and commercial side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem that some of the firms which come into common ownership do so through the failure of an existing company, sometimes through bad industrial relations. I take the example of the 	<i>Scottish Daily Express.</i> There had been a series of strikes, and the situation was progressively deteriorating. To have formal trade union representation on a body which was seen subsequently to take over the firm, where the motives of some of those involved might be questioned, would not necessarily help in getting the new common ownership off the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has dwelt on the question of having "representatives of trade unions" or "trade unionists". Quite rightly, he made the point about patronage. Do we understand that these representatives would be TUC-appointed, or at least TUC-approved? Does this mean that the larger unions would come first? Could there be some question of an inter-union dispute, particularly where a firm which went bust had operated a closed shop? Would somebody be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
brought on to this body who represented that union?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Price) said that he would like to see a coal mine operated as a common ownership scheme. Many of us have much sympathy with that. What would the position of the trade union be if all the workers in the mine were its common owners? At best, it would be that of a super-management consultancy. At least, I think that that would be the position, because its first loyalty should be to the common-owned enterprise, that is, to the mine. Therefore, what would the function of the trade union be in that position? It might be to offer advice, but that advice might equally well come from other quarters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition cannot see why the emphasis should be solely on trade union representation and not, perhaps, on other expertise which would be equally valuable. Why should there not be some representative of the accountancy profession or the Institute of Marketing, or members of the ICOM or others who could offer help? We feel that the present wording introduces an unnecessary note of dissension into the Bill, and perhaps the promoter or the Minister will comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. loan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand the attitude of the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit). At the last sitting he was exhorting us to encourage the trade union movement to put its money where its mouth was and support workers' co-operatives. What we are discussing on the Bill is a pump-priming operation. We want the Government to start it off, but we hope that it will be extended and that the co-operative movement will be considered. They object to the phrase:
	<br><q><p>"to include among its members one or more representatives of trade unions."</p></q>
I hope that it will be possible for the TUC, at the invitation of the Government, to have a representative on this body. I am glad to carry the hon. Member for Chingford with me—I thought that I was, for he was nodding his head. If we are to appeal to the trade union movement to put money into this, as well as the Government, I should welcome the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
trade union movement saying, "This body has been set up. The Government are giving so much and we intend to give so much more."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that there will be many common-owned firms which can raise money from banks, insurance companies and other institutions. But I should net dream of putting in a requirement that there should be representatives of the banks and insurance companies on this body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between a bank that puts money into a common ownership concern and a body like the trade union movement which has over 10 million members. Trade union negotiators know what is going on in certain trades, and they would bring a certain expertise and national backing to this body which should be welcomed. I welcome the fact that the trade unions would be represented, although if it is the desire of the Government to bring in people with financial expertise from companies or whatever—I hope, by the way, that they do not come from Lonrho—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the London Co-operative Society, after the pension fund affair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the co-operative movement will come in. The hon. Member talks about the activities of certain commercial enterprises and democratic organisations. There is a difference. I have sat on a workers' co-operative co-partnership concern, and there were workers from the floor of a printing firm who knew what was going on inside the firm. But they were also trade union representatives. They were not, incidentally, appointed by the trade unions; they were voted for by the workers on the factory floor as well as the members. So they had some say in what trade union representatives were coming on to that body. They brought a tremendous knowledge. There were people in the printing industry, for instance, who knew what was required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will resist the amendment and that we shall have, as the hon. Member for Chingford said, a great involvement of the trade union movement. If we are to ask them for their money, let us have them on this body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0360">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very interested by this debate. What is this body intended to do? It is intended to encourage the development of common ownership. There is no argument between us in the Committee, and, indeed, in the House of Commons about that. We agree that it is a desirable objective. The Government have only to satisfy themselves that the purpose of the body which is an applicant for Government money is to encourage the development of common ownership before deciding whether it is a suitable body to give money to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two things strike me about the debate. First, there is the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) that this provision was not originally thought necessary. The Bill is promoted and sponsored by hon. Members who need yield to nobody in their knowledge of the requirements and interests of the common ownership movement. The speech we have had today from the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Edwards) reminds us of his deep experience of and support for this movement. Therefore, there is quite a big question mark in my mind as to the desirability of this provision. Why was it that the Bill, coming from the stable it comes from, did not contain it in the first instance?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, one notices that the representative—or one or more representatives—of the trade unions is the only category of person whom it is proposed to stipulate shall be included in the body that is a candidate for Government support. Again, I ask why that should be the case. As has already been mentioned, it is not difficult to imagine more than one other category of person whose services, expertise and experience would be just as valuable on this body—employers, for example. One is in great danger if we stipulate one particular obligatory category of person, and one is bound to ask what the real reason for it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that I am still new in the House, but the first Standing Committee I served on was the Health and Safety at Work etc. Bill. I wanted to serve on that, because I have had some experience in my professional life of matters concerned with industrial safety, which is a subject of abiding interest to me. One of the provisions of that Bill, which I thought rather shocking—and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
still do—is that safety committees, for which statutory provision was made for the first time in the Bill, were stipulated to be staffed by trade union members only. Only trade unionists could be members of the safety committee. That seemed to me to be profoundly wrong, although it is of the highest importance that trade unionists should be represented on those committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I shall not be ruled out of order, because there is an analogy, or a potential analogy, here. It seemed to me that in that instance the Government were introducing into the cause of industrial safety and the promoting of industrial safety, with which we all agreed, a different interest—the promotion of trade union membership. That seemed to me to be wrong and capable of harming the cause of industrial safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is not being suggested that we can draw a parallel between the proposed legislation here and the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. This Bill simply calls for one or more trade union representatives—a very modest requirement surely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that would be true, but unfortunately it arouses the suspicion in my mind that, because only one category is being proposed as an obligatory member of the board or the body, the same motivation is present. I cannot see any reason why this stipulation should be made. I hope that either the Minister or the hon. Gentleman promoting the Bill will be able to give me some reason to dispel my suspicion that we are here seeing the further extension of the policy of the Government to extend the representation of trade union representatives ever more widely in bodies and corporations far more than is justified by the true interests of the trade union movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what worries me about the Bill. I think that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-East is absolutely right in pointing to the contribution that trade union members and those experienced in trade union administration can make to bodies of this kind. I should be surprised if many bodies were ultimately set up which did not of their own volition wish to incorporate at least one person of such experience in their number. But on the argument that I have heard so

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
far, I do not want to see this obligatory provision included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and important debate. I was by no means least impressed by the contribution of the hon. and learned Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Mayhew) who speaks from considerable legal experience. I was very interested in his references to his membership of the Committee on the Health and Safety at Work etc. Bill. He may recollect that I also served on that Committee and was even successful in pressing some amendments upon the Government. a little reluctantly at first but nevertheless with eventual success. I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman speaks from considerable interest in that subject and also from a considerable and distinguished legal career, often representing trade unionists in accident compensation cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And employers, as the hon. and learned Gentleman interjects. As the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) said in moving the amendment, I am a sponsored trade union Member in this House. The Committee might be interested to know that when I left school at the age of 16 and started to serve my apprenticeship, I began work on a Monday morning and of my own volition I joined the AEU, as it then was, on the Tuesday morning. I am extremely proud of the fact that I have had a continuous membership of the same branch ever since, including a suspended membership during service in the Armed Forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that as a lifelong trade unionist and as the honorary secretary of the AUEW parliamentary group, I might be felt to have some emotional involvement. That emotional involvement might be enhanced by the remarks of the hon. Member for Chingford that I and others who are sponsored trade union candidates and Members were seeking to use the Bill to put those who put us here—to quote his words—in a privileged position. I remind the hon. Gentleman that I was put here by a majority of the voters in the Consett parliamentary constituency. Perhaps every hon. Member did not have an absolute majoritly in a three-cornered
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
fight as I did, but every hon. Member, irrespective of where he sits in the Committee or in the House, was put here because more people voted for him in his constituency than voted for any other candidate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we all accept that, but we are all also very realistic. We know that I carried many thousands of votes more than anybody else did in my constituency, as the hon. Member did in his constituency, but none the less, it was getting the nomination, both in Chingford for the Conservative Party and in Consett for the Labour Party, which really made a great deal of difference as to whether we were elected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue this too closely, Mr. Jones, but—since we are entering into this type of discussion—when I appeared before the selection conference of 167 voting delegates at Consett, there were just 18 who were mandated to vote for me from my trade union; they were wholly outnumbered by the others. I am certain that the hon. Gentleman faced a not dissimilar situation in his own constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was saying that I might be felt to speak from a position of some emotion, but I want to try to speak to the Committee from a position of reason. We are talking about the "relevant body", as it is referred to in the clause. Above all, that relevant body must be generally representative of all those who have an involvement or an interest in common ownership. Clearly, it will be constituted of people with experience and knowledge of common ownership enterprises, able to make impartial but, above all, informed and strict judgments on applications which may be submitted to it. It may very well include trade unionists because, as my hon. Friend the Member
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>83</span>
for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Edwards) pointed out—and my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) also touched upon this—there are many trade unionists who have this kind of qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no less important that the body must include independent representatives of people who are employed in the generality. We are talking about firms which might seek to convert to common ownership, or about common ownerships which might seek financial help for conversion. I am not suggesting that the body should change its composition every time an application is made, although clearly it would want to consult with trade unionists as well as with management in such concerns. But I believe also that, in the generality, it is important for this body to include representatives of trade unionists in a broader fashion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Woolwich, West (Mr. Bottomley) made some extremely important points, first in an intervention in my own speech—which was recognised as a very important and pertinent one—and also in his own speech. He said that it was important to maintain the independent right of trade unions to represent the workers in common ownership enterprise. I accept absolutely that there is such a right. Even where the people employed will be—as they will—equal partners in the concern, it is nevertheless important for them to have this sort of independent representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see it, subsection (5) of the new clause does that in relation to the body which will be responsible for the disbursements, both for common ownership enterprises and for those who are seeking conversion. It would seem to me that the inclusion of a reference to trade unionists is a very reasonable proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Member help the Committee by giving some indication of what size he believes this body might be, and what proportion of the total membership trade union representatives might comprise?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to make any firm commitment about the size of the body. It will be a matter of appointment by the Secretary of State once the body is constituted. My own feeling is that it would be a relatively
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>84</span>
small body with the capacity to consult very widely with trade unions, managements, and so on. I would think in terms of a relatively small body with the directly appointed trade union members probably constituting a minority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Member point out where it is proposed that the Secretary of State should appoint this body? I do not want to be left confused, and I am sure the hon. Gentleman would not wish to confuse the Committee. I understand the body is not actually appointed by the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I take that point. It is where the Secretary of State recognises that a body exists. Clearly, whilst not directly making the appointments, he would not recognise such a body unless he approved of the appointments. The hon. Gentleman has made a valid point. It would not be a direct appointment but, clearly, the body would have to be approved by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish now to respond to the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Bulmer), who asked me if I had discussed with trade unions the question of appointments, their financial attitude, and so on, which was raised at last week's sitting of the Committee. I noted the points made, and I think I indicated my general sympathy at that stage. However I must inform the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that I have not in the intervening week been able to have any such discussions. Any discussions regarding appointments to a body must await the passage of the Bill. But the principle of important trade union contributions where there are existing common ownership enterprises is clearly an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I cannot see that those appointed as members of trade unions on the relevant body would be in a more privileged or invidious position than any other members of the body. The body as constituted will be a corporate body in its own right, bringing to bear its knowledge and experience in the matter of disbursements to companies seeking to convert or to existing common ownerships. It would be a strange position if there were to be no trade union representative amongst the membership of a body constituted specifically for that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>85</span>
sort of purpose, and for the encouragement and development of common ownership enterprises. The Bill attempts to further a new concept of industrial democracy, and I should have thought that the advantages of ensuring that trade union advice was readily available were self-evident and valuable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so gently, I think the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) has totally missed the point. One of the main questions was why it was necessary to put in the new clause these extra words saying that the only part of "any relevant body" which will be specified by the House shall include one or more representatives of trade unions. We have not heard the promoter of the Bill say why this comes into the new clause when it was not included when the Bill was first put before the House. It would be not a deliberate discourtesy, but certainly a mistake if he and the sponsors of the Bill were not able to explain that to the Committee this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can answer that briefly. Any Bill which is introduced into the House has additions or subtractions made to it subsequently. This is perfectly in order. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is not I who am missing the point, it is he, in trying to assume that there is some sinister motive in this; there is not. The reason why it is in the Bill now rather than at the beginning is because we have realised the importance of having it in, which we had not done in the initial stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that intervention but I do not agree with it. I was not suggesting that the addition in the new clause is out of order, because clearly that would be a reflection on you, Mr. Jones. I believe that it is self-evident to the sponsors of the Bill that when a relevant body is established, which hopes to have the approval of the Secretary of State, it would include among its membership those who are thought to be suitable, not only as individuals, but also as representatives of various interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my recollection no one has suggested what the full range of membership might be; clearly it might vary, because we also note that the new clause talks about "any relevant body". It does not talk about one particular body which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
may have only one form of membership. There is a clear indication in the new clause that more than one body can be recognised by the Secretary of State, and grants may be made through more than one body. I hope this is the understanding that others have of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is clear to most of us that a relevant body will be likely to include someone who is a trade union member—the chances that it will are one in two anyway, because, as we all know, one worker in two is a member of a trade union—one is left with the question of whether that body, when it is formed, is likely to include a representative of a trade union, and presumably, since again the words are not defined in the new clause or the Bill, one has to ask what a representative of a trade union is. Is it someone who is officially nominated by the TUC or through informal channels within the trade union movement? It is left very unclear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trying to discover why these words have been added is beyond me unless one starts thinking that it is part of the general deal between the various parts of the trade union movement. It would be regrettable if the sponsors of the Bill were willing to accept that we should leave these words in because it would introduce a very partisan tone to the deliberations on the Bill and on the new clause which all of us would like to see avoided. We know that in the House we shall have a long debate about the White Paper on pension funds, where we hear that 50 per cent. of the members shall be nominated by trade unions. We shall find much the same in many other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it regrettable that, just to establish a principle which has not so far been effectively defended, we have this proposal forced on what is, I hope, a nonpolitical Committee considering a nonpolitical Bill which will, we hope, extend the opportunities for the expansion of industiral democracy, as someone put it—though I would describe it as the industrial democracy, as someone put it ship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to see a body set up which has on it a trade union member, who could be someone like myself, who was only one of the 3 million trade union members who vote for and support the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
Conservative cause, because that would be a travesty, and perhaps a parody of what is intended. I do not suggest that there should not be a trade union member on the relevant body. What I strongly object to is that the Government—presumably, it is the Government, because the promoter did not feel it necessary to put this in—want to write into the new clause that the only members of the relevant body to be specified shall be
	<br><q><p>"one or more representatives of trade unions."</p></q>
Let us consider where industrial common ownership firms may be established, where the people at work may wish to set up such a system. They may just as likely come from the 12 million or 15 million people at work who are not members of trade unions as from those who are members of trade unions. Whatever individual trade unionists may feel, the fact is that those who make up the 15 million people at work who are not members of trade unions have just as much right to set up an industrial common ownership scheme as have the 10 million or 12 million at work who are presently members of trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be—clearly, the new clause envisages this possibility—that more than one relevant body will be established. I, for one, would regret it, but it is quite possible that more than one relevant body was established, one to establish industrial co-ownership firms among those who are members of trades unions and another relevant body recognised by the Secretary of State for the majority of people who are not in trade unions. I am not suggesting that that is likely, but it is possible. In that case, hung round the neck of the second relevant body would be the requirement to have representatives of trade unions. If it had any sense, it might decide that it wanted to have such representatives anyway, but I do not see why the House and this Committee should wrap this requirement round its neck from the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the Committee an example. Before I came into the House, I was involved in a small electrical firm the employees of which were nearly all in the ETU and NATSOPA. Among other things, we put neon lights outside London's theatres and cinemas. We were covered by the Joint Industrial Board's conditions of employment. We then changed the conditions of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
We went outside the JIB, which had the harmful effect of much lower pay when people were on holiday than when they were at work, which required overtime arrangements which in our circumstances were not relevant, and which required people to be at work through custom and practice to boost their earnings when they were not needed and when they would be just as well off if they received the money without having to turn up for work on Saturday mornings one weekend in two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After long negotiation and consultation, the change was accepted by the employees of the firm, and none of them subsequently regretted it. At the same time, I encouraged the managers and those who were not in trade unions to join trade unions. Some of them did so slightly against their will, but it seemed to be neat and tidy that they should. Without compulsion, this seemed to be a reasonable thing to do in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation then arose that, when our people went to work at London Airport or at television studios, they were asked whether they had union cards, and, of course, they replied that they did. They would not have been allowed to work there if they had not had union cards, even though their terms and conditions of employment were better than if they had stayed on the JIB rates. Then they were asked whether they were on the JIB, and they said that they were not. They were told that in that case they could not come in because the other people there would all stop work if they did. It took an hour and a half to explain exactly how the terms and conditions of employment which were relevant to them, which had been accepted by the district officers of the ETU and NATSOPA, were better than the rates at the television studio, and things went on all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people negotiate their own terms and conditions of employment, satisfactory to themselves and, as in that case, satisfactory to their unions as well though different from the established order of things, one can run into the sort of problem which the people I was working with had at the television studio. The hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) is shaking his head. I do not know whether he is disagreeing with me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>89</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stanley Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point which the hon. Member must answer is this. Would the body be stronger without trade union representation or with trade union representation? If he addresses his mind to that matter, he will see even from the example that he has given that it would be much better to have the trade unions committed and knowing what is going on than to have them outside where the sorts of difficulty to which he has referred could arise. His argument demonstrates to my mind the need for the clause as drafted, which the amendment he supports would change. The facts he gives go exactly contrary to the case he is seeking to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. After the television studio episode, the majority of the employees came to me and said, "Can we drop out of the union, because this is a load of rubbish? Here we are, we have negotiated pay and conditions better than we have had under the JIB and yet we are being mucked about, we are being prevented from doing our work, and the television contractors will not bring us in as much as they did before because of this aggravation. We want to come out of the union". I explained to them, possibly wrongly, that I thought that that was probably not a wise idea and that if one was setting a trend one would hope that others would copy it, and that it would help to raise productivity and earnings and all the rest. The hon. Gentleman is smiling. I hope that he agrees with what I did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A month later, we discovered that the GLC, across there in County Hall, had passed a little resolution that for electrical contractors they would employ only people working under JIB rates and conditions of employment. How crazy can one get?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now a full-time Member of Parliament, but I believe that the employees concerned will probably come back and say "We insist on coming out of the union if this sort of thing is going to happen". If they then want to set up an industrial common ownership scheme, which they were considering very keenly a year and a half ago, and they go along to the "relevant body", what happens when they are asked about the history of their firm, their trade union membership and the rest? If they explain that they had been in a union and had come out
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
because of the Labour movement outside—if one can use that term to describe the unions at the television studios and elected politicians of the Labour Party at County Hall—what then? I can foresee the relevant body being swayed by the one or more representatives of the trade unions who will say "We cannot touch this. These are not the sort of people we want to encourage into industrial common ownership".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why cannot we have one of the relevant bodies recognised by the Secretary of State established without representatives of trade unions? The case I am making is not that it is wrong to have trade union members on a recognised relevant body. A recognised relevant body may not want to include—although it probably will—representatives of trade unions among its members. But the requirement which we are asked to write in is that the membership must include one or more representatives of the trade unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The position is clear to me. I do not believe that the trade union movement would, by its nature, be in conflict with common ownership. But if trade unions did not have representation on the body, the result would be that the organised trade union movement would be aside and separate. We should be in greater danger of conflict if the trade unions were outside the organisation rather than within. This alone seems to justify the presence of the trade union representative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arguments for having a trade union representative or member stand whether or not we write the requirement into the Bill. This ought to be clear to all members of the Committee. It is certainly clear to anyone outside who is thinking about these things. It would leave it to the relevant body to make its own decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument against rights laid down in the Bill is as follows. First, it was not thought necessary when the Bill was drafted. Second, no one argued on Second Reading that this was new principle which must be brought in. Third, we are likely to get much more co-operation in furthering the idea and ideal of industrial common ownership if we leave out such partisan provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>91</span>
It appears from the new clause as it stands that the relevant body could consist only of representatives of trade unions. It does not provide that the body must consist of any other than repretatives of trade unions. It seems a curious way of drafting legislation which is supposed to appeal to many working people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my intervention has not been as brief as I intended, but it has not been as partisan as it could have been. Many of us have had experience of the deficiencies of trade unions and their democracy. One need only look at the Trades Union Congress. The 3 million Tory trade unionists are not represented there. Amid the talk of the need for representatives of trade unions to ensure democracy, one begins to think that perhaps there are as many faults in trade unions such as those of which hon. Members are members as there are in business, with which also we may be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the promoter will recognise that the Bill will have a far easier passage, with the support that it deserves, if we make this amendment to take out the obligation—not the mere possibility—to require representatives of trade unions to sit on any and every relevant body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only because the Minister has not risen, and this is, after all, his clause. How will the Secretary of State recognise a representative of a trade union? I happen to be a member of a trade union. If I were on one of these relevant bodies, together, perhaps, with my hon. Friend the Member for Woolwich, West (Mr. Bottomley), would the Minister of the day say "There are a couple of chaps who represent trade unions", or would he say "I need a certificate from the trade union head office to say that those two chaps"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bulmer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From Len Murray.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be Mr. Len Murray or it might be someone else. But it is the Minister's clause and we must know how the Minister of the day will decide who is a representative of a trade union. If he cannot tell us, either he has not thought out his Bill very well or he does not want to tell us for some reason at which we can only guess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, when people read the record of this debate, they will notice
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
how curiously misunderstood the whole argument has been. The Part of the clause which I wish to remove is the reference to representatives of trade unions. The case for keeping that in, which hon. Members on the Government side have been making, has been predominantly a case for having trade unionists on the body. Unless they have understood the difference between those two, they have understood very little of what is in our minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Industry (Mr. Les Huckfield)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the convenience of the Committee, I do not intend to take long, but I should like to reply to one or two specific points which have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) straightaway that it is the Government's intention that representatives of the trade union movement will be appointed to the body in consultation with the TUC. As far as we are concerned, the precise machinery is not all that important, but we believe that consultation with the TUC should take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to understand that that would happen whether or not these words are written into the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether the hon. Gentleman was present throughout the Second Reading debate I do not know, but my predecessor as Under-Secretary of State made clear the Government's intention to propose that representatives of the trade union movement would not only be consulted but would be appointed to the body under discussion. The Government's intentions have been made quite clear throughout. It has been very much common practice under this Government to include provision—for example, on the National Enterprise Board, the Manpower Services Commission and a number of other bodies which have been set up—for representatives of the trade union movement to be appointed. In this context we do not propose to depart from that practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are following the practice that we have already been pursuing. We made our intention amply clear on Second Reading. We intend to consult the TUC regarding the precise trade union representation on this body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister says that the Government intend to consult the TUC, does he mean that, when one comes to the stage when people go on to the relevant body which the Minister chooses to recognise, they will not merely be representatives of trade unions but they will be the agreed representatives of the trade unions—agreed, that is, between the Minister of the day and the TUC?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not only a question of the power of the TUC but of the power of the Minister, who now tells us that these people will be appointed not by the trade union movement alone but in consultation between the Government and the trade union movement, and that therefore the Minister of the day will have the power of veto and will have to some extent the advantage, if advantage it be, of suggesting names to the TUC. Is that what the Minister means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I genuinely do not wish to prolong the debate. I take it that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that there are fairly frequent, thorough-going and open channels of communication between the Government and the TUC. Certainly, I do not envisage the kind of collision or confrontation to which he has just referred. Generally, it has been our policy to consult the TUC. We are merely following that policy in the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the Minister misunderstands the point entirely. He talks about collision and things of that sort. That is not the point. If the trade union movement wants to appoint somebody, it appoints him. Why does it have to have the consultation to which the Minister referred—with him or with any other Minister of the day? Is that necessary? Can there not be someone who represents the trade union movement without having had a stamp of approval from Her Majesty's Government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Edwards</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Trades Union Congress nominated somebody who was manifestly opposed to voluntary industrial common ownership, the Government would be entitled to say "Suggest somebody else who favours this kind of development".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ments and Labour Governments over the years. What happens is this. The Government of the day get in touch with the TUC, saying that a body is being formed and that it is desired to have a trade unionist on that body. Consultations take place. That could be done in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-East (Mr. Edwards) has said that, should the TUC suggest as a member someone who was opposed to the idea of voluntary industrial common ownership—which I think most unlikely—the Government would say that that was unacceptable and would ask for another suggestion.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think that the hon. Member is raising a point of order. I am prepared to let him have a further word, but not on the basis of a point of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Jones. The Minister has just implied, as did the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins), that this body is being appointed by the Government. I am not clear where the justification for that lies. If it is a body established by those who want to help industrial common ownership, clearly, they will want to establish a body which is acceptable to the Government. Although the Government may say that on boards which they establish they require—or have required in certain circumstances—representatives of trade unions, that is no reason why they should have the right to dictate to a body which will be set up by outsiders that it must include representatives of trade unions.

I leave with the Minister the thought which we have had to repeat several times this morning. We are not saying

that representatives of trade unions or trade unionists should not be included if the people on the body think they should. If the majority take that view, obviously they will be included. The question is whether it should be required that the only statutory members, so to speak, of this voluntary body shall be representatives of trade unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading, the then Government spokesman, my hon. Friend's predecessor—my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Kelvingrove (Mr. Carmichael)—said that Clause 3 was not acceptable to the Government because it dealt with taxation and was therefore not appropriate to a Private Member's Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provisions to meet the objects of the clause are included in Clauses 47 and 78 of the Finance Bill. Clause 47 provides relief on conversions in respect of capital gains tax; and Clause 78 provides relief in respect of capital transfer tax. So those two clauses in the Finance Bill meet the general objective set out in Clause 3 of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members, who have slightly pulled my leg in previous sittings because of my membership of the Standing Committee on the Finance Bill, will</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>ownership. There is no question of the Government, through the Secretary of State, foisting upon that body certain statutory representatives of trade unions. There would be proper consultations between the body itself and the TUC, with the Government involved in the purocess. Surely, that is the way that it would operate.</p>

	<p>be interested to know that that Committee finally completed its arduous labours late last Thursday evening, and that both clauses stand part of the Bill in readiness for the forthcoming Report stage, which will give an opportunity for the matter to be raised on the Floor of the House. The main point is that the proposals of Clause 3 of this Bill are contained in the Finance Bill, and it is entirely appropriate that they should be. I would therefore recommend to the Committee that the clause do not stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I merely thank the hon. Gentleman for his explanation. We look forward to looking at those clauses at another time in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

after the Bill had been published that it would have been better if "registrar" had been defined in an earlier clause rather than in a separate clause. Although it is the deletion of a clause which is proposed by my hon. Friend, it does not amount to more than a drafting amendment, and I hope the Committee will agree that the clause do not stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the amendment is simply to omit the provision that the operation of the Bill may be delayed for six months until after Royal Assent. We do not see any complication which would need this delay. We hope—and I hope that my hon. Friends hope—that the Bill will come into operation immediately after Royal Assent. Consequently, we do not see any need for this delay, and I hope that the Committee will agree to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it rather regrettable that we are handling it in quite this matter. I do not object to removing the part which refers to provision for tax
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>98</span>
liability of certain shareholders, because clearly that has been done, and it would obviously be silly if we did not amend the Title of the Bill in that sense. But I think it regrettable that the Long Title will not continue to be
	<br><q><p>"A Bill to Further the development of enterprises owned and controlled by people working in them…"</p></q>
and so on. It is a great pity that those words could not have remained in the Long Title. I am not quite sure, even now, why they could not have remained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am by no means out of sympathy with the point which the hon. Gentleman has made, but I am advised that the wording would be superfluous, and that the ground is covered by the form of wording now proposed in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original Long Title received a considerable amount of advance thought by myself and my co-sponsors, and it was deliberately made as extensive as possible in order to give us the widest possible scope in drafting the Bill. I know from previous experience, and other hon. Members will be aware, that the Long Title strictly limits the content of a Bill, and once it has been approved by the House, it cannot be lengthened; and nothing outside the Long Title can be included in the Bill. But it can be shortened. The amendments bring the Long Title into line with the contents of the Bill as they have been amended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clemitson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to introduce a note of dissension on this side, but I am not entirely happy about leaving out the words "owned and" because the Title of the Bill is the "Industrial Common Ownership Bill", and the Bill is very much concerned with ownership as well as with control. I do not want to enter into a detailed philosophical argument about whether control is possible without ownership or whether the two go together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only argument that seems to have been advanced for deleting the words is that they are superfluous. If there were some technical reason for omitting them, I could go along with it. But I am not happy about agreeing to the deletion of these words purely on the grounds of superfluity because I cannot see that the words "owned and" are superfluous
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>99</span>
when the very Title of the Bill is "Industrial Common Ownership".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support what my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Clemitson) has said. When the Minister comes to reply, I hope that he will explain clearly whether this deletion is necessary. I feel that it undoubtedly weakens the Title of the Bill and makes it different from that which many of us thought that we were supporting. If it is essential for some reason which has been worked out by those concerned with legal matters which are not immediately apparent to those of us on the Committee, I will be prepared to accept it. But if it is possible to have the Title originally provided, if there is no particular reason other than that the words are superfluous in certain quarters for one, hope that we might consider whether the amendment is necessary at all. I shall listen carefully to what my hon. Friend the Minister says because I do not wish to object to any reasonable amendment, but I think it would be wrong of us merely to accept it because it has been suggested that otherwise the words might be superfluous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Les Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help my hon. Friends. I can share some of their difficulties because I admit that, standing back from the Bill and looking at it in perspective, it may appear that, by deleting some of these words, some of the purposes of the Bill might have been thought to have been changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to reassure my hon. Friends and the Committee absolutely that the objective of the Bill has not been changed. I also want to reassure my hon. Friends that any changes which are proposed in the Title of the Bill have all been agreed with my hon. Friend and his co-sponsors. So there is no disagreement between the Government and the sponsors of the Bill on the proposals that these two amendments seek to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am informed that these are purely technical amendments consequential upon what we have already done in the Committee, particularly that to leave in the words "owned and" implies that a common ownership enterprise must have a share capital, which would be untrue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friends will accept that we do not want to include references to share capital because we dealt with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
that in previous amendments. These amendments are purely technical and purely consequential upon things that have already been done. I want to reassure my hon. Friends that the aims, objectives and purposes of the Bill are not changed at all by leaving out these words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clemitson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to come back on this, but I want to press the point a little further. I cannot see how ownership can be held to imply share capital, when the definition of a common ownership enterprise in the Bill as amended is one not having a share capital. I cannot see that the technical argument in that matter can hold water.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister ought to take note of the fact that the hon. Member for Luton, East (Mr. Clemitson), the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) and I are all on to the same point with the same misgivings he ought to wonder whether he has somehow or other got surrounded and perhaps should surrender decently. I would not want there to be any possibility that the Bill could apply in any way to enterprises which were not owned as well as controlled by the people who work in them. That is what the thing is about. It is not the common control of businesses movement that we have been talking about but the common ownership movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment is a strange piece of pedantry which has crept in from somewhere with no particularly good reason. It sounds highly bureaucratic and officious to me. Although I would not go so far as to take the lead in seeking to oppose the amendment—I do not feel that it is a matter for me—if hon. Members opposite feel strongly enough to take the risk of ignoring the Minister's advice and sticking to what looks like common sense as opposed to official advice, I should certainly support them in doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if my hon. Friend the Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) could let us know whether he feels that it is essential for this change to take place so that the Bill can go through. If that is the position, I should not wish on a matter of this sort—I do not regard it as one of principle—to hold up the Bill. On the other hand, I cannot see the common sense of what we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
are being asked to do. In the circumstances, I should like to press on my hon. Friend the Member for Consett and the Minister the necessity of having another look at this issue. It seems to some of us that, with the best will in the world, something is being lost on this occasion which we need not lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friends will give us the assurance that it is essential, as far as they can see at present, that this change takes place, but that they will have another look at it, I shall not oppose the amendment, which does not seem to be a matter of principle. But I hope that my hon. Friends will recognise that I feel, as does my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, East (Mr. Clemitson), quite unhappy about this change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that I do not share the sentiment of the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit). Admittedly, we appear to be on common ground on this point, but when I am on common ground with the hon. Member I feel my way very cautiously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must concede that the Minister has said that the objectives of the Bill have not changed. In that case, I see no purpose in changing the wording. I am not prepared to go to the stake on this point. If to do otherwise will obstruct the passage of the Bill, I shall accept the Minister's guidance, but I should much rather have a justification and a better explanation. It is not sufficient simply to say that it is technically not feasible. I want to know why it is technically not feasible, and I should be grateful if the Minister would be prepared to look at it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Les Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be obliging to everybody this morning, because I recognise the strong feelings behind some of the points which my hon. Friends have raised. I do not intend to gloss over those feelings, because I recognise that several of my hon. Friends have had far more experience in the industrial common ownership movement and of co-operative societies than I may have had as a Minister. As the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) said, one needs to do a fair amount of reading up of company law when one comes into this job, so I bow with great deference to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
large amount of practical experience on this side of the Committee in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I want to reassure my hon. Friends. First, the aims and objectives of this piece of legislation are not changed at all by the changes which these two amendments seek to make. Secondly, the amendments are being made only in full, frank and open consultation and agreement with my hon. Friend. Thirdly, I am advised that these changes are legally necessary to enable the Bill to go through. My hon. Friends asked for that undertaking and explanation, and I am giving it to them now. We believe that technically these changes are legally necessary to enable the Bill to go forward in its present form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, because the technical and legal explanation is a little complicated, because I am not legally trained, and because I do not want to delay the Committee any further, I give an undertaking here and now that I shall write to the members of the Committee and set out in detail why these legal and technical points mean that the words have to be changed in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have given my hon. Friends the answers and the undertakings which they seek. There is nothing sinister in this. Everything is being done in the fullest co-operation with my hon. Friend and, having said that, I hope that they will now be able to accept these two amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The slightly traumatic experience of the last few minutes has impelled me to rise to my feet again briefly to say that I entirely accept what my hon. Friend the Minister has said. There has been full consultation with me as the promoter of the Bill about this. My hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) put a specific question to me. In reply, I do not feel that anything is lost from the Bill by this change in the Long Title. As the Minister has said this is a necessary technical and legal amendment, and I am grateful for my hon. Friend's assurance that he will be writing to members of the Committee to set out the reasons in detail. It is essential, in order to progress the Bill, to accept this amendment to the Long Title.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Watkins</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure, Mr. Jones, to thank you for the courteous and helpful way in which you have presided over the deliberations of the Committee.

The Committee was greatly helped in a difficult situation by your understanding and helpfulness, which has continued throughout our proceedings.

Whilst I am on my feet I should also like to express my thanks to Mr. Sweetman, the Clerk to the Committee, who has been extremely helpful in giving me advice on complicated matters of procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to thank all hon. Members on both sides of the Committee for the part which they have played in our proceedings. One of the most notable features has been that there has been a high level of attendance from the hon. Members appointed throughout the proceedings of the Committee. It has been apparent that every hon. Member has had a genuine interest in the Bill and an anxiety to ensure that it had the detailed examination which was necessary, but also nevertheless to expedite the proceedings. I express my appreciation of the courteous and helpful way in which all hon. Members have taken part in the proceedings of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tebbit</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should merely like to add my thanks to those of the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) to you, Mr. Jones, on behalf of the Committee, for your kindness and understanding, particularly in easing us out of the difficulties which we had got into on our first sitting and for keeping us firmly on the rails and getting through in only three sittings what had become quite a complex Bill. Fortunately, we were agreed upon the principle if not on the details, which no doubt made it easier for you to keep us as well in order as you did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Les Huckfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should also like to offer my thanks to you, Mr. Jones, as the Chairman who has guided us through some pretty peculiar procedural techniques—I say that in the true sense of the word. It is not often that we have to decide whether we can debate amendments before we can debate new clauses and then find out afterwards that we have to debate new clauses first. Many of us, if we have not learned all that much about the industrial common ownership movement have certainly learned a fair amount about the procedural techniques of getting a private Member's Bill through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In thanking you, Mr. Jones, for the wisdom and guidance that you have bestowed upon the Committee, I not only want to thank my hon. Friends and hon. Members opposite for the co-operation and enthusiasm they have shown to get this Bill through the Committee, but to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins). It is the second time that he has piloted a private Member's Bill through this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a monumental task to undertake when one starts from scratch, having found that someone has a good idea which one wants to translate into legislation. There are the consultations with the interests involved and consultations with the parliamentary draftsman and with the various Bill offices of the House of Commons. Then there is the trauma of trying to get it through and having to make certain changes on the way, especially when one realises that certain provisions which one would like to make should not be in the Bill but in another piece of legislation. I congratulate my hon. Friend for his perspicacity and tenacity. He has done it well, and I hope that the Bill will now complete its remaining stages very quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also want to say a word of congratulation and encouragement to many of my hon. Friends who have devoted a political career and a political lifetime in many cases to the co-operative movement in various ways. Although this may be a small piece of legislation, in terms of what it does and what it can do it is a very great step forward along the road which many of my colleagues had been treading long before I came into the House. I hope that this will be a great
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
step forward in their endeavours along the road they have been treading for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am glad that we have made quick progress and I hope that we shall make just as speedy progress on 16th July; that is when I hope we shall have further discussions on the Bill. Although the various reminiscences on selection conferences were becoming interesting, and I was looking forward to other contributions from both sides of the Committee on that topic, I think you were quite right, Mr. Jones, to say on that occasions like this it is advantageous that the technicalities of the Bill should have precedence over the technicalities of selection conferences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we can now report this Bill to the House, and that we can make

the speediest possible progress to Royal Assent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the kind thanks which have been expressed to the Chair.
