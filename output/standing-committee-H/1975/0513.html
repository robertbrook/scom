	<br><blockquote><p>"or where appropriate redundancy payments".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hayman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief—but not as brief as I was on Tuesday—because I think that the correct place for us to debate at some length the position of the staff involved is on Clauses 12 and 13. At this stage I want to make a couple of points that have been put to me, particularly by the staff of the New Towns Commission, and to question the Minister about what is happening at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Commission staff, more than the development corporation staff, are concerned for two reasons about how they will be affected by the transfer. They are likely to be affected sooner. They envisage that soon after 1st April 1977 the transfer of assets will take place and that their rôles will be in question. They believe that vulnerability will arise at a time when the Staff Commission will not have been established for any length of time to be able to safeguard their interests properly. They are particularly worried about their position between now and 1st April 1977.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
They also have slight doubts over the future rôle that the staff Commission will play. We know that the Government envisage a rôle for the commission, and we know that the transfer of assets is not to be complete, but many of the staff are not wholly employed on housing or in the industrial and commercial departments. Some, for instance, work in accounting departments and deal with all aspects. They are particularly worried that their interests should be safeguarded as far as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who have argued that having two housing authorities is inefficient, that it means two sets of people doing the same work, would be foolish to argue at the same time that there should be no redundancies when the transfer of assets takes place, but if redundancies are to occur, if there is duplication involved, then obviously the staff of the development corporations and New Towns Commission, many of whom have given all their working lives to the interests of the towns and authorities they have served, should be safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister give the Committee any information about what is being done by the Staff Advisory Committee which is functioning now? Can he say anything about the recruitment to local authority housing departments between now and April 1977?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The staff of the New Towns Commission feel strongly that arrangements should be made so that any vacancies are not filled by people from outside and that vacancies should be made available, in the first instance, to the staff of the New Towns Commission before they are advertised nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we shall have an opportunity to debate these matters in more detail, I shall finish my remarks there, and I shall be grateful if the Minister could answer some of our questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Guy Barnett)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two hon. Members have taken part in this short debate—the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) and my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn and Hatfield (Mrs. Hayman) who made brief speeches. I well understand the reasons behind the debate. They were articulately argued by my hon. Friend. She said that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0477">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
we shall probably have a fairly full debate on this subject when we consider Clause 12, but it is incumbent on me to try to answer some of the questions that have been asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch spent some time giving the Committee a preview of other aspects of staff protection which he might want to raise when the Committee reaches Clauses 12 and 13. He began in a statesmanlike way drawing our attention to the criticisms which have been made about some aspects of major reorganisations in the public sector and implied that we should avoid making the same mistakes. He then indicated his awareness of some of the problems which are relevant in the context of the transfer of housing assets in new towns to district councils. He mentioned the absence of provisions for early retirement in lieu of compensation, recruitment procedures, and the powers of the Staff Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to deal here with all aspects of staff protection. We are concerned here with that part of a transfer scheme which the parties to the scheme are asked to provide because we regard it as important that the Secretary of State should, when finally deciding whether these significant Exchequer-financed assets should be transferred, be satisfied that the staffing arrangements for the ownership and management of those assets are adequate and that the position of individual members of staff has been properly considered, having regard to the regulations which will flow from the regulation-making powers in Clause 12. There will be many facets of staff protection which will require attention by the parties concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The qualification proposed by Amendment No. 32 and the singling out of redundancy payments as though they were not part of arrangements for the protection of staff by Amendment No. 33 seem to us to be quite unnecessary and they could be misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must emphasise that protection of existing staff extends, broadly speaking, to two types of situation. First, protection is afforded to those employees who, as a result of a scheme, are given new employment either with the same employer or with the other party to the scheme. Regulations are to be made to ensure that their
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
remuneration and other terms and conditions of employment are not less favourable than before transfer, so long as they are employed on reasonably comparable duties. If their duties are not so comparable, the terms and conditions of employment, except for remuneration, are to be not less favourable than before. Secondly, those employees who, as a result of a transfer scheme, suffer loss of employment or loss or diminution of emoluments are to be protected through regulations to be made under Section 24 of the Superannuation Act 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Second Reading debate my right hon. Friend said: "I know that we can rely on the good sense of the parties, particularly local authorities as the main new employer, to see that the interests of staff whose jobs are affected are handled sympathetically and that recruitment policies are followed which minimise individual cases of potential hardship." (	<i>Official Report,</i> 23rd March; Vol. 908, c. 221.)
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our earlier discussions we have described our view of what the local democratic process should be and we have drawn attention to statements by the Opposition to the effect that, in creating our present system of local government, the virtue of giving local authorities more control over their own affairs should be recognised. We must beware, therefore, of trying to dot all the i's and cross all the t's in a situation which, for reasons of management and organisation structures and existing staffing levels, will vary in some degree from place to place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not want it to be implied, even by the subsection as drafted at present, that all staff affected by proposals for transfer will necessarily be retained in employment after transfer. If that were to be the case we would not be rightly concerned with compensation provisions, including redundancy payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the parties to the transfer schemes to approach the problems which will arise with the utmost care for the interests of the individual, but we cannot expect responsible local authorities to try to achieve full and fair protection by a deliberate policy of overmanning or unnecessary upgrading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested in our consultations on the Bill that the inclusion of subsection (5)(	<i>d</i>) demonstrates some lack of faith in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
the good sense of the parties, particularly of district councils, but, having decided that it is important that the Secretary of State should be aware how the parties are solving the important problems of staffing to ensure that the transferred assets are properly looked after, I think it would be wrong to introduce an element of doubt on the face of the Bill by the insertion by the amendment of the words "so far as is possible" at the end of line 15 in page 5. A small working group of officials is examining the form and content of transfer schemes and I have every confidence that, with such advice as the New Towns Staff Advisory Committee might care to give them, we will arrive at a satisfactory description of what should be included in a transfer scheme to satisfy the wording now in subsection (5)(	<i>d</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all that I can say at the moment, but the new Staff Commission has not been in existence long and cannot be fully operational till the Act is passed. I appreciate the anxieties that have been expressed to my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn and Hatfield by staff of the New Towns Commission, but it is difficult at the moment to say more than I have said. Many of the issues that she raised would probably be better dealt with on a normal trade union basis, rather than discussed in Committee. Such problems concern not only the staff of the commission but the staff of the new towns corporations, who may be affected later by transfers. There has to be a degree of flexibility to fit different situations and times. It is probably as much a trade union matter as anything else, and it would be difficult for me to make definitive remarks without prejudicing the good advice that we hope to receive from the New Towns Staff Commission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This subject will arise again on Clause 12. Its importance is recognised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I am partially satisfied by the Minister's reply, but I hope that there will not be any complacency. The Department of the Environment frequently likes to invoke the magic words "flexibility" when it does not want to commit itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this area it seems to be quite essential that we do not have what we recognised happened with local government re-organisation, when too many jobs were
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
upgraded, preserved or created, and the thing got out of hand. I have been talking recently to people concerned in the new towns movement. One of the points they make is that when one goes to work in a new town development corporation one accepts that one is going to work in something different from other local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are great virtues in local government, but the new town pattern that we have adopted in post-war years has a style of management intended to be dynamic and to be able to get on with the job. This has attracted to it many people who would find the routine of local government life a bit unsatisfactory, people who are prepared to take a chance because they feel that in return they are making a more immediate impact on their environment. A lot of these people are not the sort who think in terms of a lifelong career, but of doing a good job in a particular place, recognising that, after they have done that good job in a particular place, they can move on and go somewhere else. It has been the intention and practice with the new town corporations that there has been this different attitude. One does not go into new town work looking for a secure and lifelong career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that this spirit should be recognised. It would be sad if people who worked hard and effectively on that sort of basis somehow or other were over-cosseted. There are many jobs where someone does not have lifelong security, protection and so on. If one spread the general view that everyone would never have to worry about the future one would contribute to the gradual demoralisation of the country. One wants to be reasonable about this. People have given good service and one wants to make sure that their interests are looked after, but I am talking about a frame of mind. This point has been made by new town staff who are themselves the people who will be affected: this is not a case of an outsider coming in and telling people what they ought to feel: it is something that they feel themselves. We cannot expect that every single person should necessarily be guaranteed the right to preserve his job if the reason for that job no longer exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also expect, and the Minister has hinted at this, that the new employers, the local authorities, should be fair and go for talent. They should not say "These are our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
lads and we should look after them". It is vital that local government should be committed to the notion that the best men should get the jobs, and I hope the Government will make that point strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter to which we shall return on Clause 12 and we do not propose to press our amendments at this stage. It is something in which we shall take a running interest during the passage of this Bill. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Member cannot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Bonner Pink, for protecting the rights of Back Benchers. I was slightly surprised that, having moved the amendment, I should find it being withdrawn without my having the opportunity of saying anything on what the Minister has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Minister was reading from his brief. I find it difficult to accept the idea that we can safely leave the matters which I raised—and I said that I raised them as markers—to a sort of trade union bargaining. This is what my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) was suggesting we were afraid of, because the trade union bargaining which took place at the time of local government reorganisation—and we were partly responsible at the time—took staffing way out of any field of democratic control and reality from the point of view of the ratepayers. It is that sort of attitude we are trying to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave no answer to some of the questions I was asking about redundancies. I mentioned the example of finance staff in new town corporations and the welfare staff for whom there is no parallel in the local authorities. I wondered whether the Minister had hoisted that point on board. Having laid those markers I give notice that we intend to return to the subject. I am grateful to the Minister for his efforts to hoist on board what I was trying to say. From his remarks this morning we have the feeling that he understands the issues and is reaching towards some solution of them. I do not think he has entirely convinced us that the position is safeguarded from either the point of view of the staff or that of the ratepayers, and we shall have to come back to this on
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
Clause 12 and press him a little further. The Minister did not reply on what was happening about recruitment. I was trying to persuade him to tell local authorities not to recruit in advance of this merging of staff. I was asking what had happened, but the Minister was not able to provide us with information. We shall be coming back to that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those remarks, and according to the wish of my hon. Friends, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am of the opinion that the principle of the clause and any matters arising thereon have been adequately discussed in the course of debate on the amendments proposed thereto, and I will, therefore, put the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question,</i> that the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill, 	<i>put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 4</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PROCEDURE FOR MAKING TRANSFER SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stanley Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 83, in page 5, line 33, after "directions", insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and if, after consultations with the county councils and district councils adjacent to the district council making the transfer scheme, he is satisfied that the scheme would be compatible with the proper development of the new town".</p></blockquote>
The object of this amendment is to ensure that the district council to which land, housing accommodation, other assets and rights are being transferred under the provisions of this. Bill will be in a position to carry out all such works as may be necessary and desirable for the proper development of those assets and of the town as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must confess that I have encountered some difficulty in drafting an amendment which would facilitate this, because it is not possible to transfer from the development corporation or the commission to district councils powers which those development corporations and the commission do not already possess. However, I must point out in this connection that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
there is a division of responsibility between district and county authorities and as a result in some cases in the past, there have been difficulties or delays, which have arisen as a result of the problems of obtaining the approval of county authorities for works essential for developments to go ahead. I am not particularly complaining about the relationship of Harlow with Essex County Council, I must say in case there should be any misunderstanding on this, but I am referring to the situation generally up and down the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kind of development I am thinking of is one, for example, in which a road requires county council approval before a local development can be proceeded with satisfactorily. A development corporation or the commission, in so far as they are direct Government agencies, have somewhat more weight and better connections for securing the objective of persuading a county council to approve a development than has a district council. It is essential, after transfer takes place, that a district council in a new town should not by a disagreement with a county authority over such essential works, be delayed unreasonably, or even be prevented, from proceeding with essential development. Similar problems can arise between new town authorities and neighbouring district councils. It is possible that works may overlap or even be situated within a neighbouring authority's district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to ensure that the district authority responsible for the proper development of any area which is part of a new town should have the power to carry out those works without being blocked by a neighbouring authority. Sometimes, neighbouring authorities have been known not to look upon developments proposed by the district council's neighbouring new town with the greatest possible enthusiasm. In these circumstances it would be wrong that we should permit this Bill to be approved without taking this matter into account. New town district council boundaries are frequently tightly drawn, and in these circumstances it is not inconceivable, for example, that a road which is essential to the development of a new town runs in part through a neighbouring district council's area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
The Minister should give consideration to this problem. When a transfer takes place he should do everything possible to ensure that a district council to which the assets are being transferred will not in any way be inhibited as a result of a disagreement or difficulties arising with other authorities, the county councils or neighbouring district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment is an effort to see that this point can be covered. I assure my hon. Friend that it is not something frivolous, but about something which I know from experience has arisen in the past. All of us could agree that it is necessary that essential developments should not be held up or prevented as a result of differences arising between different authorities. I am, therefore, moving this amendment in the hope that it will cover the point that I am seeking to make and will strengthen this Bill in this respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) for moving this amendment. It follows what we have been trying to say throughout these proceedings, that there is a need to have effective consultation with county councils and adjoining district councils. It is by no means theoretical or frivolous, and the hon. Member has done well to raise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my case we have a sewage farm and road problems on an adjoining district council's land. One problem has been that there has still been no satisfactory conclusion between the county council, the Department and the new town corporation for new formulae to be adopted for the construction of a major road. I give as example the Bromsgrove highway in Redditch. Instead of, as it were, falling between two stools, as before, it is now falling between three, with disastrous results for the wretched people living along the inadequate roads carrying a greatly increased volume of traffic for which they are by no means designed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious problem, to which we have been alluding throughout the Committee, and there is a need for some provision. I share the doubt expressed by the hon. Member for Harlow about whether this is necessarily the best place or the best means of making that provision, but the problem is there, and we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
join in hoping for a concrete response to a real situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) was moving this amendment because he might have certain issues arising from his own experience about which he is concerned. I should briefly explain to the Committee why, inevitably, I have to resist the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Its effect would be to require the Secretary of State to consult the county council and any district council adjacent to the "main" district council that is a party to the transfer scheme, whether or not this adjacent district council has any part of the new town or any of the dwellings of the new town within its district, as to whether it is appropriate to proceed with a transfer scheme. This would be unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause deals with the procedure for making and approving transfer schemes. Consultations leading to the preparation of a scheme are dealt with in earlier clauses. As a result of the Committee's discussion of previous amendments to Clauses 1 and 3, we have already promised to consider further the case for incorporating at a suitable point in the Bill a requirement for consultation with county councils and with councils of any adjoining district that have a "minor" interest in a transfer scheme because a small portion of the new town's housing extends into its area. I repeat our assurance that we are looking at this, and looking at what would be the appropriate point for incorporating any such requirements. This clause, however, is certainly too late a point in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat my assurance that we are looking at this to see what can be done, but obviously it will be impossible for me to say anything about that at this stage. We cannot accept a need for consultations with any adjacent district council whether or not it has any part of the new town or any dwellings of the new town within its district. We are, as I have stressed, looking at the case for requiring consultations with the district council with a "minor" interest in the transfer. There is no case for requiring consultations with any district council which happens to be adjacent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the amendment would require the Secretary of State to be satisfied at the stage of submission of the scheme to him
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
that it is compatible with the proper development of the new town. Again, this is too late a stage in the transfer procedure for such a requirement. Clause 2 sets out the conditions which must be fulfilled before the Secretary of State may give directions for consultations with a view to making a transfer scheme. That is the right stage for the Secretary of State to be satisfied whether transfer is likely to be compatible with the completion of the development of the new town—not after the parties concerned have held detailed consultations under Clause 2, after the Secretary of State has issued formal directions for the preparation of a transfer scheme under Clause 3, and after the scheme has been prepared by the parties and submitted to the Secretary of State under Clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say something general about the comments by my hon. Friend and the anxieties which have again been expressed by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) because we have now debated this kind of issue twice. I should begin by making a general point about the relationship between county councils and district councils in respect of this Bill. Of course there have been examples of conflict in all parts of the country, not just where a new town happens to be situated in the area of a county council and a district council. It is not my business to comment on that, but inevitably councils will find themselves occasionally in conflict. One hopes that they will resolve that conflict, particularly where it involves the exercise of specific powers which they may have, whether for highways or for housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be wrong would be to put the district council—which seems to be the desire of my hon. Friend if I understand him correctly—which happens to be in a new town in a situation different from that in which any other district council finds itself. I ask myself why he should wish to do this and why he should think there is something special about a district council in a new town area. Obviously, he, being an hon. Member representing a new town, is aware of a district—I do not use the word in a local government sense—where development has been going on, but I remind him and the Committee that we are talking about the transfer of assets to democratically elected district councils because those assets largely represent completed pieces of development. Under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>193</span>
this Bill we are, in effect, making it possible for transfer schemes to be drawn up so that areas which have been developed by new town corporations will become fully-fledged district council areas in their own right, and on almost precisely the same basis, if not precisely the same basis, as that of any other district council area not associated with a new town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly and obviously I sympathise with the kind of situation which my hon. Friend has met. There may be more in new town areas than elsewhere. Perhaps my hon. Friend is criticising the Local Government Act, but that is not a matter for our debate this morning. All one can hope for, now that the Government have given a definite commitment that we shall consider writing in a requirement for consultation with the county council, and that we have already agreed, where a district council is definitely involved in a scheme in the sense that a small part of a housing estate happens to be within its area, we try to include the necessary consultation procedure, is that good sense will prevail, and that where councils find themselves in disagreement or conflict they will behave sensibly and reasonably to find a solution acceptable to both sides. I am sorry to disappoint my hon. Friend but I do not think he expected me to accept the amendment, which I advise the Committee to reject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not just a question of transfer of a completed housing estate or two. Because of the chicken and egg problem, in some cases housing development has come before the necessary roads or sewerage, and in others it is the other way round. So that if the Under-Secretary imagines there will be a transfer of a neat package of housing with the associated works completed, he has not grasped the problem. I can give him a specific example in addition to that about roads. This is a matter of sewerage. It is generally thought to be necessary to rebuild the old sewerage works on the west side of Redditch. The Minister should not imagine that it is only a neat package to be transferred. Life is not like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I accept that. The Government would not have written in the provision for management schemes if they had not been aware of the problems the hon. Gentleman has described, but let him not run away with the idea that new housing estates are not built in other parts
	<span class='label label-info column'>194</span>
or that a county council does not have to be brought in so that sewerage, roads and other services are provided. We are not, on this issue of housing estates, entering a new and unprecedented situation, but a situation which county councils have been dealing with in respect of district council development schemes, not necessarily under new town corporations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the amendment may be unacceptable as drafted and that it might do something which even I would object to, but in certain respects I would not wish to have the whole process of transfer delayed until every "t" has been crossed and every "i" dotted with every neighbouring county and district council. The hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller) recognised the problems arising from my amendment. The Minister also sees my point. I do not wish to put in a district council in a new town in a privileged position compared with that of other district councils, as was suggested I might, but I do wish to consider certain difficulties which may press more heavily on new town authorities because of their peculiar problems, namely, their concern with development, perhaps more than that of an authority whose area is largely rural. Also they might have boundaries drawn much more tightly than a neighbouring district council's. In those circumstances they are more vulnerable because more of their works may overlap, or be situated in neighbouring areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right. I am not enthusiastic about the results of local government reform, but I do not wish to raise my objections on this occasion. However, we are faced with a situation in which certain responsibilities are in the hands of authorities other than a district council of a new town which may have to seek co-operation in carrying out the development essential to the new town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not very happy about the thought that we can always rely on a co-operative spirit prevailing in neighbouring authorities in all cases. Frequently there are divisions of opinion on the issue of principle of new town development. Neighbouring authorities frequently look upon the new town development as encroaching upon the rural character of the areas over which they have power. They might be concerned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>195</span>
therefore, to resist any such developments in principle, without considering all the problems which a new town authority is seeking to meet. I believe that as the Bill is at present drafted a problem could arise on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that in the past a development corporation or the commission was able to seek help from the Minister and had a direct connection through to him. This probably will not prevail in the case of a district council. In these circumstances, is there anything else which can be done to ensure that, if difficulties do arise when a transfer takes place, they will be resolved? Would the Minister give an undertaking to see that this is done, as far as it is within his power to do so? It would be wrong if, immediately the transfer takes place from the corporation or commission to a district authority, that authority should be inhibited in carrying out certain works, and, as a result, at a later stage the population of the new town regarded the transfer as undesirable. Would the Minister tell us what can be done to ease the problems which do exist?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would not be appropriate for me to try to give a full answer now on these points. I recognise that there will be problems. No one questions that, but I do not think my hon. Friend knows, or I know, the precise shape or form that these difficulties will necessarily take. Certainly they could involve a difference or disagreement, in so far as each tier of local government can find itself in conflict from time to time. However, I promise to read carefully all that has been said in this debate. If my hon. Friend has any examples of the sort of problems which should be looked at, then certainly we shall look at them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I re-emphasise what I said before, that in general the transfer schemes for which this Bill provides are schemes of complete pieces of development, although this does not apply to those examples of management schemes. As far as the full transfer of assets to a district council is concerned, the Government are thinking in terms of transfers of complete schemes. I think, perhaps, my hon. Friend sees more bogeys than may, in fact, exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are entering a new phase. We all know about the disagreements of the past which affected the designation of new
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
towns. That phase has been gone through, the new towns have been completed and now have their own elected democratic councils. It is right that these councils should accept the responsibilities that will be placed upon them as a result of the Bill. I think the sort of problems my hon. Friend is talking about are far fewer than they might have been in the middle of the large-scale pieces of development in which new town development corporations were involved 10 or 15 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of my hon. Friend's promise to consider what has been said I have no wish to press the amendment. He is right. I do not know the precise form or shape that problems or difficulties will assume, but I do believe such problems could arise. Perhaps I am being pessimistic. I hope that these difficulties will be resolved much more easily than could be the case. It would be wrong, however, not to point out in this debate that there is an issue here which should be considered by the Committee. However, in view of what my hon. Friend has just said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a small point which we talked about in the first debate in this Committee. I am still not clear about the first line of the clause which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A new town corporation and any district council to whom directions have been given under section 3 above to make a transfer scheme…"</p></blockquote>
The question I want to raise relates to that. Is it really envisaged that these schemes. will normally be between the corporation and the major district, or is it the case that any district which has a slice of the new town and of the assets being transferred will be a party to that scheme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases this will not arise, as there will be only one district council involved, but there could be some cases. The hon. Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) raised the matter earlier of the Preston District Council which has a very small slice of a new town housing section. In such cases is it envisaged that a scheme will be between the corporation and the major district council, or will it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
include any district council which has a slice of a new town, or will the truth lie somewhere between these two?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I deal with this point there is one other matter with which I shall deal. It arises from an impression I may have given wrongly earlier in our proceedings. This clause makes provision for the very exceptional possibility of the Secretary of State imposing a scheme. I emphasise the words "very exceptional". Perhaps I made remarks, at a previous sitting, which suggested that there would never be such an occasion. There is provision for the possibility of the imposition of a scheme, but one does not need great imagination to realise the difficulties involved in imposition. It is most unlikely that it would happen, and one could see difficulties which would arise as a result of it, but, nevertheless, I should correct what may have been a wrong impression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the specific point which the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) raised, it would be correct to say that normally a transfer scheme will be between the new town corporation and the major district. We have, on previous amendments, discussed small pockets which spill over into another district, but the kind of transfer we envisage taking place will invariably involve the major district. One cannot generalise absolutely, and a situation might exist where a transfer scheme involved a piece of land where the boundary ran right down the middle. In such a case two district councils would be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments are being proposed because of difficulties
	<span class='label label-info column'>198</span>
which have become clear to us as a consequence of departmental consultations held with the new towns and local authority associations after the Second Reading of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As at present drafted subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) provides for land, and rights, liabilities and obligations relating to land, which are transferred by a transfer scheme, to vest in the district council concerned on 1st April after the date when the scheme is approved, or, as the case may be, made by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The affect of Amendment No. 55 is to make the vesting date the 1st April in any year which is specified in the scheme. Amendment No. 56 is consequential upon the adoption of that formula.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be certain administrative arrangements to be completed between the approval of a scheme and its coming into force. Therefore, it could be inconvenient to have the properties vested in the district council concerned from 1st April following the approval of the scheme if that scheme were approved or made by the Secretary of State, only a very short time before 1st April. The problem arises only in respect of land; property other than real property can be transferred on a different date by virtue of the provisions of subsection (1)(	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the Secretary of State could, of course, overcome any such difficulty by deferring his approval of the scheme till after 1st April if he could not approve it sufficiently far in advance of 1st April. However, this would prolong the period of uncertainty for the authorities concerned and their staff and it is preferable to amend the provisions of subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) in such a manner as will enable the Secretary of State to approve or make a transfer scheme as soon as possible, but permit some flexibility in respect of the operative dates of the scheme so far as it relates to the transfer of land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 35, in page 7, leave out lines 40 to 43.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the amendment primarily to find out a little more about what is meant by the words which we propose to delete. I wonder, in particular, why it is that in line 40 we have the word "land" but not the word "houses", whereas in lines 42 and 43 the "disposal of houses" is mentioned as one of the ingredients in Sections 104 and 105, to which the subsection refers. In other words, I am asking the Minister why line 40 mentions "land" only when line 42 mentions "houses" as well. This seems to be rather puzzling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at Sections 104 and 105 of the Housing Act 1957 one sees that Section 104 is simply about housing. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a local authority have acquired or appropriated any land for the purposes of this Part of this Act, then, without prejudice to any of their other powers under this Act, the local authority may, with the consent of the Minister, sell or lease any houses on the land or erected by them on the land, subject to such covenants and conditions as they may think fit…"</p></blockquote>
Section 105 of the Act relates more specifically to land. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a local authority have acquired or appropriated any land for the purposes of this Part of this Act, then, without prejudice to any of their other powers under this Act, the local authority may, with the consent of the Minister—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) sell or lease the land or part thereof to any person…"</p></blockquote>
I do not quite understand why Section 104 of the 1957 Act is relevant. Perhaps
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
the Minister can enlighten us on this point. Secondly, and this is perhaps a more important point, why should a council not have the power to dispose of land at all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see any overwhelmingly strong reason why the Government propose to take away the powers conferred in Sections 104 and 105 of that Act, and I would be grateful if the Minister could explain why this is necessary. It seems to me, if one is talking about giving local authorities freedom, that this is one particular freedom—the freedom to dispose of land. I would like to know why the Minister is trying to stop them from having it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The brief answer to the hon. Gentleman is that if he reads the relevant part of the subsection he will see that we are talking about management arrangements. The situation will be that the land is, and remains, in the ownership of a new town corporation. It would clearly not be appropriate for the district council to be able to dispose of land of which it is not the owner, but of which it is the manager. The effect of the amendment would be to enable the district council to dispose of land which it does not own, but which is owned by the new town corporation. That explains the situation, and I hope it adequately covers the point the hon. Gentleman has made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Raison</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess there seems to be a certain logic behind what the Minister has said. I am not sure I am prepared to dispute it. He has left me still puzzled as to the relevance of Section 104 which very much relates to housing. However, I will not press him on this because he may find it as confusing as I do and I do not want to embarrass him. I accept the argument he has made and do not propose to press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just answer one particular point—a legal point?

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 37, in page 8, line 36, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11). As soon as reasonably practicable after being notified that a transfer scheme has been approved or made by the Secretary of State, the corporation and council concerned shall advertise in not less than two local papers outline details of the transfer scheme".</p></blockquote>
This is a straightforward and simple amendment designed to ensure that, whereas the scheme may be deposited with the maps, etc., at council and corporation offices for inspection, there should be some provision to draw the attention of the public, particularly those concerned, to the fact that the documents are available for inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think I need elaborate on this point at any great length. However, what happens to some occupiers of affected buildings who have views about the scheme? What avenues are open to them to press such views? We have heard a great deal about the need for democratically elected control and responsibility. It is quite conceivable that some people will have views and may wish to pursue them. Therefore, they would wish to know what channels are open to them for this purpose. The possibility of views being expressed will be enhanced if there are severe financial complications or burdens arising out of the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial consequences of the scheme should also be set out in the papers which are available for inspection, so that people may be properly informed, not only of the ambit of the scheme, but also of the consequences, and of the rights which they have to make representations thereon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the issue is self-evident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised important points which are strictly outside his amendment but, with permission, I will deal with the specific
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
point he has raised which is the degree to which the public authorities concerned—the Secretary of State, the new town corporation and the district council—will be obliged to advertise the scheme which has been drawn up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be as sympathetic as I can to the amendment, and to emphasise, at the outset, that the ordinary person occupying a building affected by a transfer scheme will be very much kept in the picture about what is going on. There will obviously be notifications to occupiers and also, under Clause 10 (1) there is a provision whereby a new town corporation is required as soon as practicable after it has been given directions to prepare a transfer scheme, to inform the occupiers of any property which may be affected of the possibility of such a scheme being made and of the likely implications for them of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman very fairly raised the question whether this ought to be more widely advertised, in order to make doubly certain that the occupiers of houses directly affected would be informed, and also, presumably, because it may be of interest to other people living in the area. As the hon. Gentleman probably knows, there are precedents in other legislation for advertising in newspapers, as he proposes in his amendment. It is because there have been other precedents, and also because one wants as much publicity as one can get on a transfer scheme, that I am prepared to look sympathetically at the amendment, although not in the precise terms in which it has been moved, because there may not be two newspapers and one cannot pass a law about two papers when there is only one. We could not insist on the foundation of a new newspaper in order that the law should be obeyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, the amendment contains the words "outline details". They are slightly contradictory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I take the point. I think it is one which will need to be looked at, not in the sense that the details of the scheme could be outlined in an advertisement, but rather that, as the scheme will be on public deposit, this fact should be drawn to the attention of people living in a new town area and who may be interested in the effect of the scheme so that they can go to inspect the details of the scheme if they so wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
That is the degree to which we are prepared to try to meet the hon. Gentleman in order to ensure that the scheme is properly known. I agree that it is important that the individual occupier should be clearly told of the likely implications for him of the scheme which has been drawn up. The hon. Gentleman said that people may wish to object, and make certain points about the scheme. The hon. Gentleman correctly asks how they should do that. We have democratic processes, and if one feels that the Secretary of State or the new town corporation may not be behaving in a way to one's liking there are avenues whereby one can make objections known. However, a person will not be able to do this effectively and efficiently unless he is fully informed about the details of the scheme. Hence, the importance of the hon. Gentleman's amendment. We cannot accept it as it stands, but we will be glad to consider it to see whether some provision may be made to meet the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There has been discussion on this issue, and it is not unreasonable of me to refer again to the valuable Stevenage Working Party Report which said that it was difficult to suggest any hard and fast rule about the period for nomination rights although it recognised that they would have to run for as long as there might be a development corporation, and that it was impossible to turn off the tap immediately after transfer in the existing commission towns. The Report saw the objective as being to arrive at normality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Five years seemed to the Government to be a reasonable length of time in which to grant nomination rights to the new town corporations. One cannot go much further than that if the intention of the legislation is to achieve a normalised position whereby a district council becomes fully responsible for its own affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no doubt that a district council would want to provide for the categories of people about whom hon. Members are concerned. I cannot
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
imagine a situation in which a district council would cut its own economic throat by being totally obstructive to industrialists whose businesses were being severely affected by their inability to recruit certain kinds of skilled labour. Ultimately, it will be in the interests of the inhabitants of an area that the district council behaves sensibly, and I have enough faith in democracy to believe it will do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under paragraph (	<i>a</i>) a development corporation which transfers assets to a district council exercises such a right from the time of implementation of the transfer scheme till the corporation is wound up and its assets transferred to the Commission for the New Towns under Schedule 10 to the New Towns Act 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under paragraph (	<i>b</i>), when there has been a transfer of assets from the development corporation to a district council and the corporation is subsequently wound up and its assets transferred to the Commission for the New Towns, the latter body is able to exercise the nomination right for a further period of five years from the date of winding up of the development corporation.

	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
The clause deals with the decision of the Secretary of State to reject a scheme. The Secretary of State will consider the matter in depth and will come to certain conclusions about why he has made that decision. When dealing with local and national Government it is right that those reasons should be published, so that all the parties concerned know why a scheme has been rejected. The Bill provides for a review after three years, but if someone is to review a decision he must know why it was made in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) has explained the purpose of the amendment, but in practice I think that the Secretary of State will always give the reasons for his decision when notifying those concerned that he would not require them to prepare a scheme. However, I think that there is a case, to avoid doubt, for putting some requirement of the kind suggested on the face of the Bill. That would be in line with the general tendency of the law today. In the case of decisions given by the Secretary of State arising out of a public inquiry, for example a planning appeal, the relevant Act specifically requires the reasons for the decision be stated. We accept the principle behind the amendment, and the hon. Gentleman will be flattered to learn that we also accept the wording that he has proposed. I therefore accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. Again, it concerns a situation where there has been a rejection, and the time that should lapse before a reapplication can be made. I can see that the Department would not want to go through all the work again too soon after a decision, but why was a period of three years picked? Is there any special reason? I raise the matter not least because there will be a time when a district council may change hands politically. The new members of a district council may wish to have another look at the issue. Is there a legal reason for three years being chosen? We all want to see the transfer happen but are there technical reasons for the chosen

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why the period could not be less than three years. He already understands that one would not want repeat applications, not merely because of the work involved but because it would undoubtedly have the effect of increasing the feeling of uncertainty for new town corporation staff and it might also distract corporations from the essential task of developing the new town. That, then, is the general reason why we have adopted the principle of three years. It seemed to be the most satisfactory period. There is a degree of arbitrariness. It is not unreasonable to say that it specifically limits the length of time between the refusal of a scheme and a new application coming from a district council or new town corporation. That is all it is. It does not have the effect of preventing the consideration of a new scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause and Clause 9 are the financial clauses, and they are very important to the district councils. All of us who are members of constituencies with new towns have had experiences of where, in our considered judgment, the agreements between the local authorities and the new towns have not gone entirely smoothly. In relation to the wonderful phrase that is used in the agreement of "no undue financial burden" the interpretation by the local authorities is that that means no burden at all, and the interpretation of the Treasury is "We shall get away with as much as possible till they yell more and more and more and gradually give them a little bit more each time they yell till we come to some compromise." That is the background to this amendment and others to Clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern among members of district councils that they are going to be shortchanged by the Treasury. Therefore, their feelings, and my own feelings, and I think those of my hon. Friend, are that there must be no loopholes in the financial arrangements. If Government believe it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
right that assets should be transferred to local authorities, and Government have funded those assets in the first place and set up the financial arrangements, Government should ensure that the local people do not have to pay one single penny of extra cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with the situation where management arrangements are coming into force in a mid-year period. Unless I have read the subsection wrongly, it suggests that, if this management arrangement takes place after the beginning of the financial year, the Secretary of State may, in the following financial year, increase the basic element. It does not seem to me that there should be any allowance for him to have this option. If there is a change, there should be no option for him but to increase the basic element in the year that follows. It is as simple as that, and it is based on the unhappy experience, certainly in Northampton, where we were—and I think I am speaking for both sides—somewhat misled by the Treasury. As I understand it, there have been other arguments between development and new town corporations and the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hal Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I myself may not, I think, have done justice to this clause by the extent of our amendments to it. The point which has been raised is most important and goes a long way to explain the concern I have expressed in this Committee about the need for tenants, not only of the corporations but of the councils, to be informed of the likely effects of transfer schemes upon them. As far as I understand it, and I hope the Minister will prove me wrong, there is bound to be an effect on the rents payable at the moment following the transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to try and pin him down if possible as to whether the "undue financial burden" which may be continued under Clause 9 will be calculated on the basis of all the councils involved or individual councils. This will obviously have a great bearing on the extent of opposition and to the financial implications of these transfers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also, quite apart from the effects on the new towns, the real question of ensuring that national assets are being protected, because the older new towns historically have low interest charges. Therefore any council that could benefit from a transfer to it of assets will be in a favourable position, whereas the later new
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
towns, second generation and later, will be in a comparatively unfavourable situation. This is why I am trying to establish whether this will be taken on the individual council transfer basis or the totality. It is a real point when we come in considering the Exchequer subsidy in Clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to consider, for instance, in subsection (2) of this clause, when we are talking about the
	<br><blockquote><p>"relevant proportion of the corporation's total capital loan debt"</p></blockquote>
whether that should not in fact be "total capital expenditure" rather than just a loan debt. This is a point made strongly to me by the New Towns' Association. I would presume it would have made some representations to the Department on this point, but it has not been the subject of a Government amendment. I hope the Minister will be able to turn to it in his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to realise that these provisions are very complicated and are not easy for laymen like ourselves, without the official resources at the Minister's beck and call, to understand. I would ask him for some overall assurance that there has been a considered look at these provisions and their effect and that the Association of District Councils and the new town corporations have been given a full opportunity to comment and that their comments have been assessed in the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is certainly the understanding of my corporation in a letter to me of a comparatively recent date. I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Financial arrangements are involved and I understand that these are to be looked at urgently by experts."</p></blockquote>
It goes on somewhat later:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is of course a real problem of the loan debt burden."</p></blockquote>
I would hope the Minister can be forthcoming in his reply and inform the Committee what considerations have been given to these comments. What assessment has been made of this in his Department? Can he assure the Committee he is satisfied with the provisions as they now stand in the light of the comments and assessments made thereon?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
I would like to add my voice to what has been said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister ought to declare his intentions on this one without any beating about the bush. We want a clear statement on what the intention of this clause is. We want to know whether any undue burden will be placed on the local community, whether the housing tenants or the ratepayers. It is awfully easy in Parliament to theorise and it is awfully easy to legislate. There has been a lot of local disquiet about the way the new town situation has been administered in the past, and a lot of feeling, often wrong and often whipped up politically within the constituencies, that the ratepayers are being unduly burdened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like the Minister now to take this opportunity of explaining clearly to the Committee—perhaps even by a "yes" or a "no", though I know it is politically difficult to get that—whether there will be any burden, as a result of this transfer, on local people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add to what my hon. Friend has said. I also have sympathy with the point of the amendment. I want to emphasise to the Minister that outside Parliament there will be deep concern which will certainly not be limited to the political sympathisers of hon. Members oppposite on this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, in a number of new towns, certainly in Harlow, the level of rents imposed by councils is lower than the level of those for corporation properties. If the result of the transfer were to be to impose a considerable upsurge in the level of rents many people in new towns generally would feel that the Treasury had made use of the Bill to unload a burden on to the residents of new towns. It would cause considerable disquiet. The Minister will realise that concern about this is not limited merely to those who support the objectives of the Conservative Party. I, like my hon.

Members may have on the amendments selected on Clauses 8 and 9. I hope we can cover the points which concern hon. Members and their constituents, however we do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way I can do it, by way of introduction to an answer to this amendment, is to explain as clearly as I can the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
intention behind Clause 8, because the clause sets out the basis on which a district council will make payment to the new town corporation for buildings and other land transferred to the council or are to be subject to management arrangements under a transfer scheme. Also, it specifies consequential arrangements for the payment of housing subsidies to the district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic provision which underlies the financial provisions for the transfer of houses and associated assets and the making of a management arrangement is that the transfer of the corporation's interest in the assets is not a sale. It is rather a transfer of responsibility from one public body to another. The objective is to change the ownership and management of rented houses held by new town corporations without involving the corporation or the local authority in profit or in loss. That is the basic intention, and for this reason the working party on the transfer of rented houses in new towns recommended that the financial basis of transfer should be the assumption by the local authority of the servicing of the outstanding loan debt in respect of the property concerned. This principle is being followed both where ownership is being transferred and where property is subject to management arrangements under a transfer scheme, and it is reflected in the somewhat involved provisions of the whole clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought it was right to give that kind of introduction to the Committee because it is an involved clause and has caused some confusion and worry to some people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now my duty to turn to the amendment moved formally by the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison), I think, although the speech was made by the hon. Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris). I should explain that the present situation under the clause, as the hon. Member explained, is that subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>) gives a discretion to the Secretary of State to pay an increased basic element of housing subsidy in the next financial year following the date when any particular land or buildings are managed by the council for the first time pursuant to management arrangements in a transfer scheme, if that date is after the beginning of the year in which the transfer of dwellings takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
The effect of this amendment would be to substitute a mandatory requirement for the discretionary power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the coming into force of the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975 certain housing subsidies, based on the state of the housing revenue account or housing account respectively, were payable under the provisions of the Housing Finance Act 1972 to local authorities and new town corporations. The relevant provisions of the Act were, however, repealed by the 1975 Act and provision was made in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the latter Act for a consolidation of those 1972 Act subsidies for 1974–75 into the basic element of housing subsidy under the 1975 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment is possibly based on a misunderstanding of this subsection (5), which is solely concerned with adjustment of the basic element of housing subsidy—which is the aggregate of certain subsidies payable for 1974–75 under the Housing Finance Act 1972. Since the land or buildings referred to in subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>) may not necessarily have been in the corporation's housing account in 1974–75 it would obviously be wrong to provide in the paragraph for any automatic increase in the amount of the council's basic element. The same point would apply to subsection (5)(	<i>a</i>), although, curiously, the Opposition amendment does not suggest that this provision also be made mandatory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Relevant expenditure incurred on or after 1st April 1975 may qualify for the capital costs element of housing subsidy. Subsection (4) makes the necessary provision to ensure that after transfer the district council receives the appropriate capital costs element of housing subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause and these amendments are the nub of the problem. These four amendments seek to tighten the wording of this clause because we are primarily concerned here with the situation where the Government need to make a grant to a district council arising out of the costs incurred under the transfer scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 43 is putting a little more meat on to the opening of the clause where it says;
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where it appears to the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
I do not think it should be left entirely to the Secretary of State casually to look at the situation and to say, after studying it, that it appears to him that there is due cause. There should be provision for the parties involved, backed up by duly audited accounts, to prove to the Minister that there is a case. We have provisions for auditing accounts and costs. It seems appropriate that when there has been a proper audit carried out and signed as a correct financial statement, and the figures are put before the Secretary of State he should have no option but to accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For Amendment No. 45 very much the same argument applies, but it is even more important because we are dealing directly with money. There should be no option for the Secretary of State to opt out—he positively should have to opt in. That is why we have made it definitive by proposing "may" instead of "shall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
Amendment No. 46 is saying that there should be no case for a Treasury grant, but if there is a case made out there should be no option for the Treasury but to pay for the lot. There should be no deal in which part of the burden falls on the district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 47 makes it absolutely clear that as long as there is any form of burden arising from the transfer the costs incurred should not fall on the local community but should be borne by the Treasury. It is appropriate here for me to read just how that part of the clause would read if our three latter amendments were carried:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or will impose an undue financial burden on the council, he shall for the purpose of relieving that burden make grants to the council of amounts and for so long as there is a burden determined by him…"</p></blockquote>
I believe that these four amendments are very important because the experience of councils up and down the country has not been entirely happy. On the whole there has been too much wrangling, and too little sympathy from the Treasury. Even today, after detailed negotiations, there are situations where people in Government are arguing with local authorities as to what is or what is not a burden. I have in mind particularly educational costs, the lack of provision for them in the rate support grant, and the increasing burden when young families come in with small children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when the Minister replies he will give a cast-iron assurance that there will be no burden on the local community. At the moment what is not provided for by subsidy is picked up by Government. There is a third element here—the ratepayers, who are the vast majority of people in any form of tenure. Some people escape, but in a local community in some way or another everyone will be affected and it is totally unacceptable if even one penny is put on the rates in any form as a result of a transfer scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving these amendments to make the situation as watertight as possible. There may be technical deficiencies in the amendments. If so, I will listen carefully to what the Minister says about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the Clause stand part of the Bill, with these amendments so that we can have a fairly wide debate on the financial aspects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As these are fairly clear-cut amendments I think we will stick to them. Wider debate can be raised on the Question, that the Clause stand part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Stevenage Working Party Report, to which reference has been made already, there is a discussion in paragraph 4.10 of the principles behind the transfer. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our final criterion is the financial implications of the transfer for all those concerned—the local authorities, the development corporations, and the Exchequer. It has seemed to us that a reasonable starting point in considering this matter should be that any transfer arrangements are such as initially to limit the financial disturbance to the various interests concerned."</p></blockquote>
That is what these amendments are about—limiting the financial disturbance to the various interests concerned. In section 6 of the report, the working party has dealt with this at much greater length. It points out that the burden is affected by the transfer of the loan debt. The Minister has not so far elucidated the question of the loan debt. One of the troubles with new town corporation loans is that they are not earmarked for anything. We would like to know how the Minister can determine what is covered by the corporation's loan debt. The report makes it quite clear when it says in paragraph 6.7:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Corporation loans are not earmarked for specific purposes and it is not therefore possible to identify particular loans as relating to the assets being transferred. Furthermore, the loan charges at present debited in corporations' housing accounts have evolved over the years under a variety of rules and regulations, rendering any clear view of their basis difficult, if not impossible."</p></blockquote>
If the working party finds it difficult if not impossible then what are we supposed to make of it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of District Councils makes its view on this matter very clear. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Two aspects require more detailed consideration and determination. The first is the apparent acceptance that grant paid under Section 42 (2) of the New Towns Act serves instead of a rate fund contribution."</p></blockquote>
I hope the Government have read these
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
representations. The association then says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The second point is the extent of the rate burden. From the outset of the proposals for the transfer of housing and related assets the local authorities have maintained that the transfer should be on the general basis of no additional burden to the Exchequer, the ratepayer or the tenant. Clearly the proposals would reduce the Exchequer's burden while increasing that of the tenants and ratepayers."</p></blockquote>
I referred to that in my speech on Second Reading. There is a widespread suspicion that the only reason the Treasury became converted to the idea that there should be a transfer of assets was that it saw the opportunity of reducing subsidies. Otherwise it had strenuously opposed the transfer, because of the need to protect national assets. There is a real fear that the Exchequer is seeking to reduce its own burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of District Councils says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is essential that a quantitative indication of rate burden is given to local authorities for use in their consideration of the desirability of transfer."</p></blockquote>
I have a feeling that the desirability of democratic control will pall considerably and significantly if accommodation is made by considerably increasing the financial burden on the local authority. That is why I ask how the burden is to be calculated. Is it to be calculated on the basis of each individual transfer, or will there be a more global basis? An increase in the burden will affect attitudes towards the desirability of a transfer scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that there are going to be some increases in rent burdens throughout council and corporation housing anyway, because of the need to reduce subsidies, but we want to distinguish clearly between such increases which were inevitable anyway, and those resulting from a transfer scheme. Otherwise the Minister will find himself in a very difficult position. There will be widespread misunderstanding about the results of the transfer. The Minister has a duty to make it plain how this is going to be worked out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of District Councils has also referred to temporary financial difficulties in housing revenue accounts of a development corporation or a local authority. It has suggested that this could be mitigated by the inclusion in the Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
of a power of cross-subsidisation along the lines of Section 18 of the Housing Subsidies Act 1965 to which the Minister referred earlier this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to be cautious about these transition payments, and whether they should be subject to the discretion of the Treasury or not. We are trying to get behind the Treasury's sudden agreement to this transfer and probe whether that is agreeable, because they will be shuffling off some of its burden on to the rent payer and the ratepayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Chair's remarks earlier I will keep my speech short and make the burden of my remarks on the Question that the clause stand part of the Bill. There is a considerable amount in what has been said by the Members opposite on this matter. A number of us remember the period when the transfer of assets was discussed previously, before 1970. At that time the Treasury took the view that housing should not be transferred if the transfer were to take place with outstanding loan debts. On that occasion I felt that the Treasury was only prepared to agree to the transfer of dwellings if it could get rid of considerable debt in so doing. Unless the clause is more tightly drawn, a future Chancellor of the Exchequer or a future Minister might not feel it necessary to take action to relieve the burden on ratepayers or tenants in a new town. While I do not necessarily agree with the wording in these amendments I do think that the possibility of a future Minister avoiding the situation has to be covered quite clearly in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Opposition amendments are not acceptable, I hope my hon. Friend will take the point that some of us on this side of the Committee feel that further steps should be taken to improve this clause so that a substantial burden cannot be put on tenants and ratepayers in new towns at a later stage. If this happened it would undoubtedly jaundice their views about the desirability of transferring assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Colquhoun</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe these amendments are not only sensible but are very much part of democracy at work. Legislation, once made, is almost impossible to undo. When we are at the stage of actually making it and when we believe it will
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
unfairly militate against our constituents, then, rightly or wrongly, it is not my view that we on this side of the Committee should support the Government. The Minister must understand that we regard it as a very serious matter indeed that local communities should be protected from any increased financial burden arising out of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the Minister that I am totally committed, both in speeches I have made in my constituency, and in the work that I have undertaken, to ensure that no burdens are placed upon my constituents arising out of my work at Westminster. I am sorry to be, perhaps, intractable, or stubborn, but there is no point in people in Northampton sending me to Westminster if, when I get here, as a result of being a member of a Committee, I then go against what I strongly feel, and against my view that perhaps there are occasions when I should not put the party first. Can I assure the Minister that my objection is not personal? However because I feel so strongly I will support this group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Guy Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I probably need to start by dealing with a specific point raised by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove and Redditch (Mr. Miller), who seemed to imply that it would be difficult to determine the fair proportion of loan debt which could be attributed to housing. It could be a difficult problem because, as he knows, and as is made clear by the way the Bill is drafted, one cannot refer to the new towns housing account because this is not statutorily required. This need not create any difficulty as far as we are concerned because the general principle is to have the proportion of capital expenditure spent on housing in each year by the town's development. All I am saying is that we do not anticipate any difficulty in getting agreement between individual authorities and corporations on the loan debt involved in the transfer of housing assets. We do not, at the moment, foresee difficulty in doing that sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are relieved to hear that the Government do not anticipate any difficulty, but the Minister must be aware that there has been considerable discussion, particularly about such things as minor roads which service housing estates in some of the industrial areas and where, because of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
nature of the development, the road is used by industrial traffic although, originally, it may have been conceived as a road for the housing estate. I think the Minister is possibly being a little over-confident in assuming that there will not actually be any serious debate on this point. If we take another Act, the Housing Compensation Act, all of us know that if the Government were to be more generous there would be less argument. Could we have an assurance from the Minister, for the record, that the Treasury will generously look at areas of disagreement? If so, I think the happy situation which the Minister has suggested will come about. However, if the Treasury looks at this problem as it has looked at previous problems, and is not prepared to shift, then I do not think the point the Minister makes is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I do not think the issue which the hon. Gentleman has raised is relevant to this debate. If I understand him correctly he raises the issue whether this or that asset is part of the transfer. It would be a subject for consultations and negotiations, whether this, that or the other minor road is involved in the transfer or not. If it is, then the loan debt relating to that particular asset will also be part of the transfer. That is my understanding of the situation. I was attempting to reassure the Committee in respect of the actual decision about the size of the loan debt in relation to the particular asset. There may be a problem about which particular assets are to be transferred, but they will be a subject for discussions and consultations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Morris</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not asking for a list of which assets are included in the transfer. All I am saying is that there are certain ancilliary services associated with housing which will go to the district council. Yet the New Towns Commission will still benefit because the industrial element remains with the New Towns Commission. There will be arguments about whether part of the debt should not still be borne by the New Towns Commission, because its industrial element will be using a portion of the actual asset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My answer to the hon. Gentleman is that issues of this kind will, somehow, have to be agreed before the
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
transfer goes through. As he knows, the transfer would not be limited to housing, because housing-related assets would be included in a transfer scheme. However, I recognise that in certain cases, and in certain places, there will be certain assets about which there may be disagreement—such as whether a road is a housing asset or whether it is a feeder road for industrial purposes. There will inevitably be disagreement in some cases about marginal assets of this kind, and this is what the consultations will be about. Once the decision has been made about whether this or that minor road, or piece of development, is part of the scheme, I do not think there should be an enormous amount of difficulty in establishing the loan debt which relates to that particular asset. That is all I am saying, and that is why I have tried to clear up the doubt that existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should now turn to the amendments and say at the outset that I well understand the degree to which there is anxiety about the financial effects in particular cases. The clause provides for the Secretary of State to make grants to the district council where it appears to him that the transfer of management arrangements will impose an undue financial burden on the council so as to relieve that burden wholly or partly. The effect of Opposition Amendments Nos. 43 and 45 would be to make it mandatory for the Secretary of State to make such grants where it either appeared to him, or was proved to him, that an undue financial burden would be imposed by transfer. Amendment No. 46 would seem to require the Secretary of State to relieve any such burden in its entirety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all honesty I have to try to tackle something which inevitably worries everyone—the possibility of rents or rates going up. One interesting characteristic of this debate has been the kind of nomenclature which all politicians are apt to use according to whose interests they happen to be defending. If it is the ratepayers' interest, or the rent payers' interest, then it is the council's fault. We were constantly reminded in this debate of what the Treasury was likely to do, but hon. Members completely forgot that the Treasury obtains its money from the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it is unfair to introduce this question of the consideration of the taxpayers' interest. It is worth the Committee's bearing in mind that, whatever
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
decision we come to, the taxpayer has already supported a massive investment in new towns. In due course, and in another context, we shall be discussing how the return on the nation's investment in our new towns can be shared between the local community, the new town's programme as a whole, and, through the Exchequer, the public in general. This is not to say that the Exchequer should not take steps to ease the financial burden which might exist for a period of time. However, I think the Committee will agree that it would not be reasonable to ask the taxpayer to be financially responsible if the calculation of the size of the burden were to be based on the wholly unreasonable policies of a district council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a possibility with which the Committee has to contend and which it has to face. We have said, in support of our policy of transferring housing in new towns to the local authorities, that we are taking
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
the first important step to turning our new towns into normal towns, but we would be failing in our objective if we did not encourage the new town local authorities to adopt sensible policies which are also directed to the achievement of normality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would be reducing the chances of reaching a state of normality if it were to be mandatory that the Secretary of State gives grant aid for as long as it is needed, or as long as some kind of financial burden exists. We have sought to avoid inflexible formulae based on the provisions which existed in the new town authorities 30 years ago. When the transfers take place in the 1980s, against a possible background of a new structure of housing subsidies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
