	<div class='legislation'>The Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act 1976 (Modification) (No. 2) Order 1978</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.38 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act 1976 (Modification) (No. 2) Order 1978 (S.I. 1978, No. 1939).</p></blockquote>
I begin by thanking the Minister for allowing for a slight delay in the commencement of the Committee's proceedings. I also congratulate him on the advances that have been made in this modification order before us. The advances regarding the import and export of ivory, covered in paragraph 7, and of reptile skins, covered in paragraph 16, represent valuable improvements. It is thoroughly satisfactory that we in this country should be starting to take a more aggressive and responsible attitude towards the international trade in such articles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My enthusiasm for what the Minister has done has been slightly tempered by the fact that it will be really effective only if it is enforced. It is in the enforcement provisions of most of these instruments and of the Act that most concern has arisen. If we are to be able to say a really sincere thank you to the Minister and his Department for what they have done in the order, that can only be when it is clear to us all that proper and strict enforcement of the provisions is being undertaken. None the less, nothing that I say will in any way detract from the fact that the instrument represents a step forward, and on that the Minister and his Department are to be congratulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a number of points that fall broadly under three headings: first, the method by which the order has been made and its timing; secondly, some highly specific matters about the inclusions and exclusions covered in the instrument, and in particular the definitions of various categories of mammals and reptiles; and thirdly—bearing in mind how narrowly drawn the instrument is—I hope that I shall be allowed to stray a little wider in order to discuss some of the broader implications of the instrument and of those that have preceded it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I know very well that not all the points I shall make will lie within the purview of the Minister. The Minister knows my view that there are other Departments of Government which have been extremely unhelpful and slack—" slack " is not too strong a word—in carrying out their undertakings and responsibilities under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act. I think that privately the Minister would probably support the view that his Department is not necessarily given all the assistance which it looks for from other Government Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, when I am critical of what is being done under the Act, some of that criticism will quite unfairly appear to be aimed at the Minister's Department, whereas it should be aimed at other Departments, which we can never get at when we debate the matter. If the Minister feels that I am being unfair, I assure him that the criticism is because we cannot get at those Government Departments which are so often responsible for the real guts of the enforcement of the statutory instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not seek to make any party political or national points, but to make an international point of the broadest and most important type. The phrase "space ship earth" has been used to describe the world, its inter-relationships and its ecosystem. We are discussing an implication of space ship earth. Strikes may come and strikes may go, but if, because we fail to draft and examine these orders sufficiently closely, we allow one or more species to be wiped out, there is no going back over that ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that, although the matter does not necessarily attract a tremendous amount of attention in the House, we are dealing with fundamental issues which will not just affect the world for the next four or five years, but which will affect the animal population of the world for ever. So when we go into details and find ourselves involved with Latin titles and with what may appear to be minor matters, the issues underlying them are extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the timing of the statutory instrument. The Minister knows my interest in the subject. When it was announced in the press in the middle of October that the order would be brought forward, I wrote to him to make a number of points and to ask what specific provisions would be included in it. I wrote to the Minister on 30 October, and on 20 November I received a letter from him which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
covered in broad terms the points that he proposed to include in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was fine. But I was extremely disappointed to note that subsequently the order was made on 22 December, laid on 29 December and came into force on 19 January. I can only describe that as being less than helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that I and other hon. Members have a particular interest in this subject. To make an instrument of this sort three days before Christmas, to complete it between Christmas and the New Year, and to bring it into force on 19 January, four days after Parliament has reassembled, does not seem to be the most helpful way of promoting a full and detailed discussion of proposals which many of us believe to be extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed that this rather helter-skelter approach was taken in bringing the order into effect. I shall be grateful if the Minister can indicate some of the thinking behind the need for that timing, with the order being made just after the House had gone into Recess, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the specifics of the order. It is necessary for me to go into a little detail here and, unfortunately, it involves jumping about to various parts of the order. Paragraph 15, on page 4, deals with:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Musk derived from any animal of the species Moschus moschiferus (musk deer)."</p></blockquote>
For the benefit of the Committee I shall expand on the reasons and on our concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Musk is used as a perfume fixative. An ordinary perfume placed on the skin quickly evaporates. It is, therefore, given additional body and, as it were, staying power by the addition of a fixative. Ambergris, which comes from the stomach of a whale, and musk are the two most commonly used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process by which musk is extracted is particularly horrible and cruel. In particular, although it is not included in the order, the civet cat is foully- ill-treated in an effort to get it to give its musk. Animals will secrete musk only when they are maltreated, angry or frightened. For example, the civet cat is kept in a small box about the size of the top of a desk. It is never let out and every three or four months it is poked with a stick and enraged in order to get it to secrete musk. The films of this procedure are particularly horrible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order deals with musk from deer.
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The civet cat is not endangered and, therefore, does not fall within the purview of the order. However, musk from deer is used for similar purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear whether the order will prohibit perfumes or other articles in which musk is suspended. It is all very well to say that musk is prohibited, but one rarely imports musk as musk. Perfume manufacturing in this country is small. Nearly all the trade in musk in this country is through perfumes and fixatives of one sort or another. I hope that the Minister will make clear whether the use of musk derived from the musk deer is likely to fall within the prohibition of this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we referring to musk in its distilled state or in its used state? That is important. If the Minister says that it is musk in the former category, in its distilled state, the paragraph is worthless, because imports and exports of it are negligible. However, a great deal of it comes to this country in the form of perfume. I await the Minister's comments on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn, secondly, to paragraphs 17 and 18 on pages 4 and 5. These paragraphs deal with the turtle. Paragraph 17 covers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The whole or any part of the bony shell and its covering".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 17(2) relates to the claws, and paragraph 18 to "The meat and cartilage".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowhere does the order refer to turtle oil, which is in fact the most valuable part of the turtle. It is used in expensive soaps and perfumes. While it is quite useful and valuable to have a prohibition on the trade in the shell of the turtle, the question is whether this will cover the oil of the turtle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, does the definition of "The meat and cartilage" include the oil, which is presumably partially suspended within that meat and cartilage? It is critical that we know the answer to this question for similar reasons, namely, whether this is to be prohibited and whether it will be prohibited in terms of the pure state or in terms of soaps and perfumes which may be made from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that Her Majesty's Customs and Excise—that wonderful body of men—cannot identify turtle oil, or claims that it cannot do so. It may be useful if the Minister can say what steps he intends to take to ensure that it can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of skins. Paragraph 9(3) relates to the raw skins of animals. It reads:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Tanned or dressed furskin of a defined animal … assembled in plates, rectangles, crosses, trapeziums or otherwise."</p></blockquote>
I understand that last year there were problems over the imports of leopard skins. It is illegal to import leopard skins individually. But a loophole was found in the provisions by sewing the leopard skins together to make them into bedspreads. They were then imported as furnishings. If we now have a similar provision in paragraph 9(3), will this block that loophole? The words "or otherwise" seem to be the critical ones. Will the importers and exporters of animal skins merely find another way to get around this prohibition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, there are all sorts of ways in which one could bring in leopard skins. They could be brought in as coverings on chairs, sofas and so on. Once it is here a sofa is dismantled and the leopard skin can be resold in its raw state. Undoubtedly that has happened in the course of the past 12 months. Her Majesty's Customs and Excise claims that it could not recognise leopard skins sewn together into a bedspread. Again, I ask the Minister to say what action he will take to ensure that the Customs and Excise takes a reasonable and common-sense analytical approach to this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to paragraph 16, on page 4, dealing with reptile hides. Obviously, this covers footwear, watchstraps, belts and so on. What is not clear is whether the provisions of paragraph 9(3) prevent the clever spotting of loopholes in the case of reptile skins, such as producing a chair covered in crocodile skin, sewing it together and dismantling it once it is inside this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the new prohibitions in paragraph 16(2) enable us to prevent unusual or useless articles covered with the skin in question being brought in, taken to pieces and then put to use in a way which is more profitable for the importer and exporter? I should be grateful for the Minister's comments on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, with regard to the specific provisions, I should like to deal briefly with one exclusion. I believe that other members of the Committee wish to speak on this, so I simply say briefly that the great omission from the order is, of course, sperm oil. It is clear that we have to give the leather industry time to ensure that alternative products are available to replace sperm oil, which is currently of vital
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
importance to the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister could say whether he is satisfied that speedy enough progress is being made towards the day from when, as I think all of us, including the British Leather Federation agree, it will be desirable and possible to prohibit the import of sperm oil. We are not asking him to introduce the prohibition now. I understand the industrial problems that would arise. But it would be helpful if he could put on record what progress is being made in this area, which has aroused great public concern, and say whether he feels that that progress is fast enough to enable a prohibition to be introduced in the near future. Perhaps he can give us some idea of the timing on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the specific points that I wished to make. In conclusion, I return to two broad aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opening remarks I mentioned the question enforcement. If the order is to be worth the paper it is written on, it must be enforced rigorously and universally throughout the country, because those who deal in endangered species are astute and clever, and are quite able to find ways round the more obvious points and ports of entry to this country. The profits are such that it is worth while doing that. We must therefore have strict and universal enforcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem here is divided responsibility for enforcement. As the Minister knows, I am highly critical of the Customs and Excise performance in this area and of its part in the United Kingdom's contribution to international treaties on this matter. When I wrote to the Financial Secretary last year about this, he replied—and, frankly, he hid behind the Minister's Department—in a letter dated 25 April:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Customs and Excise Act 1952 empowers Customs to permit transshipment of prohibited or restricted goods, but in exercising this power Customs are guided by the Department responsible for the prohibition or restriction concerned, in this case the Department of the Environment."</p></blockquote>
The ball was thus flung firmly back into the Minister's court. As I understand it, if he tells them what is to be prohibited and restricted, Customs and Excise officials will undertake those restrictions and prohibitions. I hope that the Minister will give us a clear undertaking this morning that he intends to sling the ball back into their court, so that those of us who feel strongly about this matter can bring the appropriate pressure to bear on the Customs and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Excise Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Minister's Department has never yet issued any code of practice regarding this order or previous orders. The question is why such a code of practice has not been produced. When we were discussing turtles, I mentioned paragraph 17(2), which refers to:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Anything made wholly or partly from the bony shell".</p></blockquote>
But people do not arrive carrying turtle shells. They arrive carrying bangles made of turtle shell on their wrists. Products of this type are not obvious, in that they are often of an ornamental nature and as such not immediately recognisable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister were able to tell us this morning that his Department was producing a child's guide that would be available to Customs officers, outlining the more common forms in which such products are imported into this country around the wrists or neck, or state by what other means they might be imported. Customs officers would then be able to make a realistic attempt at enforcement. It is understandable that long lists of Latin names mean nothing to the Customs desk at Heathrow airport. It must be impossible to sort them out. But a child's guide would be most helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that people have purposely brought prohibited articles through Customs at Heathrow. They have declared them and Customs officers have done nothing because they did not know about the matter. In many cases Customs officers are more interested in making sure that people have not brought in an extra bottle of Scotch than in ensuring that this country does not play its part in moving towards the wiping out of another species.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take a tougher and much more realistic attitude towards Customs officers' duties and put the ball in their court by producing an informative guide that is available to them and to travellers generally. I know that he will have much support if he does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people would be horrified to think that they were carrying a turtleshell bracelet which came from an endangered species. They would not know, so let us tell them. Let us inform the public, so that they may play their part in ensuring that this country keeps its hands clean in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is the question of transshipment. The order deals with additions to the list of endangered species and for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
first time extends it to cover parts of animal shells, skins and so on, and that is most welcome. But the fact is that because Heathrow airport remains one of the busiest airports in the world, much trade goes through there. Many Third World airlines terminate at Heathrow, and it becomes a trans-shipment point for many animals falling within this category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows that there are loopholes there. One of these is the use of the temporary import licence. The question is how the order will affect that loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system that is, quite simply, a dealer will bring the animals in from abroad and leave them here for 28 days while he circulates other dealers, gets his auction over, marks up his goods and ships them on, having switched airfreight tickets meanwhile. The Minister knows that this happens on a large scale. There are several well-documented cases about it, even though it is kept as far below the parapet as possible. Blind eyes are turned all over the place. It is fair that we should ask this morning whether this order will also have blind eyes turned to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is a signatory to the convention, and there is no doubt that the fact that goods have come from the United Kingdom in the first place is seen in their country of destination as a clear indication that there are proper import and export documents and restrictions relating to an animal. The United Kingdom is used for a washing effect, so to speak, which enables the dealer, first, to make a substantial profit and, secondly, to switch his sales of endangered animals to whichever part of the world offers him the best reward. If this statutory instrument is to be effective we must have indications that the trans-shipment provisions are to be closed up tightly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end as I began, by thanking the Minister for the steps that his Department have taken with regard to the order. It is a worthy step forward and one that I certainly applaud. But there are a number of specific points which make the order less satisfactory than it might otherwise be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also several important general points which mean that this country—not because of the Minister's Department but because of other Departments—is not playing its full role in the protection of endangered species. The Minister must give a clear indication of the detailed and the general points relating to this order as to how his Department proposes in future to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
tighten up the provisions, thereby ensuring that we do our bit—perhaps our little bit, but our bit none the less—to ensure that other species will not follow the many that have gone down the road to extinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.5 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is sad that we had to have primary legislation in this field, and in a sense it is sadder that we are now dealing with this order. It is testament to the cruelty which we inflict upon those animals with whom we share this planet and it underlines the fact that the pillage and plunder in which we are engaged, in this country as well, show no signs of abating and, in many areas, grow worse. I think that that needs to be said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the order is a most unsatisfactory way in which to deal with this matter. I know that we are bound by the rules and procedures of Parliament, but all the while that six or seven Government Departments at least are involved in various aspects of protecting endangered species and enforcing the existing legislation or are involved with animal welfare and matters generally, we shall have the present wholly unsatisfactory situation. I am not blaming by hon. Friend for this; it is the situation which exists. But I hope that the House will better concern itself with this problem and perhaps give some attention to the suggestion of a standing Royal Commission over the whole subject of animal welfare and protection. Such a Commission could be independent but could investigate and make recommendations, so that the House is brought much more fully into this field—and can give specific instructions to the Government Departments with bits and pieces of this responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson), in the letter which he read from the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, illustrated the point precisely. One goes the way one thinks power resides— and where else does it reside but in the Treasury, which is responsible for the operations of the Customs and Excise, only to be told by the person holding that responsibility "It is not really my responsibility. It belongs to the Department of the Environment." Who on earth would think of the Department of the Environment in this context, when one meets a Customs and Excise man? If that is the way in which the Government have decided
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
that they will deal with these matters, it lays a double responsibility upon my hon. Friend to see that the intention of Parliament behind these measures shall be properly enforced, and that those charged with the responsibilities of seeing that they are enforced and respected should be given every help to know what they are dealing with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that we ask a great deal of Customs and Excise officers, and I take the hon. Gentleman's point that perhaps they are more interested in whisky and a few packets of cigarettes than they are in some of these other matters. But, to be generous to them, perhaps we could help them to understand what they are looking for and to give them all help and encouragement in that respect, so that we can see that even the rules and regulations currently before us are being properly applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am minded—I think that the Committee can do this—to recommend changes in the order. I say "recommend", because the order cannot be amended. I want to put two specific proposals to the Committee, and in particular to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder just how long we in this country will tolerate the annual slaughter of harp seals in Canada. I know that that is in Canadian territory. However, the result of that barbarity on the ice, which is about to start again, turns up in this country in the form of those animals' skins. About a year ago there was a suggestion from the Department of Trade and from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—both of which had looked at the matter—that steps would be proposed to try to ban the importation of such skins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see what possible valid reason there is for this Government at this time— it is a recommendation that I want to make in respect of this order—not to say flatly "We shall no longer allow the importing of such skins into this country". It is a moral matter. The cruelty aspect—anybody who has seen films on the subject will be aware of it—is absolutely appalling, because of the manner in which the pups are literally clubbed to death and their heads broken open. We are told that, so expert are those who carry out this butchery, one blow can kill. There is no evidence of that whatever; in fact, there is a lot of evidence to the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order that we are discussing is deficient in that respect. We should have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
the opportunity of saying flatly to those responsible in Canada "You carry on with this if you like, since it is your territory—although we should prefer you not to do it. But we shall see that the British market is closed to the end result of that barbarity". Of course, the Canadians are not very proud of what will happen. The whole area has been virtually closed off, and the Canadians are taking what steps they can to ensure that the eyes of the world do not see what happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have allowed the hon. Gentleman to make the point, but he is dealing with a matter that does not specifically concern the order. I presume that the hon. Gentleman is coming to the end of that comment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Davies. I hope that the efforts of the Canadian Government to hide this matter from the world will be frustrated. I have every reason to believe that they will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Walsall, North mentioned sperm whale oil. There is no need for me, or anyone else in the Committee, to make a long speech about whales. It is fair to acknowledge that there has been a recent change in the attitude of Her Majesty's Government on the matter. Unhappily, that does not solve the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as much of the whale population is concerned, we are near to driving the animals into extinction. It is all the more maddening, and the more saddening, that we come along late in the development of the world's ecology, and see fit to plunder and drive into extinction animals which we have joined along that chain and for which we are alleged to have some responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to the British Leather Federation, it makes the point—perhaps the Minister will look at it, before making his recommendations—that sperm whale oil is incorporated in some products supplied by others for the softening of leather. Therefore, to a large extent the federation is dependent on its suppliers to inform it whether sperm whale oil has been used. It would be a step along the right path if
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
we were to consider asking for a declaration by those suppliers of the British Leather Federation whether sperm whale oil has been used. I accept that that would not solve the problem, but it would give us better information than we have at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is again going wide of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Davies. May I finish on one point? I hope that the Minister—whom I know has proper regard for the matter, and I do not say that lightly—will do what he can to encourage the British Leather Federation to extend both the pace and scope of its research to find substitutes for sperm oil and to voluntarily enter an undertaking on the period over which this would be phased out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I find it excessively sad that we have to label animals as endangered as a result of the pillage and plunder which we have carried out. But that said, I believe that there are some welcome additions in the order, and I hope that the Minister be able to respond in a positive way to the two points I have made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the more pleasing aspects of my five years in this House—many hon. Members, if they are completely honest with themselves, think that a great deal of their time in this Palace is not used to best advantage— involves the time spent dealing with the problems of conservation, the protection of wild life, and endangered species in particular. I am delighted that during my time in the House the 1976 Act was introduced. We have made progress. The Government should be given credit for that, and for the fact that we are now, two years later, adding to the list originally introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) on a very comprehensive speech. He raised many matters which concern more and more people in the House and a vast number of our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Corbett) that we in the United Kingdom also club seals. At about this time last year I delivered to the Canadian High Commission a petition from my own constituency containing a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
vast number of names. Although I was horrified about what was happening in the Orkney Islands, it appears that we will kill off most of our seals with the oil we are emitting from tankers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some research is badly called for, because there has been no increase in the seal population off the Scillies. I do not know why they are increasing in such numbers, as we are told, in the North of Scotland. But we would like to know more about that before we allow the destruction of seal pups to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6,1 am delighted to see, refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>The whole or any part, or anything made wholly or partly therefrom, of any tooth of any mammal".</p></blockquote>
Clearly that applies to whales as well as other mammals. How will that be enforced? This point was raised by the hon. Minister for Walsall, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Japan abounds with whales' teeth. As more and more people are visiting that country, not only do Customs officers want information on this point, but people who leave here on short visits should also be given detailed information on what they cannot bring back to make sure that they do not support this trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see the importation of all whale products banned. I am delighted that the Government have taken a lead in stopping the cleaning of army boots with whale oil. Substitutes must be found or, as the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead said, the whale will exist no more. The whale is disappearing on a vast scale. It would be better for the leather trade not to press for the continued importation of sperm oil and, for its own protection, to endeavour to find a substitute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When in Japan I was told that I was out of court when I asked the foreign secretary of Japan what he was doing to stop the killing of whales. He would not answer me. Apparently, a large number of jobs aie connected with the trade. But at the next convention we should hammer home our views. I hope that the Minister, if he attends, will take that opportunity to do so. If Japan will only take the lead, the Russians will quickly follow, and then the whole trade will, thank Heaven, stop. If that happens whilst I am still in Parliament, I shall be well satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to otters, which are dealt with in paragraph 5(
	<i>b</i>) on page 3. I am delighted that in England and Wales the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
otter is now a protected species. But I understand that it is not the case in Scotland. What is the position of someone on an otter hunt, or somebody who kills an otter, in Scotland? Is he not entitled to make a jacket, cape or stole from otter skin? Why can we not extend the protection of the otter to Scotland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last question I wish to raise was also raised by the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson), and it concerns the bony shell and scales of turtles, terrapins and tortoises. That question is being avoided at present. A prosecution recently failed because the person who had imported the turtle shells claimed that some work had been done on them before they came in. That provision will be extraordinarily difficult to implement. I should like the Minister to tell us whether, following that case, the Government are tightening up the rules in this area. I am not sure how they can, because the rules seem wide open to abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should welcome a ban on the importation of the ordinary garden tortoise into this country. It is a ghastly story. They come in in large numbers, and are sold cheaply in pet shops. How many of them die on their way here? How many of them—I should think hundreds of thousands—will have perished this winter because they have not been properly protected from the very cold weather? This is not the climate in which they should live and we should put a ban on the whole importation of tortoises from Greece and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that, I welcome the further move forward in the direction of giving protection to endangered species. I hope we are still in time. In some areas I think it is already too late. But if the Minister can give us some additional information and explain what he hopes we may be able to achieve later at the Costa Rica convention, and what progress there may be from other countries in the world on giving greater protection, that will be well worth hearing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.24 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Kenneth Marks)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to learn that the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Hodgson) will not oppose the order. In fact he expressed some pleasure at our having introduced it. As he said, it is already in effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the timing, as soon as we received the minimum list from the three countries,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
I felt we should introduce an order as soon as possible, so that we could show at Costa Rica that it had worked, even if it were working for only two or three months. I had hoped that it would be before 22 December—at the end of November or the beginning of December—but a printing difficulty caused delay. There was no intention on my part to avoid parliamentary debate on the matter. Looking at the dates—22 December to 19 January—I must admit that the hon. Gentleman has a point, but I am sure he would not feel that I or the Department wanted to avoid debate on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said a great deal about Customs and Excise. I had a feeling that he must once have been stopped at Dover and had the boot of his car emptied, or something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly support the broad approach of the hon. Gentleman and other hon. Members to the need for constant vigilance over endangered species, vulnerable species and, indeed, those not affected by the order, such as seals and others where cruelty is involved. It is not my particular area, but I take note of what my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Corbett) said about that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank hon. Members for expressing the feeling that this country and the Government have done something to improve our good record in this area. A great deal of the international legislation in this regard, and on the protection of birds and so on, is based on this country's legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should give the background to the order and explain why we are dealing with the matter by an order under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act. The Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora—the Washington Convention to most of us—was signed in 1973 and ratified in this country in 1976. The Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act was passed later that year to replace temporary powers taken when ratifying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Convention has two categories of control of general importance. First, for species in danger of extinction because of trade there are restrictions which effectively ban commercial trade. For the second category—species threatened by or vulnerable to trade—there are controls designed to monitor but not restrict trade, with the intention that countries where
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
trade in a species is likely to endanger its survival will get early warning of the threat and take their own preventive measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom has only one species, the peregrine, which is listed as endangered on the international list, but we are one of the major consumers and processors of exotic leathers, furs and ivory, so our controls in support of the Convention are designed to ensure that imports and trade in wild life can be monitored and restricted by the Customs and Excise and by the police as required by the Convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crucial in these controls is the listing of parts and derivatives of endangered and vulnerable species. Whereas live animals and whole carcasses are all controlled— except for domesticated species and a few very plentiful wild ones—parts and derivatives are treated differently and are specified in schedule 3 of the Act. This ranges from whale products to feathers, and was drawn up to ensure that all prime products were controlled in such a way that Customs officers could be expected to recognise that the specimen would be subject to licensing. It was a comprehensive but not exhaustive list, and even in that form we are satisfied that the bulk of trade in endangered species products was controlled on entry into the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Convention the requirement is to control listed species and their "readily recognisable" parts and derivatives—what is "readily recognisable" is not defined. Unfortunately, the result has been that in all too many countries no controls of parts and derivatives have yet been established. So, at the special working session of the Convention in Geneva in 1977, the United Kingdom, Germany and Switzerland undertook to prepare a list which would establish a minimum level of control which any Customs service could be expected to operate without specialist officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This "minimum list" was finished last summer and will be submitted to the Convention when it meets in March. The authors were forced to accept that recognition of whale meat or oil by species was not practicable and as, at present, only a few whales and dolphins are listed in the appendices it would be wrong to include whale products on the minimum list. The United Kingdom, of course, already restricts imports of virtually all whale products, and we believe those controls to be effective here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0445">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Another task undertaken by this country was preparation of a review of the conservation status of all cetacea—whales, dolphins and porpoises—for the Costa Rica meeting. When the review was finished in September the Scientific Authority for Animals, our statutory advisers under the Act, recommended that the United Kingdom seek the addition of some 11 species of dolphin and porpoises to the endangered, appendix I, list and all other cetecea not on appendix I to be included on appendix 2. This we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many reasons why these proposals make good conservation sense. One porpoise or whale is as good as another for many commercial purposes. Especially apt to this discussion in justifying the listing of all cetacea is that by so doing the difficulty in distinguishing between products of species is largely removed. Customs control of whale and porpoise meat and oil should then be practicable. We shall be looking at a possible further modification after the Costa Rica conference. If our proposals are accepted we shall then argue for the inclusion of whale products on the minimum list, and we hope that all parties will undertake to control their use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the United Kingdom helped to draft the minimum list, which we support. We have gone further, and the order which the hon. Gentleman sought to annul—I should like to learn that he did not really, mean what he said—is our implementation of that minimum list. In many respects the order goes beyond that list, especially where there are problems with look-alike species. All reptile skins and many of their products are now controlled to ensure that the endangered and threatened lizards and snakes are protected. We have not introduced controls on items which are not in significant trade and which are not a reason for pressure on the species.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not yet made sperm whale oil subject to licence, as the species is not yet listed as endangered or threatened by trade. We maintain adequate trade statistics to show whether such a threat is developing. Incidentally, those statistics show that in 1970 we imported 14,341 tonnes of sperm whale oil. By 1974 it was down to 11,474 tonnes, and in 1978 it was 4,269 tonnes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
earlier to his Department's review of cetacea and the population of the various whales. He said that the species was not endangered. But in the review the Department states that its estimates of whale population are subject to an error of 80 per cent, or more. It is all very well for the Minister to say that whales are not endangered, but with that sort of order of magnitude, and the impossibility of counting whales accurately within the volume of the ocean, is not what he has just said a little too complacent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I do not sound complacent. We are discussing a measure which deals with endangered and threatened species, and we have listened to the advice of the scientific authorities. I do not have sufficient knowledge to disagree or argue with that advice, but I shall certainly look again at the point raised by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. Benyon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for arriving late, because of the weather.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of whale sperm oil, am I right in assuming that there is no difficulty about identifying imports? Are the 11,000 tonnes currently coming in actually designated as sperm whale oil, and therefore do the Customs and Excise officers have no difficulty in identifying it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have accurate records of imports of whale sperm oil, and I understand that there is no difficulty in identifying the difference between cetacea and other oils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Corbett) mentioned research by the British Leather Federation, which recently issued a Government-sponsored report on substitutes. One of the reasons for the reduction in imports is that we are constantly attempting to find substitutes. The report, incidentally, was a little pessimistic about total substitution. We must therefore consider what might happen if substitutes are not possible. We must consider the effect on trade, manufacture and employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Industry announced in December that it would sponsor further research into substitutes. Any body may apply for a grant. The research can therefore be regarded independent, and the Department will sponsor it to the tune of £50,000 in the next two years. The Department is already separately assisting the United Kingdom sperm oil refinery in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
examining the use of a plant as an alternative. The Ministry of Defence is doing much research and has cut considerably the use of sperm oil. It is impossible to say whether total substitution will eventually occur, but the aim of Government-sponsored research is to do as much as possible as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Walsall, North talked of the Customs and Excise being more interested in collecting revenue than enforcing the law. The Customs and Excise considers enforcement of these regulations as equally as important as collecting revenue. It is part of its overall preventive control. Much control does take place, and a number of confiscations have occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had better wait until I have more scientific advice on the question of musk and turtle oil and then write to the hon. Gentleman. The question of enforcement has been mentioned, as has the use of another Act. Perhaps I should explain the background. Under the Act with which we are here concerned, the principal enforcement body is clearly the Customs and Excise. I do not speak only for it today. I am speaking for the Government as a whole, I must accept some responsibility. If I do not know the answers, I shall find them and write to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions relating to sale are a matter for the police. Perhaps hon. Members know of cases that ought to be brought to the attention of the police. The issue of sale is important, as the hon. Gentleman said. He mentioned a case when introducing his Ten-Minute Bill when he suggested that a shipper could import a chimpanzee from another country with the consignment note showing Paris, and during the 28 days it was here sell it to somebody in Moscow. That would be illegal under present legislation, and there would be no need for legislation to block that loophole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the prosecutions—perhaps until recently all of them—were made not under this Act but under the Customs and Excise Act, under which much heavier penalities can be imposed. Under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act, the limit is £500, whereas, in addition to confiscation, the other Act can go to a fine three times the value of the goods, which is much more severe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Making skins into chairs and then reselling them as skins is also illegal under
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
existing legislation, if they are offered for sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the hon. Member's call for a code of practice, and in the suggestion made by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross) about letting the public know at ports what is on the list. We have been working on both these matters. An international identification manual is now being prepared, mainly at the instigation of our own Customs and Excise people. We hope that it will be ready after the Costa Rica conference. We are also preparing a guide for travellers at ports and airports on the same basis. I hope that that will be ready soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the subject of seals. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead about cruelty to seals. The seal is not at present on any international list of endangered species. The harp seal has attracted much attention. The conservation bodies—Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace—agreed to some killing in Scotland last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall have to think again about tortoises, and I shall then communicate with the hon. Member for Isle of Wight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have covered most of the questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be up a gum tree, but what about the otter? Is it not correct that the otter is still not protected in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not under the Act. I know that because I instigated it. The otter is certainly protected in England and Wales.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will happen if someone kills an otter in Scotland quite legally? Will he be allowed to use the skin or other parts of it for what is described in this measure—a cape, stole and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have to think deeply about that, and talk to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland. The point has not arisen to any great extent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.42 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hodgson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make two brief comments. As I expected, the Minister made a thorough, detailed and kind reply
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
to the questions that were asked. I am delighted to hear about the minimum list in which his Department is participating at the conference in Costa Rica, and about the review of cetacea, which is also for Costa Rica, and the possibility of further modifications after Costa Rica. I am also delighted to hear about the code of practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is good, but the Minister allowed himself to be converted into a protector of Customs and Excise. That is not good. He spoke of the need for eternal vigilance. There is no eternal vigilance in Customs and Excise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the United States introduced a prohibition on transhipment in the United States, there were in 1975 1,900 prosecutions there, in 1976 7,600 prosecutions and in 1977 21,000 prosecutions. So far in this country there have been under 30 prosecutions during the whole time that the Act has been in force. That is not eternal vigilance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the United States is a bigger country, that its population is five times as large, or whatever it happens to be, and that therefore there will be a discrepancy. But a comparison of 21,000 to 30 is too big a discrepancy, and I do not accept that Customs and Excise is being vigilant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can we give the Minister more power to push for improvements in the enforcement of this legislation? I want him to be able to say to his colleague, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, that pressure is being put on him to ensure that the law is better enforced—pressure from both sides of the House and from other people who believe that the matter is not being pushed hard enough. In this way, Customs and Excise will begin fully to understand how serious is the concern, on both sides of the House and in the country, about the way in which a blind eye is turned to many provisions of the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what the Minister is seeking to do in the order, but the only way in which we can put on that pressure is to oppose the order, so that either we can debate it again and have a broader and more far-reaching debate, or to enable the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Minister to point to opposition to the order as a reason for the Committee's dissatisfaction with the way in which matters under the Act, and under this order, are proceeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the whole Committee supports what the Minister is seeking to do in the order, but enforcement will be the key to its achievement. The order is not worth the paper it is written on unless it is enforced. The Minister cannot enforce it, nor can his civil servants. Only Customs and Excise can do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although I accept that the Minister is being reasonable in his approach this morning, has put forward a comprehensive case and has offered to answer questions later that he cannot answer now—I have nothing against him or his Department—in order to give the Minister leverage to put further pressure on Customs and Excise and to expand the debate on this subject, I ask any hon. Member who supports my views to oppose the order—not because of what it does, but because of what it does not do and may fail to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, when we divide at the end of this debate, we shall make the Minister understand that our views are strongly held and that what he has done is right, but that we must go further down the road and have another and more far-reaching debate which enables us to inform more and more members of the public of what is happening and to put further pressure on the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think that it would require an amendment to the Act to bring in trans-shipment, and the Washington convention specifically exempted trans-shipment.
