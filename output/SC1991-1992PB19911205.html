	<time>Thursday, 5th December, 1991</time>

	<p>
	<b>The Committee met at ten o'clock.</b></p>

	<p>[The Chairman of Committees in the Chair.]</p>

	<p>Clause 21 [
	<i>Annual statements of accounts</i>]:</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 19A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 19, line 21, leave out ("£10,000") and insert ("£25,000").</p></blockquote>
The noble Viscount said: In moving this amendment I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 42A and 48A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments relate to the level of income of a charity before it should comply to the provisions in the clauses referred to in these amendments. Amendment No. 19A refers to the requirement of a charity to produce accounts in a certain form as prescribed by the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 42A relates to the annual reports which are required in a certain form and Amendment No. 48A relates to annual returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the amendments affect all charities, I am speaking principally on behalf of the almshouse charities. I declare an interest in this matter as I run a small family charity at home which I am extremely worried about. If any of the amendments in my name were to be accepted, that would be of the greatest benefit to my charity. However, I should not like the Committee to feel that I am being parochial about this matter because I believe that it is an important point of principle for all small charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Government recognise that if a charity's income falls below a certain limit - and they have the figure of £10,000 - there is an added burden and cost, possibly an unnecessary burden and cost upon those charities. I am glad that the Government realise that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I believe that the figure set is too low. As regards almshouses, I believe there are 2,200 almshouse charities in the country of which 1,600 have an income of £10,000 per year or less. If the average number of almshouses in a group is six, seven or eight, which is about average, a figure of £10,000 per year is not a great deal of money to have available for all the necessary on-going repairs, painting, decorating, gardening and the provision of all sorts of things which the inhabitants expect and which one wishes to give them. I hope that that will be borne in mind when my noble friend replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendments will increase the burden as regards the amount of work carried out by the trustees concerned. I fully applaud the requirement that when trustees take on a job they should have their eyes fully opened to the responsibilities and the necessary and important work that is done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trustees of small charities - and I class small charities as those with an income of less than £25,000
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
- are bona fide people who are from the local parish and community and are not well versed in the technicalities of trusteeship and so on. They take on the responsibilities in a spirit of goodwill and do the work in their spare time. The requirement that they should stick their necks on the chopping block and take on that additional administrative paper work is heavy handed. It could well be that people will not wish to take on the responsibilities of trusteeship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there are occasions when people have no choice as regards trusteeship. There are deeds which state that by virtue of a certain appointment Mr. X, Y or Z is automatically a trustee. Often that is the local vicar and so on. Sometimes the trustees do not have much say in what they are taking on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we can discuss the principle of whether the sum set is rather low and then take matters further at a later stage. I shall listen with care to what my noble friend says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be for the convenience of the Committee if I speak to Amendment No. 20, standing in my name, which is grouped with my noble friend's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with everything that my noble friend said. I plumped for the figure of £35,000 because that is the figure at which value added tax accounting comes in. At that figure charities need to be involved in a certain amount of additional accounting. Therefore, it would be convenient to bring in both sides of the picture at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been considerable discussion about the figure with the Charity Finance Directors Group. Various figures have been put forward. It is important that I should point out that, as far as I know, all the directors are in favour of the increase of the sum in the Bill. The figure of £10,000 is impractically low. Some would prefer £25,000, some would prefer £50,000 and some would prefer £100,000. I believe that perhaps the Minister, as my noble friend suggests, could take the matter away and give it further consideration. We may then come forward on Report with a more satisfactory figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points here. First, are we satisfied that £10,000 is the right figure? The totality of evidence submitted to me and representations made lead me to believe that there is grave anxiety in the charities world that that figure of £10,000 is pitched too low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are satisfied that it is too low, we should ask what is the correct figure—should it be £20,000, £25,000 or £30,00? Like the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, I chose the figure of £35,000 because of the coincidence of that figure with the imposition of VAT. On the other hand, like the noble Lord, if the Government show some flexibility on the fact that £10,000 is too low I should not go to the stake in demanding the figure of £35,000 as opposed to £25,000. We need a justification of the figure of £10,000 from the Government which, as yet, we have not had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Earl Ferrers)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Committee that we do not wish to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
overburden the trustees of small charities. We realise that those trustees will not be able to afford expensive assistance in preparing their accounts, nor do we wish them to incur unnecessary expense. It is important that a charity's accounts contain sufficient information about its expenses to give the reader the details for which he is looking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The philosophy behind the Bill is that charities should be accountable to the public who have put their money into the public domain. The whole philosophy behind the Bill is that once the money is in the public domain the charities should be accountable. It is not very onerous to produce statements of account to say what you have done. My noble friend Lord Mountgarret said that local people are often trustees and they are not well versed in all these matters. That may well be perfectly true but they are nevertheless taking on positions of responsibility and trust. Therefore, it is right that they should be accountable. I do not believe that that is heavy handed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wondered what would be the right figure to put in. I am the first to accept that as regards any figure that is chosen someone will always say that it should be higher or lower. I believe that setting the level at £10,000 shows that we are erring on the generous side. About 70 per cent. of all registered charities are believed to have an annual income of less than £10,000. That means that with the figure in the Bill three out of four charities will be able to prepare a more simplified form of accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the threshold were to be raised to £25,000, as my noble friend Lord Mountgarret suggests, that would include a further 5 per cent. so that 75 per cent. of charities would be able to produce simpler accounts. Acceptance of the figure of £35,000 suggested by my noble friend Lord Swinfen would mean that about 80 per cent. of charities would be entitled to produce the simpler form of accounts. That is a very substantial number of charities which would be allowed to provide the simpler form of accounts. That is the reason why I believe that £10,000 is the right figure and even a generous one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must also remember that many of the smaller charities rely on endowments for their income. An endowed charity with an annual income of £35,000 or one with only £25,000, could be a fairly substantial undertaking with assets worth possibly £500,000. I do not believe that it is proper for a charity of that size to prepare accounts in the form which is suitable for very much smaller organisations. For example, the receipts of payments account would not show something as elementary as to whether a surplus or a deficit had resulted from the year's activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all those reasons I hope that the Committee will agree that at £10,000 we are allowing far simpler accounts to be produced by a very large proportion of charities. To make the figure higher would be unreasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Earl said that the number of charities with assets of half a million pounds produced very low income. If that were the case they would be very badly managed charities in any event. To my mind my noble friend's argument does not
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
change the principle behind this group of amendments. I hope that he will give some further consideration to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.15 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also hope that my noble friend will give a little further thought to this matter. I agree that it is very easy to argue about precise figures. What the Bill presently provides for those charities which do not have to produce full accounts will be adequate. I hope that my noble friend will be flexible enough to give the issue further thought. What my two noble friends have said is justified. Even if the Government decide not to go to the full £35,000 at least some move from the figure of £10,000 would be justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As regards what my noble friend Lord Ferrers has said we should bear in mind that under Clause 21(6)—and we find this dealt with elsewhere in the Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order amend subsection (3) above by substituting a different sum for the sum for the time being specified there".</p></blockquote>
If, in the light of inflation, which we hope will not occur as it has in the past, and in order to save the charities some costs in having accounts prepared the Secretary of State feels that a higher sum is desirable, then that can be done. Bearing in mind that there is that opportunity I support my noble friend on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem about the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is that if it is right to have a figure in excess of £10,000 it is right for this Committee to agree to a figure over that sum and not leave it to a future Secretary of State to reconsider the matter. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, rightly pointed out that this is basically an inflation subsection. Its purpose is that if in four or five years' time we have 20 per cent. inflation, or whatever the figure may be, the Secretary of State may increase the figure. It seems to me that the figure is unrealistically low at the moment. I do not believe that there is a vast gulf between us on the matter. I join with the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, in hoping that the noble Earl will reconsider the figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He began his speech by saying that he did not want to overburden trustees of the smaller charities and I am sure that we all agree with him. I fear that the consequence of having a figure of £10,000 is that it will overburden the trustees of smaller charities. At the end of this discussion I very much hope that the noble Earl will look at the matter again. I repeat that there is not a huge gulf between us. As he rightly said, almost any figure put in will be subject to argument that it should be higher or lower. I prefer the figure of £35,000. I would certainly settle for a lower figure if we could reach general agreement on the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the noble Earl responded to the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, he gave us an analysis of what the figures meant. In other words, 70 per cent. of the charities are exempt at £10,000; 75 per cent. will be exempt at £25,000 and 80 per cent. of the charities will be exempt at £35,000. What the noble Earl did not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
do—I expect he cannot—is say why exemption for 75 per cent. of the charities is a worse exemption ratio than 70 per cent. I do not know why the figure of £10,000 has been taken. Why should not 75 per cent. of smaller charities be exempt as opposed to 70 per cent.? In a sense it is a situation in which one has to have a figure and the Government have chosen £10,000 with very little justification put before the Committee for picking that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that situation I suggest that we should listen to what the charities themselves are saying about it. As the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, said, the figure of £10,000 has provoked intense discussion in the charities world and particularly in the Charity Finance Directors Group. Perhaps I may reiterate the point. Practically everyone concerned with that matter in the group took the view that £10,000 was not the right figure. They did not agree that £35,000 was right or that £50,000 or £25,000 was right. On the first point as to whether £10,000 is the right figure to choose, I understand that the almost unanimous view of the charities world is that it is not sufficient. In the absence of any justification for that figure, despite the very attractive analysis which came from the noble Earl, as it always does, the Government have to move away from that figure and then perhaps we can discuss what figure should be inserted in its place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is almost like a horse trading exercise. The Government have come forward with a figure and my noble friend Lord Peyton then said "I wonder whether the Government will think a little further about the figure and move up a little from £10,000 to a higher figure". The noble Lord, Lord Richard, then said that if £25,000 means that 75 per cent. of the charities are to be exonerated and £35,000 means that 80 per cent. will be exonerated, why is that so much worse than 70 per cent.? The noble Lord has fallen into a trap of his own making. We fixed a figure at £10,000 because 70 per cent. of the charities are to be released from the obligation. We believe that that is a very generous figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the principle. There has to be accountability. All those charities at the lower end of the spectrum will be removed from arduous accountability. The Committee is trying to remove from the more arduous accountability requirements those at the higher end of the lower part of the spectrum. That is not reasonable. What is it that the charities are being asked to do? Let us look at Clause 21. It provides:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The charity trustees of a charity shall…prepare in respect of each financial year … a statement of accounts complying"</p></blockquote>
with various requirements made by the Secretary of State. Subsection (3) requires that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where a charity's gross income in any financial year does not exceed £10,000, the charity trustees may, in respect of that year, elect to prepare … a receipts and payments account, and a statement of assets and liabilities".</p></blockquote>
That is not an arduous responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee chooses the figure of £35,000, it may be releasing from the obligation to provide a better form of accounts those charities which have substantial capital. We believe that the figure of £10,000 is the right one because by that we are
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
releasing a large proportion of charities from the heavier undertaking. I hope that the Committee will agree that that is a reasonable figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my noble friend sits down, will he tell the Committee from where he obtained his statistics? I understand that only 11 per cent. of charities submit their accounts. He has mentioned a statistic as high as 80 per cent. I am sure that he has good reason for that, but I do not understand from where his advisers produced the statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, would not endowed charities still have to produce a proper statement of assets and liabilities even if their income is low? It does not matter, in my view, as they would have to produce a proper receipts and payments account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Hilton of Eggardon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I assume that the requirements include the professional auditing of accounts, because, if so, the cost of having that done will form a considerable percentage of the £10,000 income? That seems unfair if one assumes that the professional auditing of accounts will cost several hundred pounds, which might amount to 5 per cent. of the charity's income. That is another proportion of the £10,000 exemption which should be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is precisely what the charities do not have to do. The clause releases them from that obligation. All that they have to do is to provide a receipts and payments account and a statement of their assets and liabilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Hilton of Eggardon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister will forgive me for saying so, those charities which come just above the £10,000 are the ones which will be required to provide professionally audited accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see what the noble Baroness means. She is correct. I think that my noble friend Lord Swinfen said that only 11 per cent. of charities produce accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not say that only 11 per cent. produced their accounts but that only 11 per cent. of charities submit their accounts to the Charity Commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole idea behind the Bill is that more people should do that. Many people do not, and we want to see that they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my noble friend's last statement, but it does not help him tell the Committee from where he obtains his statistics. The percentages that he has given are for all charities. All the cases that he mentioned come to considerably above 11 per cent.; so I do not understand how he arrives at those percentages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The statistics were obtained from a random survey of the register of charities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel some embarrassment in speaking as I am chairman of a local charity with assets of £350,000 and an income of about £23,000. We have never sent accounts to the Charity Commission. I share the noble Lord's puzzlement at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
how the Home Office has arrived at the figures. Having said all that, I have no serious quarrel with the figure of £10,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am unhappy and disappointed at my noble friend's reply. Bearing in mind the feeling that has been expressed by many Members of the Committee, and the horse trading to which he referred—the figures are open to some question, and I do not deny that—we were trying to see whether the principle might be taken on board. We were asking my noble friend to take the matter away to see whether a better figure could be inserted.

I am sure that I speak for my noble friends and supporters when I say that they will have an open mind with regard to any other reasonable figure suggested by the Government, because there is no doubt it is felt that an income of £10,000 a year is too low to justify the added increase in costs, not just for the production of the accounts. I noted that my noble friend said that the charities would have only to produce a receipts and payments account. I am afraid that that may not be so because the Bill provides that they will be submitted in a,
	<br><blockquote><p>"form and contents as may be prescribed … by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
That is a completely open-ended commitment. We do not know how many reams of paper may have to be filled in to produce the accounts. The principle is the same in relation to the other amendments that have been tabled in respect of annual reports and annual returns. The small charities are being treated like companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said before, for alms houses £10,000 a year is hardly sufficient to maintain and look after them properly and put something on one side for emergencies and large repair bills. I am disappointed that my noble friend is not prepared to take back the provision and reconsider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble friend Lord Renton drew attention to the fact that the Secretary of State could at any time alter the figure. I agree with him 100 per cent. It depends upon where one starts. If one starts at £10,000 an increase of, say, 50 per cent., which the Secretary of State will think is generous, will bring the figure to £15,000 only. The feeling of many members of the Committee is that if we started at £15,000 or £20,000 a 50 per cent. increase would be more realistic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my noble friend has realised that we are referring only to income. A smallish charity with an income of £10,000 only may well have capital of £200,000; and a charity with an income of £25,000, which is the higher figure that my noble friend suggests, may have capital of £500,000. We are then getting into a realm in which we should require better accounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There we go down a very difficult route. I agree with my noble friend entirely. A charity may well have capital assets exceeding £500,000. A set of alms houses on a desirable building site could well have enormous capital value but its income is not merely nothing; there is a deficit because
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
of the expenditure that has to be met. That argument does not hold water. I understand my noble friend's anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy. I had hoped that my noble friend the Minister would have agreed to take the points on board, taken the provision away and reconsidered it. I wonder whether we should test the feeling of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The noble Lord said: I shall not press the amendment but I wish to move it so that we can return to the matter later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the random survey which the noble Earl mentioned was carried out among 1,200 charities out of a total of 170,000. It is therefore not a very good sample. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may take this opportunity to say that the Amendments Nos. 42A and 48A have been grouped with Amendments Nos. 19A and 20 and the noble Viscount spoke to Amendment No. 42A, but it seems to me to raise a different point. I hope that it will not be shown in the next groupings list as having been already discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend Lord Swinfen referred to the survey. Approximately one in 80 charities was asked for details of its income. It was a random survey. My noble friend said that it was not a very large one, but no sample ever is and it would be unreasonable to expect the Charity Commissioners to go to even greater lengths to obtain that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, the groupings were made for the convenience of the Committee but if noble Lords wish to speak to any amendment individually they may do so. The fact that amendments are grouped together does not prevent noble Lords from doing so, but as far as possible if amendments are of a similar nature it is better to have one debate. However, I agree with the noble Lord that that particular amendment covers a slightly different matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the Question whether Clause 21 should stand part of the Bill perhaps I may mention Clauses 23, 24 and 27 so that we do not go into the matter again.

	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure my noble friend that the regulations are an important part of the results of the Bill.

	<p>Clause 22 [
	<i>Annual audit or examination of charity accounts</i>]:</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman of Committees (Lord Aberdare)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now call Amendment No. 22A. If this amendment is agreed to, I cannot call Amendments Nos. 23 to 25 inclusive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 22A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 19, line 41, leave out subsection (1) and insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("(1) Subsection (2) applies to a financial year of a charity if the charity's gross income or total expenditure in any of its preceding financial years (but not earlier than its last three financial years) exceeds £100,000.").</p></blockquote>
The noble and learned Lord said: I am not happy with the wording of subsection (1) of Clause 22. I do not think that it is user friendly. The purpose of the subsection is simple. If a charity's income or expenditure in any of the last three of its financial years is more than £100,000 the account must be audited in accordance with subsection (2). That result is achieved in the following way:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (2) applies to a financial year of a charity ('the relevant year') if the charity's gross income or total expenditure (or both) in any of the following, namely—

	<ol>

	<li>the relevant year,</li>

	<li>the financial year of the charity immediately preceding the relevant year (if any), and</li>

	<li>the financial year of the charity immediately preceding the year specified in paragraph (b) (if any), exceeds (or exceed) £100,000".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
All that is needed to achieve the intended result is what I suggest in Amendment No. 22A:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (2) [the audit subsection] applies to a financial year of a charity if the charity's gross income or total expenditure in any of its preceding financial years (but not earlier than its last three financial years) exceeds £100,000".</p></blockquote>
If worded in that way it is clear and any charity trustee can understand it. With respect, the Bill as drawn is difficult to follow. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to this amendment in the sense that it will produce a more
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
recognisable and understandable subsection (1) of the clause. However, if it is adopted in its present form we would not then be allowed to go on to discuss whether the right figure should be £100,000 or some larger figure. It seems therefore that what I was going to say on Amendment No. 25 I had better say now on Amendment No. 22A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 25, which will fall if this amendment is carried, seeks to leave out £100,000 and insert £200,000. It is rather like the debate we have just had on £10,000 or £25,000. What we do not have at the moment is any justification for the figure of £100,000. I hope that the noble Earl can give us one of his sparkling and illuminating statistical surveys. He will tell us no doubt what percentage of charities have an income of £100,000 and what percentage have an income of more than £100,000. But even when he has done that and has gone through all the figures it would be helpful if we could have some rationale behind the figure of £100,000 beyond the basis that one has to have a figure and that therefore £100,000 is as good a figure as any other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Doubts have been expressed in some parts of the charities world as to whether £100,000 is a correct figure. The Prison Reform Trust is worried that the figure should be as low as £100,000 and wishes to increase it. After all, the figure of £100,000 triggers some fairly onerous obligations on the part of the charity. One is talking about a full-scale professional audit. As we all know, that is an expensive procedure, and whether it is justified in terms of charities with and income of only £100,000 I beg leave to doubt. Therefore I should be grateful if the noble Earl could answer on Amendment No. 22A the questions I would have raised on Amendment No. 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my noble friend. I too was attracted by the noble and learned Lord's amendment because it makes the drafting clearer. Whenever in the past in my limited experience of your Lordships' House I have dared to question the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, on an issue of this kind he has come back at me and said that for arcane reasons which only the parliamentary draftsman could explain on threat of the rack the precise form in which the Bill is being presented is absolutely and unalterably necessary. This amendment is vastly clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be most grateful if the noble Earl could explain to the Committee why the precise form in which it is here stated is so utterly necessary when a much simpler and more straightforward version appears to the layman—the non-lawyer—to be so much more desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to support my noble friend Lord Richard on the issue of £200,000. Once again several preceding amendments have proposed raising figures from limits proposed in the Bill. I agree that it is not easy to fix a ceiling, but here again £100,000 seems depressingly low. The figure of £200,000 is not, so far as one can see, the result of any serious academic commissioned research. Perhaps it is the result of a survey similar to the one about which we heard in the previous debate. I agree that 1,200 out of 17,000 is a reasonable
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
statistical sample, but that is complicated by the fact that only 11 per cent. of charities submit accounts to the Charity Commission anyway. What correlation is there between those two sets of figures? I should be grateful for any help that could be given to us in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the charities that have made representations to me seem to feel that £100,000 is much too low. The degree of unanimity among them would seem to suggest that the experts—the people at the coal face—are distinctly worried about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my noble and learned friend that the drafting of this clause leaves a good deal to be desired. However, if his amendment were passed I would not be able to speak to my amendment, Amendment No. 24. At this stage I wish to make the point that I do not think that the amendment quite achieves the purpose intended. Under the Bill as drafted a charity has to meet these requirements on three successive years. I propose to argue that two would be enough. As the amendment is drafted, it could mean that, if a charity exceeded £100,000 in revenue as a result of an appeal three years back and then did not have anything in excess of £100,000 for the following financial years, it could still be caught. I do not think that that is desirable or is what is intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, for explaining his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, he is trying to achieve the same objectives we are trying to achieve but in a slightly different way. The noble and learned Lord thinks his is a simpler way. I think he will recognise his drafting is not 100 per cent. correct. The drafting of his amendment does not achieve what the noble and learned Lord seeks to achieve. I wish to reconsider the provision to see whether the drafting of the noble and learned Lord could be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say to the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, that the trustees will have 10 months after the end of a financial year in which to prepare their accounts and have them audited before sending them to the commissioners. That should be long enough even for a charity that only crosses the audit threshold on the last day of a financial year. In the White Paper we said we were considering the introduction of a formula to allow charities to predict which accounting requirements they would be subject to in any accounting year. We intended to introduce three different categories to determine the form and content of the accounts. For audit purposes we now have just the one dividing line. One is either over it or under it and which side one is on does not affect the form or the content of one's accounts, only the requirement for an audit. At present if one crosses a threshold in one year, one is obliged to have one's accounts audited for the three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lords, Lord Richard and Lord Morris, made some points. The noble Lord, Lord Richard, said he hoped I would come out with some sparkling statistics. I am glad he finds my statistics so helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said sparkle. I said I was glad the noble Lord found them so helpful. The noble Lord then got up and said he wanted me to sparkle. I assume that meant he did not want me to be helpful. I am trying to be helpful too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A highly qualified auditor will impose charges appropriate to his expertise. While the public want to know that a charity has had its accounts properly scrutinised each year there is a limit to the amount a charity should legitimately be expected to spend to secure this scrutiny. We have to compromise. In the White Paper we suggested an income level of £50,000 might be about right at which to draw the line between those charities required to have an audit and those not so required. We made a tentative reference to this figure in the hope we would receive the views of charities, the public or accountants. We received views from all those people and as a result we have set the figure at an income or expenditure level of £100,000. We thought that was the best compromise. I hope we do not get into the horse trading arena again, but I fear the noble Lord, Lord Richard, would like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that about eight out of every 100—this is my sparkling and helpful statistic—registered charities have an income or expenditure over £100,000. Therefore, the audit requirement will apply only to a small proportion of the total. As charities go, £100,000 is a substantial amount of money and we believe it is fully justifiable to expect a small percentage of that money to be spent on an annual audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To raise the figure to £200,000 might mean that only three or four charities out of each 100 had to have audits. That is on the low side. I hope that explanation will satisfy the noble Lord, Lord Richard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope someone will clarify for me, both in the amendment and in the original drafting of the Bill, the meaning of the expression "total expenditure". A charity may have little expenditure on its current account but may have considerable expenditure on its capital account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My simple answer is that total expenditure means total expenditure. Where one spends a large sum of money that is obviously the total.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Beaumont of Whitley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the noble Earl can clarify something for me. I hope that it is within his capabilities as my mind may be irredeemably muddled, although I do not think it is at the moment. Am I right in thinking that although the trigger figure which is decided on will entail the work of a more qualified auditor, it does not necessarily entail that that qualified auditor should be professionally paid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, it seems to me that to a certain extent this matter will sort itself out in practice at the lower figure because, in my experience, auditors are extremely generous in giving their services to charities. That does not just apply locally; they also go out of their areas to help charities which need assistance. Obviously there is a limit to that and the limit is imposed by the amount of work they have to do. If they do not have to do much work, they will give their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
services free to at least one charity. If they have to do a great deal of work, they will have to charge because that is their profession. Therefore, over the £100,000 limit there will be a natural sorting out. It is right that qualified persons should be involved but whether or not they charge for their services will depend on the complexity of the charity rather than a specific figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord is correct. The important point is that it should be a qualified audit carried out by a qualified person. Whether or not that person decides to charge is a matter for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following on that point, if he has to have a practising certificate I assume he could not be retired. Therefore, a retired person could not carry out that duty. Is that right or wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The noble Lord said: I find the inclusion of those words, which appear rather coyly and apologetically in brackets, extremely puzzling. If a charity's gross income exceeds £100,000 it is caught, if its total expenditure exceeds £100,000 it is caught. What do those additional words mean?

The noble Lord said: The noble Earl was good enough to answer this amendment before the case for it had been deployed. It is an amendment on which the Charity Finance Directors' Group and the NCVO feel very strongly. Once again it relates to what is practical in the world with which we are dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Selecting the correct auditor and arranging for the services of an auditor to be given at a reasonable cost, which is particularly important, can take time. The time limit to which the noble Earl referred may not be sufficient. For many charities it is relatively easy to forecast total expenditure but not nearly so easy to forecast total income. It is easy to envisage a situation

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment because of my experience of working with a fund-raising charity. The charity for which I work is able to budget for its expenditure in advance but it is extremely difficult to forecast what income it expects. I know that our director of finance puts a notional forecast on legacy income. I do not know how he does that. It is never accurate. Sometimes I think he is tempted to go round with a shillelagh after some wealthy supporters to make certain his forecast comes out right. However, it is terribly difficult to forecast income when relying on other peoples' charity. I strongly support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand subsection (1) as requiring any forecasting whatever. I had understood that charity trustees would look at their accounts at the close of a financial year and if, at the close of that year or in the preceding year or in the year before that, income or expenditure exceeded £100,000 an audit was needed. However, no forecasting of any description is necessary as I understand the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brightman, is correct. There is no need to forecast. The whole point of the provision is so that in any year where a charity's income exceeds £100,000 it will be necessary to have the accounts audited. There is a 10 months' delay for that to be done. On the assumption that the accounts end on 31st December and during that year the charity's income has risen to over £100,000, then it will be necessary to have the accounts audited before 10 months afterwards; in other words, at the end of October. That is not an unreasonable provision. I accept that charities' incomes rise and fall. Periodically, a charity may receive a windfall. If there is such a windfall of, perhaps, £250,000 and the charity's income has been increased by that, it is right that there should be a proper auditing of accounts in that year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What damage would be done were the amendment to be agreed to? The noble Earl has not dealt with that. What does it matter? The Charity Finance Directors' Group and the NCVO believe that the requirement should come into effect the year after the limit is exceeded. The noble Earl is being rather stubborn on this point. I find it difficult to see how the public interest can be damaged in any way whatever were the amendment to be carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is not of £25,000 or £100,000 or £200,000 suddenly arriving on the last day of the year but the problem of a relatively small sum arriving on the last day of the year. The charity is then driven into
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
a situation in which it must carry out a full-scale professional audit. I hope that the noble Earl will indicate that he is flexible about this matter. I can understand the position he adopted during our debate on other amendments this morning, but I cannot understand why he is so hostile to this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The adjectives of the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, are flowing as thick and fast as those of my noble friend Lord Peyton. He accused me of being stubborn and hostile. I do not wish to be either of those things. The noble Lord, Lord Harris, might be getting the bit between his teeth—if we can return to the horse metaphor—in suggesting that we might keep dividing on this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason why that paragraph is necessary is that, if it were deleted, it might mean that a charity's audit could be delayed for 22 months, because it refers to the relevant year. That would be undesirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the noble Earl will recognise that 22 months is a low figure. We are talking about a year and a charity which may get a marginal increase unexpectedly right at the end of the year. It may then be driven into a full-scale professional audit. That would drive the charity into a deficit situation. That is not reasonable. I repeat that I do not believe that the public interest can be damaged in any way were this amendment to be carried. The matter is in the hands of the noble Lord, Lord Allen, and I am sure that he will have something to say about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord, Lord Harris, must have been eating oats or something because he has got himself so worked up about these matters. I can explain to him that there is a very good reason, which is not a bogus one. The charities already have 10 months in which to produce their accounts if they find that during the year they have received a windfall. If this amendment were to be approved that would give them another 12 months. Ten months plus 12 months equals 22 months, and that is not bogus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fact the charities submit accounts every 12 months and that is why the figure given by the noble Earl is bogus.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should consider the forecast, which has become confused in our discussions. I believe that the Charity Finance Directors Group was concerned not with the legal necessity to forecast in any way but with the fact that audits are expensive. If at the last moment a large donation is received, it is impossible to forecast the amount that will have to be paid out for that audit. That makes it all the more difficult for a charity director to run his charity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may add one small point to that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend said that only yesterday I described him as being stubborn and hostile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I must correct my noble friend. Those charming adjectives came from the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich. They would have never have come from my noble friend Lord Peyton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my noble friend. I have searched the 
	<i>Official Report</i> through a mist of tears to find such words coming from my mouth. I have not found them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to my noble friend Lord Peyton for suggesting that he used such adjectives. It was the noble Lord, Lord Harris. I have noticed an enormous change in my noble friend Lord Peyton, who has been extremely helpful today. I commend him for that and I hope that he continues in that way. I also commend that course of conduct to the noble Lord, Lord Harris.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the noble Earl continues like that he may drive the noble Lord, Lord Peyton, into a rather different form of conduct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may follow on from what the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris, said. A charity may well receive a windfall at the end of the year. However, as the Minister will know, if that windfall donation is given to be used by the charity for a specific purpose, it is a breach of trust to use it for any other purpose such as paying the auditors' fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that a charity has its finances tied up extremely tightly as regards expenditure. It is very easy for a charity within the fund-raising field to raise for specific objects. It is extremely difficult to raise money for general administration. Those who give to charities like to see where their money is going. They like to see the bricks and mortar and the care that is given by charities. They do not like their donations to be used on general office administrative expenditure. I know that that is necessary, but that is something that should be taken into account when considering this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the auditors' fees do not enter into the picture at all. They are expenditure in the following year and not in the year we are dealing with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In any year for which an audit was required, although the account of the auditors may be paid in the subsequent year, the fee would appear in the accounts of the year to which the audit referred. I understand the problem which my noble friend Lord Swinfen has set out. I realise that charities receive money for specific projects. He quite rightly said that people want to see their money going where they want it to go. That is precisely the reason for having an audit. When these large sums are reached, people have the right to know that trustees are doing their work properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, but it would be a breach of trust if money given for a specific object was used for another purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>108</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but that does not mean that those are the only funds which the charity has. When a charity has increased funds somehow or other it should be able to pay for an audit. I find it difficult to understand that a charity which is in receipt of such funds would be unable to find the money for an audit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must have caused some misunderstanding because of the incompetent way in which I moved the amendment. When I spoke about forecasts I meant that when trustees were happily planning their year they did not take account of the fact that at the very end of that year they might suddenly receive a donation which put them over the limit. Although the noble Earl speaks of 10 months as though it is an eternity, by the time the scattered trustees have gathered themselves together and tried to find an auditor at a fee which they can afford to pay, 10 months will have soon have gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Harris, that to wait another year is not going to be to the public detriment, particularly when one considers that for the past 30 or 40 years there has not been any requirement of this kind at all. But opinion is obviously divided on the Committee. I must take the amendment away and think about it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> had given notice of his intention to move Amendment No. 25:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 20, line 5, leave out ("£100,000") and insert ("£200,000").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: I believe that this amendment was discussed sufficiently earlier. I do not move it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[
	<i>Amendment No. 25 not moved.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 26:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 20, line 20, after ("charity,") insert ("but gross income or total expenditure of that charity falls in the range of £35,001, to £100,000,").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This amendment and Amendment No. 29 seek to limit the mandatory independent examination or audit of charities whose gross income or total expenditure exceeds £35,000 as regards the amendment. As the Bill is drafted and with the withdrawal of Amendment No. 19, it should be £10,000. At a later stage I shall have to return with a revised figure. It is sought to define more precisely the third income band than does the current Bill. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the regime proposed in the Bill is that the accounts of charities of all sizes should be independently scrutinised annually, the larger ones by undergoing a professional audit and the smaller ones, if they do not wish to opt for a professional audit, by undergoing an examination by an independent person. My noble friend's amendment questions, however, whether charities with an income under £35,000 should have any form of independent scrutiny at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put the matter in a nutshell, my noble friend proposes to allow 80 per cent. of all charities to decide for themselves whether they should submit their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>109</span>
accounts to scrutiny unless the commissioners order the accounts to be professionally audited or recommend that they should be independently examined. That is the rough proportion of charities—and it is a statistic which I know the noble Lord, Lord Richard, will find attractive—and it relates to charities with an income of less than £35,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commissioners' recommendations proposed by my noble friend do not appear to be binding or enforceable and could be ignored. They would be ignored by those who have something in their accounts to hide. That would undermine the basis for requiring charities' accounts to be independently scrutinised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system for independent examination that we have devised is deliberately flexible so that the calibre of the examiner and the depth of the examination can be matched to the size and complexity of different charities. The commissioners' guidance and directions, which will be given under Clause 22(7), will address that matter. In addition, we shall give the commissioners power to give guidance and directions which apply to single charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot go much further in trying to cater for individual needs. We must remember the principle that no charity, however small, can avoid some form of independent scrutiny of the accounts each year to ensure that they are correct and that the trustees are carrying out their work with integrity. That is fundamental if the supervisory framework created by the Bill is to be able to prevent abuse or mismanagement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend has said a great deal. I will read what he has said in the 
	<i>Official Report.</i> I may come back at a later stage. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 27:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 20, line 15, leave out ("be qualified by his ability in, and practical experience of, the practice of accountancy") and insert ("have sufficient expertise").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is an amendment about which I feel strongly. It is supported by the Charity Finance Directors Group and the NCVO. The Bill's wording, on independent examination, goes a good deal further than the wording suggested in the White Paper. I am not sure why that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill implies that an independent examination must be carried out by professional accountants or auditors. It unreasonably restricts the ability of charities to seek and obtain independent examination from a range of low-cost but qualified sources, such as retired bank managers. That is what the White Paper envisaged, and that seems to me to be acceptable. The amendment is designed to bring the Bill into line with what was proposed in the White Paper. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is grouped with Amendment No. 28, which I have tabled. I am happy with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Allen, and I support it. As I read the Bill, it means that
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
an independent examiner has to be a professional auditor. I doubt whether that is my noble friend's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I were to give my ignorant reading of this matter. As I read it first, I gained the impression that importance was attached to the word "qualified" rather than to the word "ability". I subsequently saw that I was misreading the provision. "Qualified by his ability" does not necessarily imply a professional qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So many people have been misled in the same way that it would be an enormous help if the Minister could take it away and clarify it in some way. "To have sufficient experience in" may not be the best form of words, but I am sure that the phraseology in the Bill could be improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that there is anything between us in what is intended. The definition of an independent examiner that we have proposed is not intended to prescribe a practising accountant, nor would it have that effect. An independent examiner must obviously be competent for the task that he is to do and he must be familiar with accounting methods, but he need not be a practising accountant. We have in mind the people mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, such as bank or building society managers, local authority treasurers or retired accountants. They would all be suitable as independent examiners. Our definition would allow such people to do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 22(7) the commissioners will be able to give guidance to charity trustees about the selection of a person as an independent examiner. The guidance will steer trustees in the direction of people such as those I have mentioned. The commissioners will obviously want to consult reasonably widely before issuing the guidance. I am sure that many other classes of people will be found to be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord, Lord Allen, need not be worried that the provision would exclude people such as bank managers and retired accountants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what my noble friend said, perhaps he would make one point clear. I assume that he is referring to people who have expertise without being qualified and members, for example, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Society of Incorporated Accountants and other bodies mentioned in Clause 8(3) of the 1960 Act which is to remain part of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Bill, and in the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, the expression "the practice of accountancy" is used. That could be misleading as meaning that the person has to be a practising accountant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not in my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, it is in the Bill. That is my mistake. I apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may gently come back to the noble Earl. From the contributions that have been made this morning I should have thought that it was clear that several Members of the Committee think that the words as set out in the Bill are capable of being construed in a way which the Government clearly did not intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possible ambiguity by the use of the word "qualified" followed by words such as "practical experience of, the practice of accountancy". That can raise question marks and might cause some confusion. I cannot for the life of me understand why the Minister cannot accept that argument and re-draft the provision in accordance with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, which clarifies what the Government say they intend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not read the clause in that way. It is clear that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"practical experience of, the practice of accountancy"</p></blockquote>
means someone who has a great deal of experience of the practice of accountancy as a receiver of that service; for instance, a bank manager. It is a correct principle to have in the Bill that the person does not have to be a practising accountant. I speak as an accountant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has not so far been pointed out about the amendment is that the words "have sufficient expertise" are dangerous, because if during such a person's examination of the accounts and records of a charity he manifestly demonstrates that he does not have the sufficient expertise he could put the trustees in great danger of not having appointed someone with sufficient expertise and that could put them in breach of trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount St. Davids</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble friend the Minister has said that some 70 per cent. of charitable trusts have a budget which would not exceed that of most household budgets. Would a good housewife who could manage a budget of £10,000 have sufficient expertise to audit the accounts of the local girl guide group?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the last point, if a charity was very small, all that would be necessary would be to go to somebody in the locality such as a bank manager and ask him to examine the accounts. He would probably make no charge. It is correct that people do not have to be qualified to examine accounts but they have to be qualified to undertake an audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is concerned whether the wording in the Bill achieves what is intended. We all want the same thing and I shall consider the matter again to see whether the present wording achieves that or whether we can find better wording.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am relieved to discover that we do all intend the same thing. In the light of recent experience of banks, I am surprised that a bank manager should be regarded as having experience in the practice of accountancy. Some of them manage to hide their experience rather successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
It is not just Members of the Committee who have misunderstood what is intended. The wording has given rise to misapprehension and misunderstanding over a wide area. I am not sure that it is adequate if in due course the Charity Commission issues guidance under subsection (7) saying that subsection (3) does not mean what it appears to mean on the face of it. Therefore I hope that the Minister will seriously consider the wording. At the end of the day it is a drafting exercise. With that assurance, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> had given notice of his intention to move Amendment No. 28:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 20, line 25, leave out from beginning to ("or") in line 26 and insert ("have the ability to carry out the examination and to be experienced in accountancy matters,").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: Accepting the undertaking of my noble friend Lord Ferrers to the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, I shall not move the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[
	<i>Amendment No. 28 not moved.</i>]</p>

	<p>[
	<i>Amendment No. 28A had been withdrawn from the Marshalled List.</i>]</p>

	<p>[
	<i>Amendment No. 29 not moved.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 29A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 20, line 39, leave out paragraphs (a) and (b) and insert:

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>("(a) from the funds of the charity; or</li>

	<li>(b) to the extent that it appears to the Commissioners not to be practical to seek recovery of those expenses in accordance with paragraph (a) above or, that the trustees have unreasonably failed to comply with an order under subsection (4) above, from the charity trustees.").</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: This is another aspect of the Bill in which penalties on trustees seem to be unduly high. The amendment would make the charity rather than the trustees liable in the first instance, as it would have been had the audit been carried out at the correct time. It also introduces the safeguard about having "unreasonably failed" to comply. There may be reasonable reasons why a charity's trustees have not carried out their independent review within the 10-month period about which we have heard so much. The Bill ought to make it possible for the Charity Commissioners to take those considerations into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment retains the concept of trustee liability where the charity does not have the funds to meet the cost of such an audit. This is another amendment which is supported by the Charity Finance Directors Group and the NCVO. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, enables me to ask whether, under the Bill as it stands or under the noble Lord's amendment, it would be correct in law to say that the charity trustees—although under the Bill they are to be held personally liable jointly and severally for those expenses—having paid the expenses can reclaim the money from the charity itself, assuming that the expenses were legitimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
Under the amendment it would appear that the charity's trustees would still have a personal liability, although the amendment does not say so. I therefore tend to the view that if that is what is intended we should keep the words in the Bill. It is a somewhat perplexing position when we consider whether ultimately the charity's trustees could reclaim any expenses they have been ordered to pay or have paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My amendments, Amendments Nos. 30 and 32 which are grouped with Amendment No. 29A, cover the point which my noble friend Lord Renton made. They are designed to make the charity liable in the first instance and the trustees of that charity liable only when the charity does not have the funds. One has to remember that trustees in the larger charities are responsible for the general policy of that charity and do not undertake the day-to-day running of the charity. It would be the paid officers who would, and should, be responsible for the audit being carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Morris of Castle Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was worried by the wording in the paragraph and I commend to the Committee the amendment as it stands. Many years ago as a much younger man I went along to a lawyer—although I try to keep out of their clutches as much as possible—in order to ask whether I would be well advised to act as a trustee for some charity or other. An ancient lawyer in the city of York regarded me with a baleful eye and said, "Young man, the law knows no higher status than that of a trustee". That struck terror into my heart. I know not whether it be true or not. At the time I was made aware of the enormous responsibility I was being asked to take on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who act as trustees take on great responsibilities. It would discourage people from coming forward to take on the job of trustee, particularly of small charities, which they do perhaps without full knowledge of the status of the very word "trustee", if they were to be faced with demands of that kind. Would it not be kinder and more productive in the bringing forth of new trustees if the wording of the amendment, which is gentler than the wording of the Bill, were to be agreed to?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Mottistone</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what Members of the Committee have said in speaking to the amendments. Amendments Nos. 30 and 32 in the name of my noble friend Lord Swinfen are preferable to those of the noble Lord, Lord Allen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The commissioners are empowered by the Bill in certain circumstances to order that the accounts of a charity be audited by a professional auditor and to recover the expenses of the audit, including the auditor's remuneration, from the trustees personally where the commissioners have appointed the auditor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have considered very carefully in what circumstances the commissioners should be able to recover the costs of an audit ordered by the commissioners from the trustees personally. Perhaps I may set out the circumstances in which the commissioners may require an audit: first, where the charity is already required in the ordinary course of
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
events to have its accounts audited but has failed to do so within 10 months of the financial year end; secondly, where the accounts should have been independently examined but that has not been done within 10 months of the year end; and, thirdly, where the commissioners believe that it is desirable that the accounts of the charity should be audited even though there is no statutory requirement for that to be done but where, for example, they believe something is amiss with the charity's affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first and second of those three circumstances the expenses of the audit ordered by the commissioners shall be recoverable from the trustees personally and then, if that does not appear practicable, from the charity's funds. It is right that the trustees should be personally liable in these circumstances as in each case the commissioners will only have had to appoint an auditor because the trustees had themselves failed to have their accounts scrutinised within the prescribed time limit. In other words, the trustees must have committed a statutory default. It would, in my view, be wholly wrong to attack funds of the charity in these circumstances where the trustees are at fault because they have not carried out their statutory duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third case will arise where the commissioners have some reason to think that an audit is necessary even though the trustees are not in default of their duty to have their accounts independently examined. In this instance the commissioners' order will require that the charity's accounts be audited. If in response the trustees appoint an auditor they will not be personally liable for the expenses of the audit, but if the trustees do not appoint an auditor then they will be in default. We think it right in such circumstances that they should meet the costs personally of the audit required by the Charity Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much sympathise with the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Castle Morris. It can be a daunting task. However, it is important that trustees understand their obligations. It is as important for their own protection as it is for the protection of the charity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am convinced by my noble friend's explanation but I wonder whether he can confirm something which arises from a point I made earlier. It would seem to follow from what he has said that when trustees are personally liable having been in default it would be wrong for them—indeed the law would not allow them—to reclaim those expenses from the charity itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I understand that would be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Hilton of Eggardon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was concerned by the punitive tone of the noble Viscount's explanation of why this is being applied. The suggestion that in some ways trustees are delinquents who need to be punished in some fashion seemed to be the primary tone of what he was saying. Trustees need to be encouraged. There will be a great problem if trustees feel that the attitude of the Charity Commissioners is

	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
one of attack and punishment rather than one of support and help. I therefore support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the position if officers of a charity have been wilfully negligent or, as I know is happening in a case at the moment, if the only officer of a charity is ill and through his illness is not performing his duties? That could be unfair on the trustees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may say in reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton, that I was describing the position where trustees are in default. We want to encourage people to be trustees of charities. The provision applies only where the trustees are in default. My noble friend Lord Swinfen referred to a case. In any circumstances the commissioners will have to look at what is reasonable and what is unreasonably. The commissioners are fair-minded people. I am sure that the circumstances described by my noble friend would be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment under consideration covers the situation in which the trustees have unreasonably failed to comply with an order. I go along with the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton of Eggardon, that we are piling up in this Bill responsibilities of trustees. If we are not careful we shall end up not being able to find anyone willing to take on those responsibilities. Yesterday we were subjecting them to a new threat of criminal sanctions. Today we are threatening them with financial sanctions. I am most unhappy about that. I wonder whether I should test the feeling of the Committee. On the whole I think I should. I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Mottistone, prefers an alternative way, but I am also conscious of the fact that were the amendment to succeed the Government would want to redraft it anyway. I should like to test the feeling of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>On Question, Whether Clause 22 shall stand part of the Bill?</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given notice to my noble friends on the notional Front Bench that I wish on this clause stand part debate to obtain clarification and indeed an assurance as to the position of those companies which are charities or have charitable purposes. I do so mainly because, no doubt like other Members of the Committee, I have had an interesting memorandum sent to me by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales which states at paragraph 3:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our main concern with the Bill is that, as it is presently drafted, none of the accounting or auditing requirements will apply to charities which are established as companies. Such an omission will seriously reduce the effectiveness of the Bill and far from improving the accountability of charities, it may indeed reduce it".</p></blockquote>
With respect to the institute, I do not think it has that right. It is quite clear from the 1960 Act—that Act is not being altered in this way—that a charity means any institution, corporate or not, which is established for charitable purposes and is subject to the control of the High Court in the exercise of the court's jurisdiction with respect to charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that Act, and indeed in this Bill, we find references to corporate liability. However, I can shorten this by simply putting to my noble friend the simple question whether he will give an assurance that companies which are charities or have charitable purposes will be bound not only by the Companies Acts but also by this Bill. If I could have that assurance, a great deal of clarification will have been given. It is for consideration whether any further amendment to the Bill is needed in order to establish that, but I quite frankly doubt whether it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend for having given me notice of the fact that he was going to raise this matter. He wanted to know whether charitable companies have to provide accounts—I think that was his first question—and whether they are bound by the Bill. The answer is yes to both those questions. Charitable companies are though excluded in the Bill from the accounts and auditing requirements in Clauses 20 to 23. All companies have to prepare accounts and they have to have them professionally audited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Charitable companies are caught by the provisions of Clauses 24 to 27 regarding the submission of accounts and annual reports to the Charity Commissioners and also by the requirements to supply copies of their accounts to members of the public. The accounts of charitable companies which are prepared under the Companies Act regime are acceptable for the commission's purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Renton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my noble friend for that answer. I think it rather points to the need to have another look at subsection (9) of Clause 22 which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing is this section applies to a charity which is a company; but section 8(3) to (6) of the 1960 Act",</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
gives the commissioners the power to require the accounts of a charity to be investigated and audited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would seem to be an unnecessary contradiction here. I must say that I think the assurance my noble friend has given is helpful, but we do not want any confusion to arise from the terms of subsection (9) of Clause 22.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 22 agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 23 [
	<i>Supplementary provisions relating to audits etc.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 35:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 21, line 12, leave out sub-paragraph (iii).</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment I wish to speak also to Amendments Nos. 36, 39 and 40. Amendment No. 35 seeks to remove paragraph (iii) of Clause 23(1) (a). The amendment seeks to remove the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the certification by him of the audit".</p></blockquote>
I am advised that the use of those words is out of date as an audit is not certified. It is, however, necessary for the regulations to specify to whom the auditor or independent examiner is to report and the form of that report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the document 
	<i>Auditing and Reporting</i> produced by the Institute of Chartered Accountants, paragraph 11 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An examination of information will normally enable an accountant to form an opinion as to its reasonableness, but it will rarely enable him to 
	<i>certify</i> the information. Consequently the word 
	<i>certificate</i> is rarely an appropriate title for an accountant's report. The words 
	<i>certify</i> and 
	<i>certificate</i> both imply a high degree of factual certainty which an examination of records cannot normally provide. The words can only be used in relation to matters of which the accountant has or can obtain first hand knowledge. For example, he can certify that, according to the records of his client, a certain amount of money has been paid and he can certify that the figure of sales shown in his client's accounting records is £X because he can verify these facts at first hand by examining the accounting records. He cannot, however, certify or confirm the accuracy of his client's accounting records, financial statements or information extracted therefrom, because he cannot be sure that he has access to all the facts behind them: for instance … he cannot be sure that all sales have been recorded. Moreover, the records themselves may reflect apportionments and allocations which are matters of interpretation and judgement rather than of fact".</p></blockquote>
I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I explain what we have in mind as the problem to which my noble friend refers arises because of confusion between a certificate and a report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The certificate will relate to the auditor's or to the independent examiner's performance of his own functions and not to the accounts themselves. The auditor or the examiner will not be required to certify as to the correctness of the figures in the accounts. That would be to impose an inappropriate task upon him. He will certify that he has performed the audit or, as appropriate, the independent examination. The auditor's report will contain his comments on the accounts. Both the form of the report on the accounts and the certification of the audit or the examination will be prescribed by regulations which will make it clear what is required in each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
Therefore, the certificate merely states, "This work has been done". It does not include the report. The Institute of Chartered Accountants has been in discussion with the commissioners about what the report and certification will entail. We envisage wide consultations with charities, professional bodies and others before regulations are made or directions issued. We are anxious to get these matters right and I am grateful to my noble friend for drawing attention to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of audit and auditors is familiar. Independent examination is new in this context. It is right that an independent examiner should, in the way that I mentioned, certify that he has performed the examination. However, such examiners should not be required to make a report on that examination, much less to prepare one in a form prescribed in legislation. The concept of an independent examination is designed in order to lessen the burden on small charities of the independent scrutiny of their accounts. It would contradict the idea behind independent examination if the examiner, who may well be the local bank manager, were required also to report on his examination in a prescribed form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some independent examiners may wish to make a report on their examination. There is nothing to prevent them doing that. The commissioners are empowered under Clause 22(7) (b) to give general directions to charities with regard to the conduct of such examinations. They will also be able to make more specific directions in respect of a particular charity or charities where they think fit or in response to requests for advice from charities. That may well consist of guidance in the preparation of a report of an examination. I hope that that explanation assuages the anxieties of my noble friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my noble friend for that response which I shall read with care. My tiny brain finds it difficult to take it all in. I hope that I shall not return to this matter at a later state. At present, I doubt that. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment No. 36 not moved.</i>]</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount St. Davids</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 36A:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 21, line 24, after ("charity") insert ("or class of charities").</p></blockquote>
The noble Viscount said: I suggested to the Whips Office that this amendment should be grouped with Amendments Nos. 101A, 102A and 103A. That has not been done, perhaps in order to prevent me walking into a minefield through my lack of knowledge of the procedures of the Committee. However, I do ask that those amendments are considered together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, national organisations which act as umbrellas for a multitude of small charities operating at local levels have been given exemptions and exceptions to similar sections of the Act at present in force. Under those exceptions, the local charities have gained exceptions without making individual applications to the Charity Commissioners. I seek to continue the availability of such exceptions under the proposed legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
I take a worst case example under Clause 70, to which the three other amendments apply. Should the Girl Guides and Scouts wish to celebrate the birth of Lord Baden Powell by a fund raising exercise, applications for orders under Clause 70 would run into tens of thousands. I seek to bring about a procedure whereby the two headquarter organisations could ask for orders on behalf of the local entities. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment would extend the Charity Commissioner's power to dispense with either the requirement that a charity's accounts should be professionally audited, or that they be independently examined, or both. As drafted, Clause 23 allows the commissioners to dispense with those requirements in the case of any individual charity, or in the case of a particular year of that charity in circumstances which will be specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. For example, that may be if the income of the charity in question is very small in the year in question or if other circumstances make it inappropriate for the charity's accounts to be independently scrutinised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to see what extra would be gained by the additional words proposed in my noble friend's amendment. If it is designed to allow the commissioners to dispense with the requirements for independent scrutiny for the accounts Of a particular category of charity—for example, educational charities—the amendment is unacceptable. It is our view that all charities should be equally accountable to the public and to the Commissioners for the use of their funds, and the independent scrutiny of a charity's accounts are a central element in that accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my noble friend has it in mind that the commissioners may dispense with the requirements for independent scrutiny in the case of charities with a particular level of income, the same considerations apply. It is our view that, whatever the income of a charity, it is right and proper that its accounts should be subject to independent scrutiny, whether that is a professional audit or an independent examination.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount St. Davids</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure about the procedure, but I have grouped this amendment with Amendments Nos. 101A, 102A and 103A. Even if my noble friend will not allow it in this case, the principle is that where exceptions are given they can be given to a class of charity to stop a multitude of ramifications concerning charities at local level. I can well understand if my noble friend does not allow my suggestion at this stage because it applies to matters of accountancy. I have also asked to include in the group the matters raised in Clause 70 concerning fundraising where no such principle of accountancy applies. Will the noble Earl consider my suggestion in that regard?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that my noble friend suggested the grouping of these amendments. We found that they were sufficiently diverse to decide that grouping

	<p>Clause 24 [
	<i>Annual reports</i>]:</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 37:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 21, line 40, after ("activities") insert ("in pursuit of their charitable objects").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: Even more than most, this amendment is designed to be helpful to the Government. I am suggesting that it would be helpful to include on the face of the Bill a stronger reference to the fact that the Government would wish narrative annual reports to illustrate, as the White Paper puts it,
	<br><blockquote><p>"The means to promote the charity's object in the year under review".</p></blockquote>
That is the intention of the amendment through adding to the clause the words shown. It would ensure that the regulations specifically cover this point and would make the reports more interesting to the public and also encourage accountability. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, for putting down what he describes as a helpful amendment. That is always encouraging. It is obviously important to ensure that trustees' reports refer to the charity's objects and clearly explain how the trustees have gone about pursuing their objects during the course of the year. However, the regulations to be made by the Secretary of State under Clause 24(1) which will prescribe the information to be contained in an annual report will make that clear. Trustees have to be in no doubt that it is the manner in which the charitable objects have been pursued during the year that the public and the commissioners will be primarily interested in. These reports will be used by members of the public for assessing how a charity has performed. It is in the trustees' own interests that they should clearly show how they have performed in relation to their objects. The regulations will make that quite plain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that we should limit the matters on which the trustees report to activities in relation to their objects alone. We want the trustees to be able to give a full account of their activities during the course of the year. It would be an account which would also include any ancillary activities which they might have undertaken such as the investment of charity funds. The investment of funds is an important matter which should be reported on by the trustees. That is the reason why we prefer to keep the wording of the Bill as it is and not to include the words of the noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, which would be more restrictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->

	<br><blockquote><p>("() Nothing in this section shall apply to a charity the gross income of which in its last financial year did not exceed £25,000.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>() The Secretary of State may by order amend the above subsection by substituting a different sum for the sum being specified there.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: Speaking out of ignorance, I would like to know how this clause bites on the charities with an income of less than £1,000 a year which are not required to register. There are powers written in subsection (2) which enable the commissioners to dispense with the requirements contained in subsection (1) (b) but not in subsection (1) (a). I wish to know how the Government contemplate the requirements set out in this clause will bite on the very small charities, if at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Irrespective of the size of the charities, it is essential that they provide accounts and that they are looked at by an independent person. Therefore, this clause bites on the smaller charities in the same way as it bites on the larger ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little surprised by that answer. There are charities in existence with an income of £5 a year. Is the whole paraphernalia set out in the Bill to apply to those charities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there is a situation of that kind, the charity simply has to indicate that it has an income of £5, which can be done on a piece of paper. It can be certified by the local bank manager, who will charge nothing. No one else is to know that the income is £5 only. It might be £500.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Allen of Abbeydale</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Charity Commissioners will be deluged by a great many unnecessary reports.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may give the noble Lord a simile which he may well remember from the days when he occupied an exalted position in the Home Office. An awful lot of paper flew around the place and
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
does so even as regards a Bill of this kind. Only one or two bits are used. The same applies to the Charity Commissioners. Of course a great number of reports and accounts will come in because they have to be submitted. Many of them may not have to be scrutinised, but the fact is that they all have to be submitted so that they can be scrutinised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to intervene in a private dispute, but the last response of the noble Earl is absolutely staggering. Impositions are being made by this Bill on charities. Some form of accounts have to be sent in whether they are audited or whether it is a payments or a receipts account. In addition, an annual report has to be put in even if the income is as low as £2. Then we are told that this mass of paper will come in, but the Charity Commissioners will not bother with it except for one or two bits and pieces which they believe are important. How on earth are they to know what is important unless it is looked at? To impose these obligations on charities in one breath and then to say that it does not really matter because no one will bother to look at the reports and accounts makes nonsense of the whole Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p>Clause 24 agreed to.</p>

	<p>Clause 25 [
	<i>Special provision as respects accounts and annual reports of exempt and other excepted charities</i>]:</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> moved Amendment No. 43:
	<br><blockquote><p>Page 22, line 38, leave out subsections (1) and (2) and insert:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>("(1) Any exempt charity and any charity excepted by section 4(4) of the 1960 Act (charities not required to be registered) shall not have to comply with sections 20 to 23 or (except in accordance with subsection (5) below) section 24.").</p></blockquote>
The noble Lord said: The amendment gives us an opportunity to cover the ground once again. To avoid us all having the misfortune of making the same speech twice, or more than twice, it might be convenient for the Committee to take Amendment No. 47 at the same time because the amendments cover similar ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill is drafted, and as we are by now all well aware, even the smallest charities, whether or not they are registered, will have to comply with the accounting requirements introduced by Clauses 20 to 24.
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
Although we have already discussed those issues, I believe it is desirable to emphasise the points once again. Under Clause 21, charities with an income of less than £10,000 can prepare a simplified form of accounts; and under Clause 22 charities with an income of less than £100,000 can have an independent examination rather than a professional audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However in my view—this is one of the issues dealt with by the amendment—even those reduced obligations will be too high for the smallest charities. We are talking about charities which may have an income of £200 or £300 a year or even £40 or £50 a year. Many of those charities would find it burdensome to comply with the new requirements and, in particular, with the requirement to have an independent examination. That seems to be unnecessary for charities of that size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide that charities with an income of less than £1,000, which are not required to register, would not be subject to the new accounting regime. They would of course still be subject to the duty to keep accounts under Section 32 of the 1960 Act. The Charity Commissioners would still be able to require such a charity to produce a trustees' report under Clause 23(3). In this case the accounts would be in the simplified form permitted by Section 32 of the 1960 Act. That sufficiently protects the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would apply not just to the charities which have not registered because of the new £1,000 limit but to those which have registered voluntarily but have an income below that level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is for the convenience of the Committee I shall deal with Amendment No. 47 because it is desirable to try to make some progress given the formidable number of amendments still to be considered. The amendment deals with an allied situation: small charities which are not required to register but have done so voluntarily would not have to submit an annual return. The point which it is relevant to consider is one raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hilton. Where will the Charity Commission obtain all its resources? At the moment, as we all know, it is woefully under-resourced. There will be some transfers of manpower, as set out in the explanatory memorandum; but imposing requirements for small bodies to produce documents implies that someone will read them. It is almost impossible to believe that the Charity Commission will be given such resources as will make that a practical proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is not a practical proposition, what on earth is the point of making such charities submit annual reports? It would benefit some of the smallest charities and the Charity Commission if they were excepted. I do not believe in imposing duties on a public body when the Government, and no doubt any prospective government, are not likely to provide it with the resources to carry out those duties. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Viscount Mountgarret</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, my Lord Deputy Chairman, I did not spot the fact that you asked whether Clause 24 stood part of the Bill.

If there has been a mistake, the Committee might prefer to deal first with the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Harris.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to the noble Viscount, I did call Amendment No. 42A, but he was not present in the Chamber. The noble Lord, Lord Allen of Abbeydale, stepped into the breach to the best of his ability. The amendment was debated and withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had better return to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Harris.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that property held by charitable trusts, whatever the charitable trust, is properly accounted for, that proper records are kept, that accounts are prepared and that, in the case of registered charities, those accounts are submitted together with the annual report to the commission. That is a principle which underlies the whole of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new provisions very little more is being asked of trustees than they are required to do now and should be doing now if they are acting in a prudent fashion. There are a number of charities which are currently excepted from the need to register with the commissioners because they are subject to other supervisory systems. Such charities are denominational trusts which are held in connection with the Church of England or the Methodist Church. Some are large trusts and some are quite small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trustees of those trusts, whether large or small, should be under the same duties as other trustees regarding the preparation of their accounts. The amendment would remove from them the requirement to keep books of account, to prepare statements of account and to have their accounts audited or examined by an independent person. Moreover, they would not be required to submit their accounts to the commissioners (if they were registered), nor to any other body. That undermines the whole notion of public accountability for charitable funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trustees of charities should be accountable for the way in which they use their funds both to the commissioners and to the public. Where the charity is excepted they ought to be accountable to others. The justification of excepted status for those charities is that they are subject to a supervisory regime which must be at least as good as that provided by the commissioners in respect of registered charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to Amendment No. 47, to which the noble Lord, Lord Harris, referred and which deals with a similar issue. That amendment would mean that a number of registered charities would not be required to complete the annual return and their registered details could therefore not be updated annually. Those would be charities which had been registered voluntarily; in other words, charities whose trustees did not have to register but who wanted to register even though they were not obliged to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
I return to a point which I made in connection with an earlier amendment. Charities which register voluntarily do so because it is to their advantage. There are advantages in registering and there are liabilities. One of the advantages is that they have a registered number which helps them with their fund-raising. They may think that that gives them a certain cachet. In my view, any charity which is on the register, whether by obligation or voluntarily, should be subject to the same regime. Charities which want to take advantage of the benefits of being registered should also have to comply with the obligations imposed on them to ensure that the register is accurate. If one excuses a few charities from having to keep their registered details up to date one is saying that it is acceptable for part of the register to be accurate and part of it to be inaccurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle should be that if charities register they must comply with the obligations which that involves. It is right that those obligations should continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the noble Earl a question. Clause 25 states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in sections 20 to 24 applies to any exempt charity"</p></blockquote>
and the noble Earl has dealt with the point under Sections 32(1) and (2) of the 1960 Act—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except in accordance with subsection (5) below, nothing in section 24 applies to any charity (other than an exempt charity) which … is excepted by section 4(4) of the 1960 Act … and is not registered".</p></blockquote>
Does that mean that if it is registered, even if it is a charity with an income of less than £1,000, it is liable to the obligations in Clause 24? I see furious nods from all around the noble Earl and presume that that means yes. Therefore, it is the Government's intention to impose the Clause 24 obligations on charities which could have been exempted under the terms of the 1960 Act, as amended by this Bill, but which have not applied for exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an astonishing proposition. It means that a charity with an income of less than £1,000 a year could find itself liable to those obligations. Whether or not it is liable to those obligations will depend upon whether it is registered, not whether it is entitled to be registered. Perhaps I should put that the other way round: it depends not on whether it is entitled to avoid registration but on the fact of whether it does or does not register. That seems an astonishing proposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I understood correctly the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Richard. However, if I am correct I do not agree that it is astonishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain charities are excepted from the need to register. Those are charities with, among other things, an income of less than £1,000. It may be that, despite the fact that they are excepted by law from being registered, such charities may nevertheless wish to register. If they do register the obligations of registration continue just as much to them, although they come within the excepted category, as to any other charity which is registered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the other way round. As I understand it, if they register under the 1960 Act they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V005P0I0439">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
are exempt from the obligations in Clause 24 of the Bill which we have just debated. My point is that if they choose not to register under the 1960 Act it seems to me that they are liable under Clause 24 to those obligations, which seems to be a strange proposition. Or have I got it wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The noble Lord's final remark—which he made pseudo 
	<i>sotto voce</i> from a sedentary position—was, "Have I got that wrong?" I think that his interpretation is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Richard</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How is it wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most difficult questions are always the shortest. I cannot tell the noble Lord how he has got it wrong, only that he has got it wrong. If he will look at Clause 25(2) (b) he will find that that is so. I can only repeat that those who are excepted by law from registration but nevertheless have decided to do so are subject to the obligations of registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Brightman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it helps, but I agree entirely with everything said by the noble Earl.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are being invited to agree to a regulatory regime for charities whose income is less than £1,000 a year, which in my judgment is wholly unreasonable and pointless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pointed out the resource implications for the Charity Commission. What will be the cost per return of under £1,000 which is examined? Are officials really to be asked to examine charities with an income of £70, £80 or £150? What has happened to value for money? I can understand the need for vigilance in respect of charities with incomes of more than £1,000. However, in the case of trivial sums—which is what we are concerned with here—it seems to me be highly doubtful whether it is in the public interest that an organisation such as the Charity Commission, which is woefully under-resourced, will be required to become involved in such marginal issues. Accordingly I am minded to seek the opinion of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl Ferrers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Lord gets the bit between his teeth again, he asked me a question about resources which I did not answer. I apologise for that. In money terms the commissioners' resources will have been increased from £6 million to £21 million between 1987–88 and 1992–93. That is an enormous increase. The number of staff will have increased from 335 in 1987 to 712 in 1992. I cannot say what the future will hold but it is up to the commissioners to operate as best they can within the resources available to them and to take the decisions that are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The noble Lord said that small trusts have trivial sums of money. Perhaps they are trivial sums of money but that is not so in all cases. The point is that trusts operate in the public domain. It is right that trustees who have this money given to them for public use should be accountable. The Bill says that if these trusts have been excepted because they are, for instance, something to do with the Church of England
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
or the Methodist Churches, they should be nevertheless responsible to their parent trusts or their parent body—in other words, the Church of England or the Methodist Churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that does not deny them the obligation to account for what they have done. Those funds will not go to the Charity Commission. They will not even go to the Charity Commission if they have funds of under £1,000 but have not registered themselves. It is only when the funds have been under £1,000 and they have voluntarily decided to register with the Charity Commission that these obligations are put upon them. I repeat that it is important that those who want to take advantage of registration should do so but they ought also to have the obligations of registration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Baroness Faithfull</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1985 a survey was carried out of all the small charities in England, especially the parochial charities. Although the charities were small they were found to be immensely wasteful. Money was not being properly spent. It was not always being spent on the purpose for which the charity was set up. Although the charities were small—I understand the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Harris—nevertheless the aggregate amount of money that was being wasted was large. Although I stand to be corrected by my noble friend Lord Ferrers, I understand that the Charity Commission is thinking in terms of having regional officers to overlook these matters. They would get to know their areas just as local inspectors in schools get to know their areas. I support my noble friend Lord Ferrers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Harris of Greenwich</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reporting will not stop charities wasting money. They will have fulfilled the statutory requirement by sending in a report. It will not make any difference to a badly-run charity, and of course I recognise that there are badly-run charities. The noble Earl referred to the increase in resources made available to the Charity Commission. I was not particularly harshly criticising the Government. The number of officials to be made available to the Charity Commission and what their resources should be are difficult matters to decide. As is pointed out in the Explanatory Memorandum of the Bill, there will be some alteration of the resources available to the Charity Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question is a totally different one. What is the point of asking the commission to take responsibility for the smallest charities in the country, with sources of income of perhaps £80, £90, £100, £200 or £300? Do we really expect officials to start analysing those accounts? If I had anything to do with that organisation I would take the view that it was utterly pointless so to do and that it would be far more advantageous to look at the small to medium sized charities; those with sources of income of more than £100,000. As a matter of reality, no careful analysis of such small trusts will be made by the Charity Commission. All we are doing is increasing the bureaucratic overload. With respect, I now suggest that we take a decision on the matter. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The noble Lord said: This is a drafting amendment</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the noble Lord continues, I hope I may draw attention to two matters. First, there is a polar draught coming from the ceiling. Secondly, that does nothing to aid the acoustics in this room. It is not always easy to hear the valuable observations made by Members of the Committee. I hope those two points will be borne in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Deputy Chairman of Committees</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the noble Lord has said. Those are two matters with which we are all familiar and have been familiar on past occasions. I shall make arrangements to see whether anything can be done to improve the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In moving Amendment No. 44, I should point out that it is a drafting amendment. Clause 26(1) refers to an annual report. This amendment is designed to make it clear that that may be requested. I beg to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Peyton of Yeovil</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the obligation being placed on trustees here is not rather wide. The information concerned will, after all, be available to the commissioners and will be available to
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
those members of the public who wish to inspect it. To add to that, the entitlement that any person may write to the trustees and request a copy of the report and the accounts is, I believe, a little burdensome. I hope the Government will consider that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Viscount Astor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my noble friend Lord Peyton of Yeovil. This amendment would require charity trustees to supply to a member of the public, at his or her request, a copy of the charity's most recent annual report. This would be in addition to the requirement in Clause 26(3), as it stands, to supply a copy of the most recent accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, given the way many larger charities operate, supply of the accounts would include the supply of the annual report. However, there are many small exempted charities which do not produce an annual report. They may produce annual accounts but not an annual report. That is the difference. I could not advise the Committee against making the supply of the report a requirement, but, as I have said, many small charities do not produce a report. If the noble Lord wishes me to elaborate further I shall do so. However, I hope I have given a simple answer to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord Swinfen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I believe I have made a mistake. I said that I thought it was not compulsory to produce an annual report. However, I gather charities should produce an annual report and accounts under the terms of Clause 24. An annual report is an extremely good fund-raising tool for charities as it tells people what the charities are up to. The general public who may be asked to donate to a charity should be aware of what that charity is doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall elaborate on what I said earlier. Clause 26 applies to all charities, including exempt and excepted charities and charities which are companies. However, Clause 24, which makes provision for the preparation of an annual report and its submission to the Charity Commissioners, does not apply to exempt charities or to excepted charities (which have not chosen to register) or to charities which are companies. Therefore none of them would be required under the Bill to prepare annual reports other than in the circumstances described in Clause 25(3), which allows the commissioners to request the trustees of an excepted charity to provide an annual report on a particular occasion.

Charities which are companies are required to produce annual reports by the Companies Act 1985 and exempt charities may be required to do so by the particular enactment which is relevant to them. But there remain charities for whom there is no statutory requirement to produce a report, in contrast to the position in respect of accounts which, under a variety of enactments, all charities are, or will be, required to prepare.
