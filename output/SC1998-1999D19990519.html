	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say at the outset that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments, including any starred amendments that we may come to during an afternoon sitting of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->

	<div class='title'>REGULATIONS GIVING EFFECT TO CONVENTION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mark Oaten 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Winchester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say what a pleasure it is to serve again under your chairmanship, Mr. Malins. The previous occasion was on the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, which was complex, long and detailed, and you steered us through two months of proceedings during which I learned a lot about the procedures of the House. I think that I can guarantee that the proceedings on the Bill before us will not be as controversial, or last as long, as those on the previous Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Bill is important and recognises that, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of couples deciding to adopt children from foreign countries. The Bill will put in place protections and controls that recognise that trend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Hague convention, which is central to the Bill, was supported by the Government five years ago, but is yet to be ratified. The Bill will put that right. It allows for good practice to be put in place, recognising that local authorities have a duty to deal with intercountry adoption. It will tidy up some of the questions on entitlement to British nationality for children who are adopted in that way. It will make it clear to those who wish to bypass the due process of adopting a child in a foreign country that it is unacceptable to do so, and that bringing children into this country without going through the proper process will result in legal action against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put on the record my gratitude to hon. Members of all parties, especially those who have come to the Committee today. I was encouraged by the lengthy and positive discussion that we had on Second Reading. I know that the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) is on the Floor of the House, but I want to put on the record my gratitude to him for the support that he and the Department of Health have provided in preparing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Clause 1 is a major and important part of the Bill. It will enable the United Kingdom to give effect to the 1993 Hague convention, which was signed in January 1994. It will also provide the framework for setting minimum standards for processing intercountry adoption applications that work in the best interests of children who are adopted by people living overseas. The convention is drafted flexibly to allow countries that have signed up to its articles to be able to absorb them into their own substantive law. That is what clause 1 and other clauses will achieve. We signed and gave our support to the convention many years ago. It is long overdue for ratification and I am pleased that clause 1 will enable us finally to join the convention and ratify it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly endorse the words of welcome extended to you, Mr. Malins, by the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten). I have a few brief questions on clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like most hon. Members, I approach the problem with constituency experience. Two issues concern me. The first is the length of time that it can take for local authorities to complete the process of granting adoption rights to parents. The second issue, which came to my attention recently as part of a constitutency case, involves the recognition of intercountry adoption. A United Kingdom citizen who adopts a child from another country may not have the legitimacy of that adoption recognised by the UK authorities. What will happen when that child seeks British citizenship? Does the Bill deal with those concerns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising those points. He asked about time scales and whether the Bill will help to speed up local authorities. The intention is to remind local authorities that they have a statutory function to deal with intercountry adoption, which is dealt with in other clauses. I hope that regulations and good practice will encourage authorities to act. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that Hampshire is setting good practice by speeding up the process. We should be able to turn to other authorities and say that if Hampshire can complete the process in this time scale, then it can be done in other parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important effect of the Bill is to implement the Hague convention, which will speed up the time scales and the process of a child's adoption between signatory countries. A reduction in the number of requirements and court cases will also slim down the time involved. As for the ability to recognise adoptions, the Bill incorporates the duty that is in the convention to acknowledge an adoption that has been set up by another convention country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coatbridge and Chryston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Winchester for getting his Bill this far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one or two points to make which will help me to set clause 1 in the context of the Bill. My role in international development made me aware of some of the problems. Parents in underdeveloped or war-torn countries understandably want to give their child the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
advantage of growing up in a relatively wealthy country but, a year or two later, they may want the child back. City of Glasgow council, which is 10 miles from my constituency, has to its great credit been making arrangements for children of Kosovar refugees. The Bill may have an impact on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point concerns clarification of clause 1. Given the plans of the hon. Member for Winchester for the implementation of the Bill and the fact that local authorities will have a pivotal role, have the Government given him an idea of their view on resources?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Coatbridge and Chryston (Mr. Clarke) makes an important topical point given the sad events in Kosovo. The instinct of the British public when they see the images on television is to rush out and adopt a child. As the right hon. Gentleman said, there are problems with that. Relatives and parents who are presumed dead during a war may merely have been dispersed. It would be wrong if an adoption were rushed through and it was subsequently discovered that the parents were alive in another part of the world. Such cases may happen during wartime. That is why there is a convention that, during conflicts, permanent adoptions do not take place until at least two years after the conflict occurred. One hopes that that period will be sufficient to ensure that no relatives are still alive. It would be improper to break that convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, the Prime Minister has made it clear on many occasions that the refugees from Kosovo who are currently coming to this country should not be found homes for adoption because they want to go back to Kosovo. He expressed that view strongly yesterday when he visited the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Coatbridge and Chryston asked whether the Government had made resources available for good quality and good practice. He will know that private Member's Bills cannot incur costs, and that such considerations do not apply to the Bill. However, the critical issue is not cost but education and awareness in social services departments and local authorities. Some authorities perform the task very well, and they have provided a first-class service with very few additional costs. The Bill's provisions will help other authorities to provide a similar service without necessarily involving additional expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member for Winchester comment on paragraphs (a) and (b) in subsection (1), which state:
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The functions under the Convention of the Central Authority are to be discharged … in relation to Wales by the National Assembly".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph (a) states that those functions will be carried out
	<br><blockquote><p>"separately in relation to England and Scotland by the Secretary of State".</p></blockquote>
One might have expected a devolved power to be granted to Scotland. What is the rationale for doing so in relation to Wales but not in relation to Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says the clause deals with the establishment of central authorities and their powers. Perhaps I should explain the general position before I answer his question in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The central authorities will be responsible for implementing the Hague convention, and, in England, Scotland and Wales, the Department of Health will continue to be responsible for inter-country adoption. The functions to be discharged by the central authorities will differ little from current practice. It makes good practical and economic sense for the respective Department of Health offices to discharge the central authorities' functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Hague convention recommended that the central authorities should be set up, the intention was that a Government body should be involved. Later clauses deal with the process by which that will be done in Scotland and by the National Assembly for Wales. As we shall discuss later, there is a difficulty in relation to Scotland. Moreover, although initial meetings have occurred, the Assembly's first historic meeting is not due to take place until 1 July. The timing of the relevant legislation means that it is not yet possible to deal with the situation in Scotland in the Bill. I shall discuss that matter further when we come to later clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>EFFECT OF CONVENTION ADOPTIONS IN ENGLAND AND WALES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 3, line 5, leave out 'a child adopted under'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment and those grouped with it will have a minor effect. It clarifies the intention of proposed new subsection 3A to section 39 of the Adoption Act 1976, which will enable an application to be made to the High Court by any person adopted under the convention. The amendment would remove from line 25 the obtrusive and irrelevent word, "above". As drafted, the proposed new section could be interpreted to permit only children under 18 to apply to the High Court. Clearly, such a restriction was not intended and it is more likely that such applications will be made by the adoptive adult.

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment's reference to the adopted child is consistent with the meaning of "adopted child" in section 39 of the 1976 Act. Section 39 provides that, where the adopters are a married couple, an adopted child should be treated in law as if he or she had been born as a child of the marriage. Clearly, that status is conferred not for the duration of childhood, but for life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words about clause 4, which is complex and requires explanation. United Kingdom adoption law recognises only one type of adoption, known as full adoption, which creates a new and irrevocable legal relationship between the child and the adoptive parents, and severs all legal ties between the child and the birth parents. However, in some other countries, certain forms of adoption, known as simple adoptions, do not sever those ties. Article 26 of the Hague convention recognises full adoptions and simple adoptions, but does not prejudice the application of any legal provision in force in the contracting state if it is more favourable to the child.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: According to my understanding of the explanatory notes, in the case of a convention adoption, provided that the child's adoptive parents are habitual residents in the United Kingdom, the clause will enable the child automatically to acquire British nationality even if neither of the adoptive parents is a British citizen. Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause is complicated. It will require at least one of the adoptive parents to be a British citizen at the time that the adoption order is made. Therefore, it would not be possible for British nationality to be granted to a convention adoption child unless at least one of the parents had British citizenship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Leigh 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gainsborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, clause 7 provides that children who are adopted and acquire British citizenship automatically lose the citizenship of the country from which they came. What is the precedent for that? Is there any argument for children having dual nationality? Is it right for children to be deprived of their original cultural heritage? Is it right that children who find new parents should automatically lose all links with the country from which they came? I am worried about that and would like some reassurance from the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an important point. I have spoken to a number of adopting couples about this and it is essential that the origins of the child are recognised and celebrated. I have met couples who have gone on family holidays to the country of origin, thereby making it a feature of family life. The intention behind the clause is not to wipe out any nationality or suggest that the adopted child should become English and forget his or her origins. Indeed, dual nationality would be an option if that were the choice of the individuals concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause gives adopted children from foreign countries similar rights to those enjoyed by children adopted in this country. The intention is to create a level playing field. Couples who have adopted a child from a foreign country can already apply to the courts for citizenship for the child, but the clause makes that an automatic right, without recourse to the courts, as part of the convention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause. I mentioned earlier the hope that local authorities would take a positive attitude towards intercountry adoption. Under the clause, local authorities should make little or no distinction between domestic and intercountry
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
adoption in their treatment of adoption applications. Local authorities will be expected to treat intercountry adoption applications with the same thoroughness and within the same broad time scales as they do domestic adoptions. They will also be expected to apply the principle that a person who is not suitable to adopt a child living in the United Kingdom cannot be recommended as suitable to adopt a child living overseas, which is an important point. There is no short cut—parents who have been turned down for adoption in this country cannot assume that they can go abroad to adopt a child, as if that child were a third-class citizen. I hope that the clause will ensure that local authority practices improve throughout the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Faversham and Mid-Kent)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I may ask this question during the debate on this clause. Inquiries into a couple's suitability for adopting are subject to a wide variety of charges and, I suspect, a wide variety of standards and presuppositions. Will the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee whether any standardisation is proposed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the hon. Gentleman also tell us whether he thinks that local authorities and voluntary agencies are equipped to make these judgements? The process is extremely expensive for some couples, and it is psychologically damaging for them if they are turned down. Times have changed since I was a young man, when a friend of mine applied to adopt a child. Officials from the adoption agency visited the home, found it a total shambles and decided that it was far too untidy a home in which to place a child. They then discovered that the prospective parents were rather grand people and instantly reversed their decision. It seems that the decisions made on both sides of that argument were disgraceful. Although I am sure that we have moved on from such occurrences, there remains unease about the standards in adoption investigations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome clause 9. Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that it introduces efficient and proper procedures for bringing intercountry adoption into the mainstream of adoption services in this country? Will he also confirm that intercountry adoption should be seen as a service for children rather than for adopters, and as a service that operates in the best interests of children? It should be a service of last resort, to be provided only for children who cannot be looked after appropriately in their own home and who cannot be placed in foster care or with adoptive parents in their own country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have another question for the hon. Member for Winchester. When he introduced the clause, he seemed to suggest that local authorities will be under a duty to process these applications as expeditiously as they would when dealing with a normal adoption within this country. Will the hon. Gentleman comment on the possibility that that may place an undue burden on local authorities?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To take a topical subject, there may be many Kosovar children in need of a home in a western country. I have no objection to that. However, the inquiries involved could be long and difficult. A child
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
from Kosovo may seem to be an orphan, but that could be difficult to determine, given the present chaotic circumstances in the Balkans. The measure might place an undue burden on local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Leigh), that point was raised earlier, although there is no reason why he should not pursue it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried as to how the measure will impact on local authorities. I remember my local authority background, when I was president of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. A matter that worried local authorities then—I do not think that things have changed much—was that this House would often produce legislation that would land on the desks of local authorities, which would be expected to respond without a great deal of discussion. I am not saying that that is the case at present, but I would like to be assured that local authorities are at least aware that we are discussing this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to pick up on all the points raised by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. The hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) asked about the various cost levels and whether a cap could be centrally set, and I have much sympathy with the point. Couples trying to adopt a child, from this country or abroad, have often gone through a year or two of infertility treatment, for example, and that can be very expensive. I have looked into the matter of costs in some detail, and there is no doubt but that the costs involved in inter country adoption are considerably higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a mixed set of charges among different authorities. Some provide a service for £1,000, whereas other charge £4,000 to £5,000. Couples do not know why they are being charged different amounts. In the regulations and guidance that will be issued under the Bill, the Department of Health will provide social service departments with recommendations on the level of charges, which cannot be set in legislation but will have to be decided at a local level. By taking a much more open approach to the charges and encouraging local authorities to explain to prospective adopters why the charges have built up, we shall have transparency and a model of good practice—a set of indicators—that I hope will ensure that charges level out at a certain point.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point, and I am glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre raised it. The Children Act 1989—there is separate legislation for Scotland—makes the rights of the child paramount. If the hon. Gentleman could respond to that question positively, we would be more reassured.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. The rights of the child are highlighted throughout the Bill. The Hague convention was underpinned by the 1989 United Nations convention on the rights of the child. Consequently, the 1989 convention is reflected in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gainsborough made several points on the Bill. If he reminds me of them, I will be happy to respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just asked whether the chaotic conditions in different parts of the world would place an undue burden on local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman jogs my memory. As I said, the fact that some authorities have no problem in managing the process means that it should not necessarily be an undue burden; if they can do it, other authorities can. The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about complex cases in which a difficult judgment may need to be made. In some cases, children come from different parts of the world but the local authority does not have the relevant experience. There should be leeway to allow more time to be taken to make value judgments on those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision on whether someone is a suitable parent should be made on the same basis, regardless of whether he or she is adopting a child from this or a foreign country. The Bill tries to make the point that the rights of the child are the same, wherever they may come from. Having spoken to some local authorities on the matter, I know that they are often confused when they receive an application from a prospective adopter and do not know how to deal with it. That is what can take time. The Bill will set some clearer guidelines. I think that authorities will welcome that and see it as a way of speeding up the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there any provision in adoption law for the unfortunate circumstances of a real parent suddenly surfacing from somewhere like Kosovo, having had their child adopted from the best possible motives? Could such a parent get the child back?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an excellent point. I mentioned earlier the convention that adoptions cannot take place until two years after the conflict in the war zone. That convention is designed to deal with the situation that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. The problem that often arises, however, is that individual local authorities are not responsible for the conduct of the processes that are used by adoption organisations in foreign countries. It is, therefore, difficult for authorities to deal with the problem. The convention, which tries to prevent the situation from
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
arising in the first place, is in place. The powers that local authorities have suddenly to reverse a decision are certainly limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be difficult to change the process. It would be possible for the natural parents, if they suddenly emerged, to apply for contact or a residence order under the Children Act 1989. They can try to get access to their children by that route. However, that is certainly not an issue for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dawson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gave the hon. Member for Winchester several issues on which to respond. On the issue of whether intercountry adoption is a last resort, my impression of the Bill and my reason for supporting it is that it makes the measures for intercountry adoption more efficient. It brings them within the proper legal framework that applies to all adoptions in this country. However, if our procedures are to be correctly founded on the Hague convention and the UN convention on the rights of the child, the Bill should not lead to a huge increase in the number of intercountry adoptions. That is simply because one of the baseline factors that must be taken into account is whether a child can be looked after properly in his own country by his own parents, by foster services or using other means of support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. It is not the Bill's intention that there should suddenly be a massive Government advertising campaign that says, "Go and adopt a child in a foreign country." There is no doubt that the hon. Gentleman's points are right. As I said at the outset, the Bill is underpinned by the UN convention on the rights of the child. Furthermore, the convention makes the points that the hon. Gentleman made. I am, therefore, secure in my mind that the Bill will ensure that children are adopted from foreign countries only when every route has been explored in that country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this is an appropriate point to raise this awkward issue. The point has been made to me on more than one occasion by people who are interested in the subject, that the mechanisms for controlling adoption in this country pass through such a fine bottleneck that only one or two people set the policy for the entire system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many years ago, I was a civil servant in the Scottish Office. It dealt with a relatively small number of mentally ill criminals in state institutions. The branch that was supposed to deal with those prisoners contained what was, in those days, called a higher executive officer. He was the executive of the appeal mechanism. All state prisoners who felt aggrieved
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
wrote to the Secretary of State, and the higher executive officer processed the letter. Because the Scottish Office was so small, however, he also drafted the Secretary of State's reply. Clearly, that was an improper way of dealing with such matters and when it eventually came to light, the two functions were properly separated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that a very small unit within the Department of Health runs the adoption service in this country—it sets the standards, creates regulations, makes the eventual approvals, and so on—there is anxiety about whether aggrieved adopters, for example, can feel confident that if they disagree with the Department of Health or one of its approved agencies, they will be treated even-handedly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. John Hutton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help the hon. Gentleman if I point out that the Government's White Paper on modernising social services made it clear that when we have the opportunity, we intend to introduce measures to improve the regulation and inspection of voluntary adoption agencies. Obviously, we want them to observe the highest quality of practice. We will look for the earliest opportunity to convert the intentions that we outlined in the White Paper into a practical set of legal requirements applying to the operation of voluntary adoption agencies. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman that we take on board what he said about ensuring standards and quality practice in adoption agencies and we intend to legislate to reinforce that through more effective regulatory and inspection arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I was making an important point. If the number of personnel coping with this issue in the Department of Health is very small, someone who comes unstuck in their application or another matter relating to an adoption could naturally feel deeply aggrieved and anxious that their papers will be processed by exactly the same people who were responsible for the system that turned them down. That was what I was anxious to point out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I might help the hon. Gentleman. He makes a good point about where in the process there is a chance for an appeal—for want of a better word—against a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to understand the process. When prospective parents reach the point of being approved for adoption, they have gone through quite a detailed set of home study reports. At points during the work on those reports, discussion—I would not like to use the word "appeal"—can take place between those carrying out the report and the individuals who have applied to be approved to adopt. Thus, if the couple have concerns about the process, it is right that they should air them at that point, rather than being turned down and then trying to appeal to the Secretary of State. The Bill clearly establishes that the Department of Health—that is, a Government body—remain the central authority that oversees that process. I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
certainly not implying that the Bill should take the final decision-making process away from Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As the clause was being debated, doubts came into my head. I am grateful to the hon.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that in a moment, but first I should like to make my final point to the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent about the small adoption unit in the Department of Health. No doubt it is lean and efficient, but I would not want the hon.

We can rest assured that adoption policy is not being set by one or two individuals.

The right hon. Member for Coatbridge and Chryston pressed me again on the timing for the Scottish Parliament. The Parliament will have full responsibility for adoption and many of the right hon.

	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals in some detail with how a decision can be taken on whether a child is suitable for adoption at present. In my reply to the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent, I spoke about the need for home study reports. The clause prohibits privately commissioned home study reports, which is extremely important in trying to do away with the bad practice of adoption. At present, local authorities or approved agencies have the important responsibility of carrying out home study reports. It is right and proper that the responsibility should remain there. What gives cause for concern is the fact that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
individuals could purchase a home study report from another organisation and wave around the world a report that purports to say that they are suitable to adopt a child. There are several reasons why that would be wrong and the clause rightly prohibits such reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a concern that paying for a report must put its independence in question. A couple paying £5,000 or £6,000 for a report on whether they are suitable to adopt a child would be somewhat aggrieved having paid that amount to discover that the report turned them down. That probably makes it clear that such a practice cannot be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also important that a social worker and someone with the relevant skills and attributes should be involved in putting the report together. That is not always the case when a report is privately commissioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally and very importantly, there will be occasions when police and private reports on individuals have to be obtained. Local authorities and appointed agencies will now have that power, but those producing a private study report will not. Issues of access to information are involved. The kind of information that should be considered to decide whether couples are suitable would not be provided to those who carry out private study reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important clause which will, I hope, do away with the bad practice of privately commissioned reports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>RESTRICTION ON BRINGING CHILDREN INTO THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR ADOPTION</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to over-emphasise the problems that the clause would address. There have been some reported cases in the media and there are sad examples of individuals who have privately commissioned home reports or tried to bypass the proper process for bringing children into the country. The clause makes it a criminal offence for a person resident in the British Isles to bring into the United Kingdom for the purpose of adoption a child who is resident outside these islands unless he or she has gone through the proper process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those requirements may apply either prior to the child's arrival, to deal with evidence showing that a person or couple is preparing to break the law, or within a period to be prescribed after a child's arrival.
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
For example, it could be an offence for an adopter to fail to notify his or her local authority of the child's arrival within the specified period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Current legislation dealing with such offences provides that proceedings can be brought only within six months from the date on which the offence was committed. That could mean six months from when a child was brought in late at night at Margate. The clause ensures that proceedings for an offence may be brought within six months from the date on which sufficient evidence is available to demonstrate that the illegal adoption occurred. That means that an adopter cannot bring in a child to Margate, hide that child for six months, and then breathe a sigh of relief. The criminal offence will kick into place from when the action is discovered to have occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not want the Committee to get the impression that hundreds of such cases arise every year, but the clause is important, and it is right and proper to introduce provisions to tidy up the law in respect of such cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the reason for the clause, and I do not oppose it. I am, however, a tiny bit worried about it, as it deals with people who are often very desperate. The provisions potentially allow the imprisonment of a mother for committing an offence as specified under the clause. What she has done may be wrong, but does the Minister genuinely envisage such people going to prison?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point occurs to me in relation to the hon. Gentleman's remarks. The clause deals with circumstances that are often tragic and which often involve childless couples. I repeat that what such people do is wrong, but at least they know that there is a cut-off point. As the Bill provides no six-month cut-off point, couples might seek to hide a child forever. Is the clause in the child's interest in that respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman expresses important concerns. I must again emphasise that the provisions relate to isolated cases. I understand his point about couples being desperate, but we discussed earlier the importance of putting the child first. It is these very clauses that are needed if we are to speak the language of putting the child first. It is difficult to deal with a desperate mother with such legislation, but it cannot be right to put a child through the trauma involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps a person covered by the clause will have met a child in the airport in Amsterdam. He or she could then have driven the child for many hours through the continent, and travelled back by ferry, bringing the child into Britain at Margate. However desperate a person is to adopt, that process cannot be right, and it cannot be proper to allow a child to be put through such stress. Some resort to criminal action must be available in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the courts will be sensitive and sympathetic, but some individuals will be involved in such activities in an organisation. They will not necessarily be desperate mothers, and may be gaining
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V005P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to those remarks, I should like only to draw the attention of the hon. Member for Gainsborough to a specific aspect of the clause. We are trying to tidy up the law relating to the six-month period, which is necessary for reasons made clear by the hon. Member for Winchester. I should point out that proceedings cannot be brought more than three years after the offence in question was committed, which is a necessary and sensible measure. The fundamental point that I should like to make to the hon. Member for Gainsborough is that the provision is an essential part of the new foundations on which we want to build better practice in intercountry adoptions. We cannot have people bringing children into the United Kingdom without the proper procedures established in the Hague convention, which the Bill will incorporate into British law. I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns about civil liberties, but the provision is important and necessary.

I want to raise a serious point that the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent will recall from discussions in Committee on various Bills affecting children.

Worse than that, if there is an adversarial situation, the child is often seen as the prize at the end. I am sure that the hon. Member for Winchester would not want to consider the matter in that way, and I do not suggest that we are as far ahead in Scotland as once we were in holding informal children's hearings. However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will endorse the view that in discussions between two parties who may have had a difference and are therefore debating the future of a child, the child's future may gain by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
decision being taken in an informal setting. I hope that, notwithstanding the provisions of clause 16, the hon. Gentleman agrees with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Oaten</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman makes a passionate plea for trying to keep courts out of consideration of children's interests. I could not agree more. One encouraging aspect about the convention is that its purpose is to achieve just that. An exciting part of the Hague convention is that we are signing up with a number of other countries to say that we are prepared to recognise and take in good faith the processes that happen in those countries and set aside the approach of treating every adoption by recourse to the courts. That is why I hope that we will ratify it. I reassure the right hon. Gentleman that the Bill is about less court activity and more conventions and understanding—avoiding putting children into a difficult and emotional court situation.

The right hon. Gentleman asked me to clarify when the Scottish Parliament will take on its powers. It will assume its full powers on 1 July. The First Minister will hopefully make a statement to the Parliament drawing attention to the Bill, to explain that it is still before Westminster. The Bill is a pre-enactment piece of legislation that will allow full powers to be assumed from that date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
