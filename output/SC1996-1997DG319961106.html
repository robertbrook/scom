	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Andrew Mitchell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Committee has considered the draft Child Support Departure Direction and Consequential Amendments Regulations 1996.".</p></blockquote>
On behalf of the Committee, may I say what a pleasure it is to appear before you this afternoon, Mrs. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations pave the way for the full introduction of this important change in the way in which child support liability is calculated. They follow on from the anticipatory regulations, which we debated in May, which have now been successfully piloted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision to test the departures regulations and procedures by running a pilot, followed from the lessons learnt from the start-up of the Child Support Agency. As expected, the pilot proved extremely valuable: in particular, it gave the agency the opportunity to test and refine procedures before it had to introduce the full scheme. The pilot exercise began as planned on 9 April. A pilot evaluation report has now been produced and copies placed in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity to thank the staff of the pilot offices in Hastings, Gravesend, Basildon, Ilford and Ealing for their hard work on the pilot cases, which were completed within a very demanding time frame to enable lessons to be learnt and changes to be made in time for the full introduction of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a direct result of problems identified by the pilot, the Child Support Agency has been able to make a number of useful refinements to its procedures, to the computer system and to the letters and forms sent to parents. Those refinements will help the agency to deal more smoothly and efficiently with the full implementation of the departures system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I looked carefully at the evidence from the pilot to see if any changes were appropriate to the grounds for departure, but the pilot confirmed my view that there is little need for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the pilot, there were applications in all of the departures categories, the most popular being inconsistent lifestyle; apportionment of housing costs; travel to work; debts of the relationship; and contact costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Members of the Committee will be interested to note that there was an almost even split of applications between parents with care and absent parents and that applications from parents with care were as likely to succeed as those from absent parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fifty-seven per cent. of applications were on more than one ground, with an average close to three grounds for each of the multiple ground applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pilot shows that around 10 to 15 per cent. of all applications are likely to be successful. That level of success is very much in line with other similar appeals systems. Just over 2,000 departure applications have been dealt with during the pilot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will, of course, continue to monitor the new scheme very closely. The pilot was not able to test all aspects of the departures scheme and full live running may identify issues that the pilot could not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to go over the regulations in great detail, but it will, I hope, be helpful if I mention the main provisions. The departures system introduces an important new principle into the child support scheme—the use of discretion which will provide the flexibility required to allow the greater recognition of expenses and commitments not covered by the formula. At the same time, it will enable the agency to crack down on absent parents who seek to reduce their child support liabilities by diverting income elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three broad catergories under which a parent may apply for a departure. The first category, in regulations 13 to 20, covers certain special expenses that the applicant has to meet. These are high travel-to-work costs not fully dealt with in the broads brush allowance for travel-to-work costs; high costs in maintaining contact with children; costs arising from the illness or disability of the applicant or a dependant; debts incurred while the family were together; pre-April 1993 financial commitments from which it is impossible or unreasonable for the parent to withdraw; and the costs of supporting stepchildren, where responsibilities were taken on before April 1993. Except in the case of illness or disability and the costs of supporting stepchildren, a threshold of £15 must be passed before a parent can qualify under the provisions. In the case of a parent applying under more than one of these grounds at the same time, only one £15 threshold will be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second category, in regulations 21 and 22, is where there has been a property or capital transfer—often referred to as a clean-break arrangement—before 5 April 1993. There are three circumstances in which a parent may wish to make a departure application: first, if the allowance under the broad-brush formula provisions does not adequately reflect the value of the settlement; secondly, if a formula allowance was awarded when the whole of the settlement was for spousal liabilities; and thirdly, if no formula allowance was given. The different evidence requirements and method for valuing the settlement can mean that the departure system will give a different result. If a departure direction is given, the formula allowance will be removed and the value of the settlement deducted from the weekly maintenance liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The third, and final, category is in regulations 23 to 29 and covers certain other specified circumstances. They include first, assets capable of producing an income, or higher income, and examples could be where a parent has large amounts held in cash that could be invested or empty properties that could be rented out to obtain an income; secondly, diversion of income, including cases in which a parent diverts part of his income to be paid to a new wife or partner or in which money is not taken as a salary but is left in a business where the absent parent still has access to it; and, thirdly, lifestyle cases in which a parent's overall lifestyle is significantly out of line with the level of income on which the maintenance assessment is based, including, for example, cases in which a self-employed parent declares only low profits by offsetting income against business expenses or in which the parent has a number of expensive pursuits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cases involving diversion of income and inconsistent lifestyle will, because of their complex nature, initially be referred directly to a child support appeal tribunal for decision if there is evidence to suggest that there is a case to answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members will be as concerned as I am about absent parents who are able to conceal or divert large parts of their income to reduce their liability and pass on their responsibilities to the taxpayer. The new rules will close those loopholes, ensuring that children receive the maintenance that is rightfully theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deal now with the transitional arrangements. The regulations do not prescribe the order of take-on of departure cases but cases will be taken on in a number of separate tranches. That will avoid a backlog of cases building up with consequent delays in obtaining decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we invited parents to take part in the pilot, we made a commitment that pilot cases would be taken on first, subject to a check that their circumstances remained unaltered. The agency will honour that commitment by writing to those parents to seek confirmation that they wish their departure applications to go forward. The agency will then deal with those cases first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For operational simplicity, the CSA will also take on new cases—cases in which the maintenance assessment takes effect after 2 December this year—as they arise. Information about how to apply for a departure will be sent to parents with notification of their maintenance assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other cases in which there is an existing assessment will be taken on in phases. Mailshots will be sent out, inviting applications for departures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first tranche to be contacted will include cases in which liability is likely to cease in the short term. That will be a limited group of cases in which the youngest child is 15 years old or over. Remaining stock cases will be taken on according to the age of the maintenance assessment on an oldest case first basis since those applicants with the oldest maintenance assessments will have waited longest for relief under the departures system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
We aim to invite applications from all stock cases by April 1997 although, if volumes are higher than the pilot has indicated, that period may be extended to September 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear that parents will not lose out because of this phased take-on. Parents with a maintenance assessment current at 2 December 1996 who make an application for a departure by 1 December 1997 will have any departure award backdated to 2 December 1996, providing that all conditions were met at that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the appeals process, one aspect that could not be tested in the pilot. Departure directions determined by the Secretary of State will carry the right of appeal to the child support appeal tribunal, which is independent of the Child Support Agency. In addition, as I have indicated both on diversion of income and on lifestyle, cases that raise novel or particularly contentious issues may be referred directly by the CSA to the independent tribunal service for determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the procedures for handling departure appeals are the same as those used for other types of decisions in child support, except that in certain circumstances a tribunal may be constitued by a chairman sitting alone. Those cases include appeals against a decision to refuse an application following a preliminary consideration, and property and capital transfer cases—both complex cases that are referred directly for a decision and appeals against directions given by the agency. It will be open to the chairman, however, to decide that an application or appeal should be put to a full tribunal. The arrangements will enable appeals to be dealt with quickly and efficiently. The changes introduced by the regulations are part of the continuing process of reviewing the child support scheme. We have already introduced several measures to make the system fairer. The new arrangements will give us the flexibility that we need to provide further help for those parents upon whom the formula bears hardest. The changes and the continuing improvements in the administration of the scheme will further the process of public acceptance of the principles behind the Child Support Act 1991. I commend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Wicks 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Child support policy—policy relating to the financial maintenance of children in family breakdown or other circumstances in which children do not live with both natural parents—is difficult territory for Government and for Parliament, as we have discovered in recent years. There are at least two reasons for that. The first is that making such policy is an attempt by Government to deal with complex and often fraught and traumatic human relationships, and to intervene at some of the most difficult times for adults and children. The second relates to the issue of whether public policies should be based on discretion, and the examination of individual cases on their merits—perhaps through judicial discretion in a court-based system—or whether an administrative system
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
based around a national formula is possible. The Child Support Act is, of course, based on the latter model. It is an administrative system with a national formula. Today we are to debate how to build flexibility, sensitivity and discretion around that system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the occasion to rehearse all the arguments relating to the issue that I have outlined, but a reminder of the context in which we are judging the regulations may be a useful background for the Committee. The Labour party has urged the Government to reform child support. We have no wish to go back to the old court-based system—mainly because it did not work, and it is not the job of social policy to reinvent the broken wheel. We have sometimes pressed successfully for reforms. The appeals system is the result of pressure by our party. As the Minister said, a White Paper on child support has been produced in recent times, and the Child Support Act 1995 amended child support policy. On 7 May, Members considered what were, I think, described as pilot regulations—somewhat to the merriment of one of the Members of the Committee concerned, who was not sure what pilot regulations were. The pilot regulations were discussed in a statutory instruments Committee and I suppose, therefore, that we have already undertaken a pilot scrutiny of a kind. I mention that because we do not want to rehearse all the relevant arguments again today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for making available to me the evaluation report on the departure directions pilot study, which is also, he said, in the House of Commons Library. I want to raise two questions. First, does the Minister agree that by any measure the take-up on the pilot study has been disappointing? I understand from the report that in about 25,000 cases, clients of the Child Support Agency were invited to apply, if they wanted to, for departures. The report states that 23 per cent. requested application forms but only 6 per cent. of the 25,000 made formal applications, and that only 10 or 15 per cent. of applicants are likely to be successful. If my arithmetic is correct, that represents less than 1 per cent. of the group that was invited to consider applying. Am I right in thinking that the group of 25,000 was not selected at random from the CSA caseload, but that it consisted of people who might have a prima facie case for departure? If that is so, a success rate of slightly less than 1 per cent. is surprising. I do not make the mistake of expecting even 50 per cent. of what appear to be prima facie cases for departure to be successful. However, if my arithmetic is roughly correct, the success rate is surprisingly low for a target group of likely cases. Can the Minister shed more light on that small percentage?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is not simply arithmetical. It has occasioned debate in the House about how to ensure that cases of just grievance in which, for example people believe that travel-to-work costs have not been taken into account, or in which the parent with care—usually the mother—believes that her ex-husband is camouflaging income, are properly tackled. It was
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
stressed by hon. Members of all parties that sensitivity and discretion should be allowed in such cases. In view of that, the success rate is poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that roughly half of the cases were brought by parents with care, normally mothers, and half by absent parents, usually fathers. However, a slight majority—53 per cent.—were brought by parents with care. As I am not the President of the United States, I am not too worried about a clear majority, but the figure is 53 per cent. Many cases were about inconsistent lifestyle—cases in which an absent parent claims that his income is too low to pay more, yet he allegedly drives a Jaguar, goes on foreign holidays and thus seems to hoodwink the CSA about his true income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A smaller category of cases involved diversion of income—cases in which an absent parent pays his current partner a substantial income as company secretary and thus hoodwinks the system. Who should provide the evidence in such cases?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evaluation report states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"around 90 per cent. of applications under inconsistent lifestyle or diversion of income grounds can be eliminated at an early stage as being unsubstantiated by evidence provided."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"many PWCs"—or parents with care—"were unable to provide adequate evidence to support their application."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, an application requires evidence in order to be successful. However, the report suggests that the parent with care should provide the evidence. That may not be fair. A genuine problem could exist—the absent parent's income could be far higher than he admits, or he might be diverting income. Does the Minister expect the mother, who is often in vulnerable circumstances, to produce accounts and an actuary's report? I exaggerate to emphasise the point. If there are reasonable grounds for an investigation, the CSA should undertake it, or the case should go to a tribunal that can call for all the papers and full disclosure. On the basis of the evaluation report, I believe that mothers do not get a fair deal and that their cases are dismissed too lightly. My constituency caseload supports that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux about the matter. In a letter, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This places an unfair burden on the individual parent with care who will not necessarily have the resources or power to uncover deception or to secure genuine evidence from their estranged partner."</p></blockquote>
It adds that it thinks that a tribunal might be the best means of obtaining such information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leyton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably the person making such an allegation is the parent with care. If an allegation originates from the parent with care, surely there should be some requirement on him or her to provide evidence. A parent with care should not just say, "I think he is living an exorbitant lifestyle", and then leave it up to someone else to investigate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wicks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that this is difficult territory. We must beware of those who make such allegations simply as a weapon against former partners because of the fraught circumstances of their relationships. However, we must strike a balance. For example,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

someone may see with her own eyes that her former partner is living an exorbitant lifestyle with—let us caricature it—an expensive Jaguar car. She may think that the Child Support Agency has not been given the full facts, but it will place an undue burden on her if she is required to produce all the evidence. I make that point because many mothers say that, although they thought that the child support policy was designed to provide more maintenance for their children, the system is not working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) for introducing an important balance into the argument. However, it must be a concern that the pilot scheme reveals such a low success rate. That suggests that all the evidence must come from the parent with care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also welcome you, Mrs. Winterton, to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Wicks) pointed out, the regulations carry forward the pilot regulations that we debated on 7 May. The pilot scheme has not been completed and the regulations will apply nationwide. I welcomed the pilot, but I would like to see how it will operate nationally. The pilot was only a dummy exercise because nobody received immediate financial gain. Perhaps, that is one of the reasons for the low take-up rate of 6 per cent. People may have thought that if they were not going to receive any financial benefit from the pilot, there was no point in applying for the departure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must evaluate the nationwide scheme carefully. I am pleased that the Minister said that he would do that. Even though the pilot scheme was of limited use for the purposes of evaluation, it is amazing that 90 per cent. of the applications were under the grounds of inconsistent lifestyle or diversion of income. Of those cases, 90 per cent. could not be proven, so the points made by the hon. Members for Leyton and for Croydon, North-West are valid. There must be a balance. If parents with care make allegations about inconsistent lifestyles, they must provide evidence to back up their allegations. It is then up to the Child Support Agency to carry on the investigation as long as the parent with care provides reasonable evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Llin Golding 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newcastle-under-Lyme)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady. In one case I obtained wage slips that proved that someone had an unreasonable lifestyle when he was supposed to be on income support. I sent them to the Child Support Agency, but it said that it was not interested in fraud of the benefit system and that it was up to the fraud agencies to deal with that. Even when I provided evidence, the Child Support Agency was not interested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point because I have experience of similar cases in my constituency. Parents with care have come to me and sent evidence to the CSA. They think—whether they are justified in thinking so or not—that the CSA has not investigated
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
their cases fully. When parents with care provide evidence, the CSA must take note of it and investigate the cases properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the political parties want to clamp down on benefit fraud, and the same applies to child support fraud. We must be sure about allegations and back-up evidence. It is up to the Child Support Agency to follow that through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the way in which the regulations will be implemented, what is the Minister's estimate of the proportion of people expected to apply and receive departure when the scheme goes nationwide? How quickly will applications be processed and the departure applied? These are important questions to which all members of the Committee require answers from the Minister. At present 15 per cent. of current maintenance claims have not been cleared in a year. If that applies to those claims, will there not be a similar delay for departures? Although there have been slight improvements in the way in which the CSA has been run, it has still not gone far enough in ensuring that claims are processed sufficiently speedily. The departure system is welcome in so far as it changes an Act with which I disagree but it will not be welcome if people have to wait for more than a year for claims to be agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the departure for calculating travel cost be assessed, especially in relation to contact with children and frequency of visits? How many visits will be allowed? The Secretary of State has stated that it is the responsibility of the liable parent and the parent with care to reach agreement about this, but we all know that after a marriage breakdown there is often no agreement between the parent with care and the liable parent: sometimes they do not talk civilly to each other anyway. If the parents cannot reach agreement, how often can the liable parent visit the child? Will it be monthly or weekly, or on a six-monthly basis for that to be taken into account? The regulations do not provide for this. Can the Minister reassure the Committee that rules and recommendations for the frequency of visits will be put in place? A parent with care may decide to reduce visits, for whatever reason—perhaps the 104-night rule because the parent with care or liable parent is taking the child away for a night, or because the parent with care is being difficult, saying to the liable parent, "I do not wish you to see the child on this date. It is inconvenient" or perhaps "I cannot get him ready in time"—all the excuses that parents use. Can the Minister clarify the position regarding maintenance payments if the parent with care refuses the liable parent access to the child? Do payments increase, or decrease?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee needs clarification about compensation for delay in gaining departures, specifically on the grounds of illness and disability, of either the liable parent or the person being cared fora parent, a partner or next spouse. Will compensation be payable for undue delay? Some provision for compensation needs to be written in for such cases.

The need for departure proves beyond doubt the failure of the formula system and of the Child Support Act in general. I want it repealed and replaced with a unified family court system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mrs. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Ms Lynne) about the need for balance—the point on which I intervened earlier. An allegation of an excessive lifestyle in this context should not be taken up for its own sake as that could waste a great deal of the CSA's time and the absent parent could be unnecessarily intimidated. If an allegation is made with some evidence to back it up, there is a case for it to be properly investigated. The Minister must get the balance right here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a relative outsider in this issue, apart from at my advice surgeries where I have received a great many representations. To what extent does the fact that this is an agency as distinct from a branch of a Department as it would have been formerly, empower the Minister to request or even direct the agency to act in a certain way, particularly when prima facie evidence is presented and there is an obligation to investigate and perhaps act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is best placed to tell us what powers he has to get the agency to investigate matters. I was alarmed by the comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle under Lyme (Mrs. Golding) that the Child Support Agency was not interested in, or did not have the power to deal with, allegations of fraud. Clearly, someone who is associated with the Child Support Agency should deal with allegations of fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome this departure direction, which brings some discretion and flexibility to the system. When the agency was set up it was so rigid that there was a lot of unfairness. It was, quite frankly, a mess. The Government have been, in their words, fine-tuning it, or, as I would say, correcting it ever since. Perhaps that is the kindest way to put it. This is part of that process. I welcome that element of flexibility. But what about all those who have been treated unfairly since April 1993? Can the proposals be backdated? Surely they should be backdated if somebody made a clean-break settlement before April 1993 or has financial commitments which he entered into before that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to contact with the child and the related special expenses. As my hon. Friends pointed out, we have all had cases concerning the Child Support Agency. In one such case recently, the absent parent told me that he saw his child regularly and was extremely generous to him but was nevertheless receiving a very heavy bill. That generosity must obviously be substantiated, but would it be reflected in this departure arrangement? I should have thought that it would be advantageous to
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
encourage the absent parent who has contact and sees the child regularly to be generous rather than to find himself no better off than if he had given the child hardly anything. That should be reflected somewhere in this arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about lifestyle and diversion of income is that it is an attempt to avoid proper responsibilities and payments and it is right that that should be stopped. The real point is whether it is deliberate. Some people may have invested money in a particular way because that is what they choose to do—premium bonds for example. The Child Support Agency should not say, "Well, you should have invested for a higher-yield income so that you can pay the child more." I am not altogether happy with that approach. The key point should be whether the diversion is deliberate. That is the relevant issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about appeals. Increasingly, higher penalties have been introduced for a mother—the parent with care in this case—who does not say who the father is. There may be all sorts of reasons for not saying who the father is. I correspond with the Child Support Agency and I hope to meet a representative in the near future to discuss the matter. In some cases, the agency decides whether the mother is telling the truth about whether she knows who the father is. That is unfair. A mother might genuinely not know who the father is, but the Child Support Agency in certain areas might choose not to believe her. In all such cases, the mother should have a right of appeal before stringent benefit cuts are introduced—she should have the right to take the case to a tribunal. There is a danger of people being treated differently in different areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerry Sutcliffe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee should welcome the broad aspects of the departures under discussion this afternoon, although the Child Support Agency causes me a great deal of anxiety.

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right: we do not have time because of the number of cases. In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen), I will meet the Child Support Agency soon to discuss my many worries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important factor is the discretion in the departures, as mentioned by the Minister, but allied to that is sensitivity. I should like the Minister to assure me that the proposals will be enacted with sensitivity, that there will be no problems with staffing levels in the agency, and that there will be staff who will recognise and acknowledge worries about sensitivity and support as well as the impact that the agency has on people's lives. All Members of Parliament witness that at their surgeries. I want to be assured that this move to provide discretion—a move in the right direction—will be handled sensitively and will be adequately supported by the agency being able to deliver so that we do not experience the delays that we did in the past.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
If it takes 12 months to make an assessment, we do not want the arrears suddenly to land at someone's door without any sensitivity. Although I welcome today's proposals, I hope that the Minister will continue to work, as I know that he has on an individual basis, to ensure that the Child Support Agency improves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a thoughtful and interesting debate and I will try to answer all the points that have been raised. I undertake to write to any Committee member whose points I do not deal with during my reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the views and remarks of the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Wicks). I know that he will not thank me for saying so, but the proposals represent a bipartisan approach to child support. I know that the hon. Gentleman has reservations about several aspects of the Child Support Agency's operations, but I read his party's report on the future of child support with great care and I must say that, apart from considering changing the name to the Child Maintenance Agency, there was not much to suggest any fundamental reform. I welcome that because, as the Child Support Agency beds down, it is important that there is wide agreement across the House about its aims. I will discuss the opinion of the Liberal Democrats in a minute, but it is important that the main Opposition party and the Government share this approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wicks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sensitive to the Minister's praise. I have no doubt that there might be an opportunity on the Floor of the House before too long to discuss child support policies in more strategic terms. Our policy represents a fundamental reform in several respects and my interpretation of Labour party policy might be at least as interesting as the Minister's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentlemen's sensitivity. If my hon. Friends trawl carefully through the Labour party's document—although I would not encourage them to do that—they will see that there is much agreement between the Government and the Opposition about the future of child support. The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West was right to point out that the Child Support Agency intervenes at a difficult time in people's lives and that it may have a controversial relationship with the people with whom it is involved. The departure proposals will further refine the workings of the Child Support Agency and inject fairness into cases where, as a result of the formula's operations, fairness may have been lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must commend to Members of the Committee what I believe was the first documentary to be made about the Child Support Agency. It was made by the BBC and was called "Misconceptions". It was most interesting—it showed the great difficulties that the CSA faces and how it grapples with them, and it emphasised how important its work is in relation to the future of social policy in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
The hon. Member for Croydon, North-West talked about "fairness", which, for the Child Support Agency, involves ensuring, for the child's sake, that maintenance is fairly divided between what the mother, the father and the taxpayer can contribute. In certain hard cases the formula is too inflexible, but the departure system will add the necessary flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned our debate earlier this year about the pilot scheme. We have learned the importance of piloting the proposals—doing so will ensure that we can anticipate the way that the full scheme will operate. That has not always been done with the Child Support Agency. We carried out the pilot scheme because we have learnt the importance of getting it right from the earliest moment and before the scheme goes live across the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first substantive Question of the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West was about low take-up. I must stress that I am not surprised by any of the take-up figures from the pilot scheme. However, the hon. Gentleman was wrong to say that there was cherry-picking. An important part of our pilot scheme involved inviting everyone who was a client of the CSA and who lived around the Hastings office to seek a departure. I cannot be sure whether the level will remain the same when the system goes live. Research has shown that there are several reasons for lower-than-expected take-up at the pilot stage: there was, of course, no immediate financial gain for any of those who applied, there may have been an unwillingness in some cases to disturb the existing arrangements and some people may have been unwilling to co-operate with the Child Support Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We included about 260 specially identified cases in the pilot scheme. Those cases, which hon. Members had drawn to my attention or to that of the Child Support Agency, constituted only a small proportion of the overall take-up. We were keen to ensure that they were included in the pilot scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Croydon, North-West and for Leyton—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wicks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on I must ask him about those figures, which involved the Hastings sample and some special cases. He said that those special cases constituted a small proportion of the total figure, but did they involve a small proportion of successful applicants? There may have been only 225 successful applicants. Were many of those applicants special cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I am incorrect in my response, which I will give off the top of my head, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman. My understanding is that that was not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second substantive point that the hon. Gentleman raised was about lifestyles and evidence requirements. His point was, in a sense, parried by the hon. Member for Leyton and picked up again by the hon. Member for Rochdale. The burden of proof in such cases must rest with the applicant. People will make claims for departures that are vexatious because they are not valid. I hope that staff in the agency will—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
through their training, as a result of the pilot scheme and from their experience—successfully identify such cases at a fairly early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cases will be dealt with initially by the independent tribunal service, which will decide what evidence is required. A formula cannot deliver a just solution in these circumstances. Exercise of discretion is extremely important. There must be some evidence that there is a legitimate case to be considered, but the evidence need not be conclusive. In reaching a decision, any tribunal will need to reach a balanced judgment based on written and oral evidence. The fact that a parent with care has no direct or written evidence to substantiate her claim should not automatically mean that she should be refused a departure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady allow me to finish? I had the opportunity of discussing the issue with Mr. Justice John Fogarty from the family courts of Australia. The hon. Gentleman may be aware that he designed and implemented a similar system in Australia. I told him that we wanted a discretionary element to operate in the child support system and I asked him how to handle the sort of cases that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. He said that his experience and judgment supported our plans—that discretion should be given to the independent people who comprise the independent tribunal service. He summarised his view in this way: if it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it is a duck. It is for the independent tribunal service to determine whether, on balance of the evidence before it, it is right for a departure to be given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can wider evidence be put before the tribunal or Child Support Agency, or will it be decided solely on the basis of evidence—or lack of it—from the parent with care?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The CSA officers will consider what evidence is adduced. It may be insufficient to be taken beyond the initial sift. In that event, an appeal can be made to the tribunal by the parent who is applying for a departure. To that extent, some steering will be given. However, I cannot commit the agency to taking on wider investigations. People who believe that there is clear evidence in support of their claim for departure must present it and allow the independent tribunal service to exercise its judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, after the initial stages, it is established that there is a case to be answered, will the absent parent be given an opportunity to explain his lifestyle and circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is at the tribunal that such evidence will be considered. I stress that such cases as described by the hon. Gentleman will be dealt with by the tribunal as a whole—not only by the tribunal chairman but by all three of its members. That adds an element of flexibility, which, as decided in the 1995 Act, is important for reaching an appropriate solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the sift should occur before a case reaches the tribunal. If someone makes an allegation, it should be considered by the Child Support Agency to decide whether there is a prima facie case to be answered. It is here that a person should be given the opportunity to explain his lifestyle and to respond to allegations. Only then, if the criteria have not been satisfied, should the matter be put before the tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman some comfort on that point. The tribunal will be able to call for further evidence—either from the parent with care or from the absent parent. The tribunal will be aware of issues in the light of informed debate from both sides of the argument, as the hon. Gentleman wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme told us that she received an unsatisfactory response when she rang the Child Support Agency about fraud. The Child Support Agency is not responsible for tackling fraud. It may identify prospective fraud but the fraud arm of the Department of Social Security is the Benefits Agency. I assure the hon. Lady that, whenever fraud is suspected, cases are immediately passed on to the Benefits Agency for action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A pilot study was set up in one of the country's six CSA centres to ensure that the link between the CSA and the Benefits Agency in pursuit of fraud is effective and informed. There may have been a misunderstanding about the role of the CSA. That agency is not technically responsible for investigating fraud, but it has a duty to pass relevant information to the Benefits Agency for investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Golding</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arrangement is unsatisfactory when the mother receives no maintenance because the husband is supposed to be on income support.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most satisfactory way to end this discussion is for the hon. Lady to let me examine the case and provide her with an explanation of what has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Rochdale asked a number of questions, one of which related to the frequency of visits and contact. It is important to make it clear that the Child Support Agency is not responsible for determining contact. It is for the courts to deal with such matters. Many people believe that the Child Support Agency should take a view in that regard, but the courts must make the decision in the agonising circumstances that obtain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Lynne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, is the Minister saying that the Child Support Agency gives no guidance about the number of visits that will be taken into account for any departure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is to be hoped that there will be agreement between the absent parent and the parent with care about the level of contact. However, if there is not, it is for the courts to decide on the level of contact, not the Child Support Agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The hon. Member of Rochdale also asked about the take-on of cases and how long decisions will take. We shall stagger the take-on of cases to ensure that problems with making decisions do not arise. Clearly, awards need to go through the evidence collection and contest stage, in which the other party has an opportunity to comment. That will take about 10 to 12 weeks, but cases referred to the independent tribunal service will take longer, as will cases where there is an outstanding review of the underlying maintenance assessment. However, the agency will have a clearance target, which we shall publish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to compensation, we reviewed the matter earlier this year and announced that an independent complaints examiner will be appointed. In addition, the hon. Lady will know of the compensation schemes run by the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leyton wanted me to comment on the specific case of a constituent of his who, having been generous to the child of a former partner, has ended up with a huge bill. The practice in such circumstances is firmly established. If that generosity is the payment of basic maintenance, the rules of the agency mean that such payment can be credited to the amount of weekly maintenance that should be paid, as long as that is agreed between the two parties. However, if the generosity consists not of maintenance but of treats given by an absent parent to a child, payment for such treats should not come before payment of basic maintenance. That is a clearly established agency rule, with which I hope the hon. Gentleman agrees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about diversion, and whether premium bonds should be regarded as a non-performing asset. The discretion in the departure system allows the tribunal to assess whether such a diversion is deliberate. It can also determine whether it is fair for that proportion of a person's income or assets to take that form, or whether it is a form of avoidance that means that a departure should be awarded under the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for good cause and reduced benefits, the Select Committee has examined that matter and there is wide agreement in the House that the good cause provisions in the past have been abused. We are satisfied that those provisions protect the people who need protection, but it is clear that they go further than that.
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
That is why we have introduced changes. The Select Committee has asked that we keep those changes under review so that we can be sure that they have caused the loophole to be closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is adequate protection. People need not suffer a reduced benefit direction; if they cooperate and explain why they have good cause, I am sure that good cause will be granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe) asked for a commitment about staffing levels and training. Those are very important matters. The pilot has enabled us to confirm that staffing levels are adequate, and that there is flexibility if levels of work are greater or less than anticipated. Training has also been refined as a result of the pilot study. Although we shall keep both matters under review, I am satisfied that there is not a problem with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I inquired earlier about the extent to which the Minister has advisory or absolute powers in respect of the administrative procedures pursued by the agency.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Gentleman I should have commented on the important point that he raised. The rules governing the Child Support Agency's management state that the chief executive is responsible for its day-to-day administration, while Ministers are responsible to Parliament for policy concerning the agency. I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is a close relationship between the policy-making Ministers and the agency's chief executive. While I have been the Minister with daily responsibility for the agency, I have made about 100 changes in policy and administration. The hon. Gentleman can be sure that the close relationship that he wants between Minister and chief executive is in operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
