	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for The Environment (Mr. Kenneth Marks)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Grants to Redundant Churches Fund Order 1979.</p></blockquote>
The Redundant Churches Fund is jointly financed by the Church of England and the Department of the Environment under the Redundant Churches and Other Religious Buildings Act 1969. Its task is to preserve churches of historic or architectural interest which are no longer in ecclesiastical use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are just at the end of the second of the five-year periods. Under the Act, a single sum is allocated in advance for payment as needed. There is no provision for increases during the quinquennium. The two previous orders appear to have worked extremely well, so we are retaining this arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fund has operated economically. I am told that every penny has been spent, which I am sure is an example to many people who have given money for the carrying out of good works. Despite inflation during the period, the fund has largely contained the effects of that inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fund publishes an annual report which gives some idea of the way in which churches have been helped. Many of those churches date back to the twelfth century. It is for the sake of the nation, as well as the Church, that those buildings are being preserved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past five years the fund was given a maximum provision of £1,750,000, of which £700,000 came from my Department, £700,000 from the Church Commissioners, and £350,000 from the sale of redundant churches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the next five years a ceiling of £2.9 million has been agreed between the Department and the Church Commissioners and, of course, the Treasury. I should
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
explain that the Minister in the Department who dealt with these matters on a daily basis was Lady Birk, but it is now Baroness Stedman. Ministerial agreement was given to that arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument that we are now considering was laid in draft, and an order has also been laid by the Church Commissioners to obtain authority to make their payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the only way in which churches can be preserved. There are other grants for redundant churches. Clearly, it is impossible for this fund to cater for all redundant churches. Sometimes it is necessary for an alternative use to be found for a building. In some areas the Church itself lays great emphasis on keeping churches in use, if not for the purpose of worship, certainly for social reasons. Grants can be made under section 4 of the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953 if a building is of outstanding interest in its own right or if it forms part of an outstanding group. Help can also be provided under section 10 of the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act 1972 if a building is in an outstanding conservation area and the work would contribute to the enhancement or preservation of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since August 1977 grants have been available under section 4 of the Historic-Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953 towards the cost of repairs to buildings of outstanding architectural interest which are still in use for public worship. It is interesting that for the two financial years 1977–78 and 1978–79, a total of £1.1 million was set aside for that purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.34 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William van Straubenzee</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this one occasion I am deputed to speak for the Opposition. It is a moment of greatness in my life. I say that because, as you, Mr. Davies, and members of the Committee know, I am a Church Commissioner. Therefore, in that sense I have to declare an interest. But I shall be careful not to say anything in my few remarks from the Church Commissioners angle, because we are fortunate to have present the Second Church Estates Commissioner, the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Walker). If he should catch your eye, Mr. Davies, he will speak with far greater authority than I can from the Church Commissioners point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I rise simply to welcome the proposals in the order and to suggest that it is a remarkable example of co-operation between Church and State. The established Church clearly has a large number of buildings, many of which are loved by members of Churches other than the Church of England and by those who would not wish to belong to any Church. Therefore, the preservation of these buildings, where there is no alternative use, is, I suggest, a national matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State, to whom I am obliged for introducing this matter rightly drew attention to the fact that the Church likes to find a living use for these buildings, if possible, but it is not always possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other comment 1 wish to make, since the Under-Secretary rightly touched upon it, concerns an important and interesting extension of his Department's interest in churches in use. 1 remind the Committee that that provision extends outside the Church of England. Grants have been made to a Jewish synagogue and to a Roman Catholic church, as is right and proper in a society such as ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those few words, I warmly welcome the Minister's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.36 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Second Church Estates Commissioner, I should like to say how grateful the Commissioners are to the Government for once again entering into this spirit of co-operation which we believe is essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the last war more and more churches have fallen into disuse. There are many reasons for this. One of the main reasons has been the movement of population. People have tended more and more to move out of large cities into the countryside and, in turn, the parts of the countryside have become large dormitory areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the war it was found that many churches were in the wrong places. For example, in Bristol, many beautiful churches fell into disuse because people moved out, the centre of Bristol having been devastated by bombs during the war. The churches were needed in the new areas of Hartcliffe and Brentry, and in my own areas, Kingswood, which became a small town where previously these had been only green fields and a few cows and farm animals. It is now completely built up. That has meant that new churches have had to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
be built. But we could not forsake the beautiful churches in the city which had done a first-class job for many hundreds of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the burden providing new churches has fallen upon the Church Commissioners. We have tried as far as possible over the years to provide them, but it has meant that old, established, historical buildings in Bristol and many other centres of population throughout the country have fallen into disuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Under-Secretary of State and the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) mentioned that the Church Commissioners try as far as possible to find a living use for these buildings. Many buildings, which have been closed under pastoral measures and reorganisation, have passed to living use within the community—for example, for the arts and for community centres. One church in the city of Bournemouth was used as a medieval banqueting hall, but I understand from the news last weekend that it has met a premature end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Church Commissioners are concerned that, when a building passes to living use, there are a restricted number of uses for it. Such buildings reach the stage where they cannot be used for anything else, and it is for these buildings that the measure is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spirit of co-operation between the State and the Church, which I hope will continue for many years, is shown in the measure. I understand that the £2.9 million which will have to be spent will be dealt with on a two-way split between the Commissioners and the State. Therefore, the measure will be widely welcomed. The preservation of historic churches is in the interests not only of church people and those who have grown to love these buildings over the years, but of the nation, because it is important that these monuments are maintained for the use of everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In welcoming the measure, I reiterate how grateful we are to the Government for coming forward with it. I am sure that it will be welcomed by all members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.41 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jim Callaghan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to seek information. I wholeheartedly welcome the measure. Prior to becoming a member of the House of Commons, I earned my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
living by lecturing on historic buildings, particularly those of an ecclesiastical nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The preamble to the order reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State for the Environment, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 1(1) and (2) of the Redundant Churches and Other Religious Buildings Act 1969".</p></blockquote>
I am concerned with other religious buildings. In Manchester there is a synagogue built in the style of Spanish synagogue. At present it is unused, the Jewish population having moved away to better areas of the city. However, it is a religious building gem which should not be allowed to fall into disrepair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the order cover synagogues as well as churches? I have a copy of the "Redundant Churches Fund Ninth Annual Report 1977". In the list of ecclesiastical buildings receiving assistance for maintenance, I do not see a synagogue. Will the Minister clarify whether synagogues and other religious buildings are included in this fund?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.44 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the remarks that have been made by hon. Members. We felt that on this occasion there should be a straight fifty-fifty contribution from the Church Commissioners and the Government rather than the two-two-one arrangement—40 per cent, from the Government, 40 per cent, from the Church Commissioners and 20 per cent, from redundant church sales—because we do not know what the future sales of redundant churches may bring. I imagine that there will be a drop after the first 10 years of operation of the Act so we have decided to make it a straight fifty-fifty contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood (Mr. Walker). These buildings concern not only Church of England people, but all of us. I am sure that when we visit other countries or other towns in this country we are interested to look around and, if we have any sense of history, almost the first building we visit will be the local church, especially if it is old.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We take an interest in such buildings. Under another hat I am concerned about the countryside and, to some extent, tourism. Therefore, I know of the great architectural value of these buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Middleton and Prestwich (Mr. Callaghan) asked whether a synagogue might qualify for grant. I know the building to which he referred and agree with him that it is very fine. It looks so good still that I had not realised that it was not in use. The order relates only to Church of England churches under the 1969 Act. Nevertheless, as the hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. van Straubenzee) pointed out, Government grants are available for such buildings under the listed buildings arrangements. We could examine other ways of giving help. In discussions later with my hon. Friend, I shall consider whether we can give some help to the specific building that he mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Cormack</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order that we are discussing this morning is working tolerably well, and everybody deserves credit for that. Last year the Church Commissioners mounted an exhibition called "A Measure of Success". That carefully chosen title indicated that all was not entirely as it might be. I realise that it does not fall exactly within the scope of the order, but I should like to make a brief point which I am sure the Minister will take on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a church is declared redundant, it can cither be vested in the fund—which means that it is put into mothballs and the church remains for people to see as a religious building—or it can be converted to alternative uses. Sometimes that can be an entirely appropriate solution and very suitable. If neither of those alternatives is appropriate, it has to be demolished. Many people who are concerned about religious buildings do not like that third possibility because of its starkness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to one building that is giving me some cause for anxiety—the incomparably beautiful Gilbert Scott building, All Souls, Haley Hill, Halifax. By any standards, that church is a supreme example of ecclesiastical architecture. By many people's standards, it was the finest church building erected in the nineteenth century. That is, of course, a subjective analysis. But All Souls, Haley Hill, partly because of the chemical interaction between the two stones of which it was built, has been a constant problem from the point of view of decay almost since it was erected. There are enormous difficulties facing local people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
As the matter stands, if there is no suitable alternative use—it is not difficult to see that it might not be possible to find an alternative use—and if it cannot be vested in the fund—there would be a significant drain upon the resources of the fund to maintain such an enormous church —demolition is the only alternative. But I think that building deserves, and I hope it will be given, very special consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am about to suggest would not be appropriate for All Souls. For many of our smaller country churches, ruination—in other words, taking the roof off but allowing the structure to stand—is to many people a much more aesthetically acceptable solution than demolition. It also provides the long-term alternative of restoration at some later date. A movement of population might bring back the need for a church in the area, and it could be brought back into use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that those points merit very serious consideration. I do not wish to sound churlish in my welcome of this measure and my gratitude to the Government for what they have done—indeed, there has been "A Measure of Success"—but I suggest that the third possibility of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
destruction is not greeted with universal acclamation. The supreme building to which I have referred underlines the inevitable deficiencies of a system such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Marks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the two Church Commissioners who have listened to the hon. Gentlemen's comments will have taken note of them. The Church Commissioners decide which churches should benefit from the fund. I am sure that they will also consider his suggestion of deliberate or organised ruination of churches, although I am not sure that I liked that suggestion very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that All Souls, Haley Hill, was under consideration for grant. I am not sure what the result was, but we and the Church Commissioners have taken note of what the hon. Gentlemen said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
