	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Theresa May 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Maidenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That the Committee has considered the Education (Budget Statements and Supplementary Provisions) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 486).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pleasure to serve on a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson. I believe that it is the first time that I have done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are the result of provisions in the School Standards and Framework Act 1988 that require local education authorities before the start of the financial year to prepare a budget statement and to make the information in that budget statement available to certain parties. The Act provides for the Secretary of State to introduce regulations to specify to whom and how that budget statement should be made available. Although the requirement is reiterated in regulation 8, the Act provides that a copy of the budget statement should be sent to the governing body and head teacher of every school in the local education authority area. The regulations specify that the budget statement shall be supplied to the Secretary of State in certain forms and that a copy should be made available at the offices of the local education authority so that parents and others who wish to refer to it can do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no problem with the concept of ensuring that information in available to parents, teachers and governors about what local authorities are doing with their education budget, how much of the overall education budget is being spent on schools and how much is being delegated to schools to use as they wish. It is necessary to make information available to parents and others, and accountability is important so that parents, teachers and governors can see what local education authorities are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am worried about the proposals described in the regulations. Accountability is aided by clarity and simplification. It is important for parents, teachers and governors to know how much their council spends on local schools. The regulations specify that there should be four parts to such budget statements, which take up 21 pages of tables and notes. Even those 21 pages do not specify everything that someone must know to interpret the figures. For example, in 1.2.1.1, on page 6, under the heading "Notes to part 1" and the sub-heading "Strategic Management", in relation to a particular row of the table, the regulations state:
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Enter here all planned expenditure deducted in accordance with paragraph 25 except sub-paragraph (k) and paragraphs 27, 32 and 37 of Schedule 1 and any other expenditure falling within paragraph 25(e) to (g) of that Schedule."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Phil Willis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrogate and Knaresborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite simple.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman thinks that it is quite simple. I look forward to his explaining exactly what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I look through all 21 pages of notes and tables, I could not find any references to paragraph 25, sub-paragraph (k), paragraphs 27, 32 and 37 of schedule 1 or paragraphs (25)(e) to (g) of that schedule. Presumably, therefore, anyone who wants to understand what that row of the table means must read not only the notes to the tables but further documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impression is given that, although the intention is claimed to be ensuring that parents and others have access to information about what the local education authority is doing in budgetary terms, there is a danger that the regulations are so complicated that they will obscure the truth about spending on schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People must be able to see what their LEA is spending on schools, and parents, governors and teachers in particular need a clear statement of expenditure. Some people will wish to look at detailed figures and they should be available, but I hope that the Government will ask LEAs to consider making such a simplified statement on expenditure available to parents, governors and teachers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Simplified statements would set out the amount of money allocated to the LEA in the standard spending assessment for education—the amount that the authority has chosen to put into its education budget for schools and the amount spent at school level. In other words, it is not the amount held back by the LEA but the amount that schools get in their hands to spend on the education of children in the classroom. It is important that those simple, clear figures are available so that the LEA is accountable and can be questioned by parents and others on the budget that it has set and on what it is doing in regard to schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information required by the regulations should also be given to schools and to those involved in education in good time. Although the 1998 Act provides that that should occur prior to the start of the financial year, look as I may, I find no reference in the regulations to a final date for setting out the information to those who require it. Obviously, schools also need that information as soon as possible so that they can consider what is to be provided in part 4 of the budget statement, under schedule 4. They would then be able to examine their position relative to the authority as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the start of this financial year, some schools found that their LEA was unable to set indicative budgets until a late stage because the Government had not decided how much money was to be allocated to LEAs, particularly in regard to the standards fund. The fund is one of the items on the form of part 1 of a budget statement as set out in schedule 1. Information needs to be made available as soon as possible to schools, so that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
they can make planning and strategic decisions about their budgets for the following year, but also to those in the locality about the decisions taken by the LEA. It does not need to be complicated information that appears to obscure the truth on what is happening on spending in schools. Too much money is held at the centre by the Government and is not being passed down to LEAs and schools. In their turn, too many LEAs are not passing down money to schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I agree with the concept of making that information available to parents, governors and teachers, I hope that the Government will ensure that it is provided in a readily accessible and simple form for those people who do not want to go into the intricate detail set out in the 21 pages of tables and notes before us. People could then see immediately what the Government think the LEA should spend, how much it is spending on schools and how much is being passed to the schools themselves. I fear that the regulations are too complicated and that the Government need to look again at ensuring clear information is available to those who are interested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.39 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Mr. Charles Clarke)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the hon. Lady's pleasure at being under you chairmanship, Mr. Stevenson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) has no problem with the concept of ensuring transparency and accountability by making information available about every school and every local education authority in the country. It is a shame that the previous Government, who had no problem with the concept, did not put it into practice, which is what we are trying to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked to whom the information will be made available. That is set out clearly in regulations 5 and 8. Regulation 5 provides that a copy should go to the Secretary of State, and that a copy is made available for
	<br><blockquote><p>"parents and other persons at all reasonable times and without charge at each education office of the authority."</p></blockquote>
Regulation 8 provides that the authority
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall furnish the governing body and head teacher of each school maintained by them with a copy of Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the budget statement".</p></blockquote>
That is a substantial coverage. The information will be widely available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also asked when the information would be made available. Regulation 7(1) states categorically that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a budget statement shall be published before the beginning of the financial year to which it relates."</p></blockquote>
That will normally be before March 31, which is the end of the previous financial year. That is in good time. The hon. Lady spoke also about the need for the LEA to make information, including about the standards fund, available to schools during March or well before then. Those points were well made, and the Government will take steps to ensure that that happens. The regulations make it absolutely clear that a budget statement will be published before the beginning of the financial year to which it relates. That is clear and unequivocal, as required by the Act—and as would be required by anyone with an interest in what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
The hon. Lady then asked a series of questions about the clarity of the information. Before responding I shall make a general comment. In preparing the format and content of the statements, the Department was advised by a technical working group comprising representatives of LEAs, the grant-maintained sector, the Funding Agency for Schools, the Audit Commission, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy and various other interested organisations. Many of those expert bodies are deeply committed, in practice and in theory, to making such information available clearly and transparently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On page 10 of the regulations, in schedule 2, we have printed what I hope the hon. Lady will concede is a simple form. For each LEA, and for every school in the area, it sets out the amount of money available to that school, the formula budget, the national special educational needs budget and the budget share per school and per pupil. From that straightforward form, anyone can see how much money is available for each school, how that compares with other schools in the locality and whether the budgets are fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the hon. Lady said about long notes on schedules—it is a perfectly legitimate debating point—but we want to allow information on LEAs to be comparable. We also want the information to be computer compatible, so that we can analyse it. It is therefore important to specify the precise form of the data to be rendered by the LEA and the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the specification for collating that information was not clear, the hon. Lady would be the first to complain—rightly so—that it could be susceptible to misinterpretation. That is why we established the technical working group; we wanted to ensure that the information would be comparable. The charge that the information is not clear is refuted by reference to the table in schedule 2 to the regulations; and the charge that the appendices are complicated is refuted by the fact that we want to ensure that the information is comparable between all LEAs. If we do not specify detail and precision, many people might try to present data in ways that would hide what was going on. Our intention is to ensure that the information is transparent and available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 4 sets out the three key items of information that we will require to be published. Part 1 of the budget statement will be the authority's planned expenditure for the financial year, in which all the data to which the hon. Lady referred will be published so that everyone can be sure about the state of affairs. It will show what is going on in detail, how much money has been held back and how much has gone to schools. It is fair to say that this will be the first time that such quality of information will be published, and I am glad that we can honour the concept for which the hon. Lady is looking by doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part 2 will be the planned expenditure for each school, so the information that the hon. Lady is looking for will be present. Part 3 is the authority's allocation formula. I acknowledge to the hon. Lady, whose numeracy is excellent, unlike that of some of her hon. Friends, that some of the issues around the allocation formula are complicated as authorities work out on exactly which basis they allocate money to which schools. We think that it is important, and I hope that the hon. Lady agrees, that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0090">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
information on the criteria and co-efficients of the allocation between schools should be in the public domain so that people can understand the situation. That is why we asked for that to be specified. We could have simplified matters by leaving out part 3 altogether. It is a complicated piece of information; perhaps she would have preferred it to have not been in the public domain, but it is pretty important that it is, like all the other information present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted that the hon. Lady had no problem with the concepts of transparency and accountability, and that the Government have been able to introduce in the regulations the practicality of that concept. Every interested person—every governor, head teacher, parent and citizen—can know what is being spent on local schools and can draw appropriate conclusions. That is yet another indication of our commitment to open government in a way that ensures that all information is available to those who are interested. I hope that, when it comes to it, the hon. Lady will give her support to the regulations, which put that principle into practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.47 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to be in line with what has been said so far, Mr. Stevenson. We too have no principled objections to accountability in terms of what local authorities and schools spend or the fact that there will be transparency over the whole process. However, I must say that the Minister has made a brave job of saying that that is simple. I spent a couple of hours with an experienced finance director from my local authority who struggled with the information. The Minister may say that that is because it is new, and I understand that. The fact that costs are being apportioned for the first time is difficult, and I am pretty sure that in years to come it will be much easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it is good that schools know where they stand and where the money has been spent. I can remember the days, as I am sure can many more experienced members of the Committee, of largesse by local authorities when it was difficult to get a handle on such figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that parents could understand the figures unless they had a qualification from the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. That is what someone would need to understand the regulations. I am not talking about the formulas; it is right and proper that those who want to consider the formulas should be able to do so, and I complement the Government for including that as a requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is control of budgets rather than accountability that the Government are after. The drive for accountability hides their desire to make sure that every local authority in the country will be denuded of its individual responsibilities and will fit into a pattern that they set down. For instance, schedule 1 on page 4 contains a section on strategic management. I can tell the Committee exactly what will happen to that. I would be grateful if the Minister said this afternoon that the Secretary of State
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
was right in saying that that area of budgets will be capped. If that is true, we should be told that, if LEAs exceed their budgets and do not fit into the formula that is set by the Government, they will be capped. I look forward to the Minister's response to that specific point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that, irrespective of whether a local education authority is a large shire area such as Yorkshire or a small urban authority such as Stockport, the same criteria will apply. I am sure that the Minister will agree that that is not reasonable. Local education authorities have different central costs, according to their geography and the way in which schools need support. League tables will be the consequence of this measure. They will be compared category by category and LEA by LEA. The next rout will be about which authorities are performing badly on centrally set criteria, rather than what is determined by locally elected representatives. I wonder what was the point of last Thursday's local elections. Perhaps that is why so few people bothered to turn out. Will the Minister say whether the Government intend to publish league tables of local authorities step by step and stage by stage? If so, there will be prescription.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that none of this information, even though it is available to his Department, will be published until after the European elections? Is that because certain authorities are performing extremely badly and that such information would be especially damaging?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to schedule 2. As a head teacher, I used to be very anxious to see what other schools were doing. Leeds local education authority, which was Labour controlled, always produced that information. I received it every year, so I knew what every other school in the authority provided. I defy members of the Cornmittee to say that their local authority did not do exactly the same. If it was only Leeds LEA, I compliment it on doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two items missing form the statement. The first is the standards fund. The Government have no mandate for this, but they hold back significant amounts of central expenditure to spend as they want, where they want, as a result of the bidding process, under the terms of the standards fund. My constituency has done extremely well from the standards fund, the capital fund and the early-years fund for building new classrooms. I am grateful for that, but the information should be published. I think that schools want to see who benefits from such funding; it is important for schools to know that they are being treated equitably by their local authorities and the Government. Perhaps the Minister will say why that information is not in schedule 2. I am sure that there is a perfectly logical explanation, but I cannot think of one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Asset management, which has been delegated to schools, will be a major issue for all local authorities in the future. Although I have some problems with that, especially for small rural primary schools, which do not want it, the reality is that the LEA will be accountable for asset management within the authority. Will the Minister say how those things are reconcilable, if he feels that that comes within his overall brief?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been made. It is important not to talk down parents. Many parents are entirely capable of understanding provisions such as schedule 2. They understand what the issues are and how to draw out the information that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough (Mr. Willis), but it is important that we do even more to explain the position to parents. Without giving any commitment, we are considering how better and clearer information on schools' budgets can be given in governors' annual reports. I hope that we shall introduce proposals to achieve that later in the year. Having said that, parents can easily look at the information contained in schedule 2 and draw out the figures that they want. I agree that not many parents have suitable qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall reiterate what I said in response to a point made by the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May). Regulation 6 refers to supplying budget statements
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the form of machine readable data on a floppy disc".</p></blockquote>
We provide substantial accompanying guidance to LEAs, which have to calculate the data and collect the information. Hon. Members have been given copies of that guidance. We have issued that guidance because we must receive the data in comparable form so that people can understand and use it. That is why it will be computer readable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough is right to say that many authorities, such as Leeds, have produced such information, they have often done so in ways that are not directly comparable. That is why it is important to have a measure that sets out such matters directly. We all know that it is difficult to compare statistics for different areas that have been produced in slightly different ways. The regulations are intended to establish transparency and comparability. The result is a simple table that parents, governors and teachers can understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough made a point about strategic management. The Government have made it clear that, in June, we will publish comparative tables of LEA expenditure so that people can make judgments about how LEAs operate. We have made no statement on capping, but we are anxious to put the information into the public arena. The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways; he cannot say that, on the one hand, local authorities need the resources to intervene strategically, but on the other hand, he does not want them to provide the data that show what is happening in different authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough asked about the publication date. Like all Departments, the Department for Education and Employment is under an embargo until the European elections have taken place. No such information will be published in the immediate run-up to the European elections. That embargo has been set across Government, not by politicians, but under the civil service codes that apply before elections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information will be published because people should know how LEAs are doing, so that comparisons and judgments can be made. For what it is worth, I accept
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
that some LEAs have more strategic responsibility than others, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough said. That is an obvious point, and I am sure that people will take it into account when they look at the tables and form their judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have a right to form those judgments; such matters should not be shrouded in a cloud of information that is too difficult for anyone to understand. Under the regulations, the information will be placed in the public arena so that people can debate the issues, make judgments and understand how LEAs address their important strategic and other responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough made a fair point about the standards fund. Information on that fund will be included in row 1.3.1 of table 1, an example of which can be in schedule 1.I would hope that that information could be included in schedule 2. In fact, schools have received the information at different times for a variety of reasons. In some cases, that has been the Department's fault; we have not taken the decisions early enough. In other cases, it has been the fault of LEAs; they have not taken decisions at the right time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that we shall be able to include figures on the standard fund in further columns in table 2, shown in schedule 2, as the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough suggests. I agree that that would aid transparency and public debate. As he knows, many schools have received large amounts of money from the standard funds, which have made a material difference to how they have operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities have undertaken how they have delegated and what they have delegated in different ways. We have set out different specifications along the standards fund lines and they need to be put into a more coherent form before they can be dealt with under schedule 2 in the way in which the hon. Gentleman wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Under-Secretary agree that there should be a column for capital? Both the Government and the LEA put money into capital development?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a worthwhile point, but I shall deal with it in the context of asset management plans. It is important that every local education authority takes a coherent approach to the management of assets. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we have given resources to LEAs to enable them to develop their plans properly, to plan assets and ensure that they get maximum use out of them. That is an LEA asset management plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas we have also tried to allocate capital to individual schools. For example, in this year's ACG grant, for the first time in some years, we were able to give a specific allocation to each school to help with repairs and maintenance. Currently, the responsibility for managing assets lies with the LEA and we want a process whereby the LEA manages assets properly through proper asset management plans.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough knows, we have a consultation document on capital planning. Some of the matters raised for discussion in that document suggest a desire for us to move to a system in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
which more capital is controlled directly by the schools to enable them to deal with the position as they move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the result of 18 years of Tory misrule, many schools have serious under-investment. Our new deal budgets are trying to attack those problems. At present, we are trying to raise the poorer local authority areas to achieve a level playing field. Until we have done that, we cannot deal directly with schools without the role of the LEA. I agree that the provision of information about capital spending would be of general benefit and I shall certainly take into account what was said by the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.2 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed the Under-Secretary's spirited defence of the regulations. It was a great pity, however, that he did not listen more carefully to what I said. He said that the information was made widely available, which I accept. I said how important it is that information is made available to parents, teachers and governors to enable them to know what is happening in local schools. I talked about the timing of information and the Under-Secretary said that the budget statement must be published before 31 March. However, it could be published at lunch time on 31 March and, because no revision of the budget statement would be possible thereafter, no one can make representations about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the earlier information is made available, the better, and we are working to that end. Nevertheless, the final line beyond which we cannot go is the statutory line under the regulations. Many LEAS already provide information early—and the earlier, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's intervention and for making clear the Government's expectation that information should be issued as early as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about the simplicity of schedule 2 on page 10. I agree with the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough: it looks as though detailed knowledge of local authority finance would be necessary to make head or tail of the figures. The Minister referred to schedule 2 and said that it would contain all the information that parents wanted and explained how easy it would be to understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that it is probably the simplest of the tables, which is presumably why the Minister lighted on it. However, I was speaking not only about the budget for each school but saying that parents want to know how much money the Government believe local councils should spend on education, how much councils are
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
spending on education and how much of that money is going to the schools, so that they can decide how to spend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it is necessary for the Government to have detailed information on local authorities, so that they can ensure consistency. Consistency is important, as is being able to compare across authorities, and I do not argue against it. I am saying that the Government have missed an opportunity. Providing information is important, and accountability is important; but it is also important that that information should be easily accessible. People should be encouraged to look for it; they should not wonder when they first visit the LEA offices how to work out exactly what should be entered in column 1.2.1 of the table, or what the other tables are for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people will want to look at that detail, and it should be available, but I hope that the Government will not entirely miss the opportunity to encourage LEAs to make simplified figures available, so that everyone can see the clear picture. It would be nice if those figures included the amount of money being held back by central Government, which the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough referred to in some detail. People should be able to see what the local authority is expected to spend on education, what it actually spends on education and how much of that reaches the schools. It is a missed opportunity. I hope that the Government will not entirely miss it, but that they will take note of what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The information that the hon. Lady seeks is clearly set out in table 1 at lines 4, 5 and 1.1. I am happy to go on record as saying that we encourage LEAs to produce simplified information. Indeed, the more information the better. As I said in answer to her hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Harrogate and Knaresborough—I say that because it is a strategic alliance which seems to be working widely—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. May</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very widely, and certainly in the House. We want more information to be made available. I wish that the hon. Lady would be a little more generous in admitting that we are making progress on the path to transparency. We are, of course, ready to learn and to improve; but we are taking major steps and I hope that we can take the whole House with us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
