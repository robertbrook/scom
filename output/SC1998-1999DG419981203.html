	<div class='legislation'>Draft Forensic Science Service Trading Fund Order 1998</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Paul Boateng)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Forensic Science Service Trading Fund Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
I cannot begin to say how appropriate it is, Mrs. Roe, that my first Standing Committee as Minister of State at the Home Office should be under your chairmanship, bearing in mind the extensive knowledge of the subject that you showed when you sat on the Greater London council as the member for Broxbourne—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ilford North.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Ilford, North. You and I had many happy exchanges then on policing matters. I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forensic Science Service is in its 50th year. It is a world leader and an institution of which the country is entitled to be proud, not least for its pioneering work on deoxyribonucleic acid. The FSS became an executive agency of the Home Office on 1 April 1991 and is in business to serve the administration of justice. Its capital expenditure is included within the Home Office's overall cash-limited vote, which means that capital funds have to be allocated on the basis of Home Office priorities as a whole. As you can imagine, Mrs. Roe, that can be a disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trading Fund status will give the FSS greater flexibility when considering capital investment projects, such as research and development, and is designed to secure the long-term future of the FSS in an increasingly competitive market. It is right that it should be a competitive market, because, in those circumstances, the police, who are its main clients, are likely to get the best value for money. The effective use of resources unites both sides of the Committee, because we are determined to see our police well served. It is our view that the order will strengthen that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To help the FSS during its first year of operating as a trading fund, the Treasury has agreed to waive the dividend on its public dividend capital from the first year of trading; the FSS will declare a dividend from the second year of operating as a trading fund and will make good the dividend shortfall in subsequent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under trading fund arrangements, the chief executive will continue to be accountable to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Department for the management of the agency; the chief executive will also become an accounting officer and will therefore be responsible directly to the House. Accountability to the House, through my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and through the chief executive acting as accounting officer, is maintained— indeed, enhanced. The agency's annual reports and accounts will continue to be laid before the House and parliamentary control will be retained, the FSS having to meet certain financial targets set out in the Treasury minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are satisfied that the change in regime will bring important benefits for the FSS's customers, yet it will keep the FSS as an important part of the Home Office. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has concluded, and my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury agrees, that in the interests of improved efficiency and effective management, the FSS's operations should be financed by means of a trading fund. I, therefore, commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.34 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Greenway 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ryedale)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the comments of the Minister of state in welcoming the opportunity to debate such an important matter under your chairmanship, Mrs. Roe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 10 years ago this month, the Home Affairs Select Committee, of which I was a member, visited almost all the FSS laboratories as part of an in-depth inquiry into its future. You may wonder, Mrs. Roe, why that is relevant to our proceedings. It is extremely relevant for three reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, as the Minister said, our FSS is world renowned. Its reputation is second to none. The Select Committee started from that premise, but discovered that morale in the service was rather low. I shall not go so far as to say that it was rock bottom, but many things needed attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Select Committee had the foresight to recommend that the solution lay in granting the service executive agency status. I shall tease the Minister by reminding him that one or two of his colleagues who are still in the House profoundly disagreed, but things have since moved on. I am delighted that under its new arrangements the service is again thriving. The proposals are a natural extension of what the previous Government did and of the thoughts that I had when putting my name to the report in February 1989.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the reason for some Labour Members' taking exception to the proposal was their anxiety about the certainty of the funding that the FSS needs. Essentially, the mechanism now in operation is that police forces are charged for work that the service does on their behalf. That system has worked reasonably well because it enables police forces to value the work that the FSS does in all their investigations. The problem, if one exists, is the police service's ability to buy as much forensic science advice as it wishes, not the FSS's ability to respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding that fact, I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me about the new arrangements, if not today, perhaps later, in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The new arrangements liberalise the service from any restrictions that apply as part of the Government's capital financing limit. However, setting it free raises the question of whether its resources will be adequate not only to continue its day-to-day activities, supporting the police and other organisations in their investigative work, but to fund the research programmes on which so much of its renowned leading-edge scientific technology is based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to that caveat only, Conservative Members on this occasion—I cannot say what may happen when I face the Minister in future—heartily concur with what the Government are doing. It is the right approach and constitutes an important further step along the road, on which the previous Government started, to improving the quality of the scientific and investigative research and support given to our police service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.39 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the hon. Gentleman's constructive approach. As a former serving police officer in the Met, he has distinguished first-hand experience of the expertise that the FSS brings to bear on criminal investigations. He referred to the conclusions of the Home Affairs Select Committee, to which we are now giving effect—and we are glad to do so. One of the concerns expressed by some of my hon. Friends on the Home Affairs Select Committee— although none of those present this morning—was that the FSS might be not so much set free as cast adrift on the choppy waters of privatisation. That was always a possibility under the previous Administration, as, in fairness, the hon. Gentleman will recognise. I am not saying that that was in his mind, but it was in the minds of some of his hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Greenway</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Had the previous Government gone so far as this Government are going in the order, that would have been described as privatisation by some of the Minister's hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boateng</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but my hon. Friends know that this measure is designed to free up the FSS to enable it to generate additional funds, which we know will be put to good use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy too give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks of continuing Home Office support for the vital role that the FSS research and development programme plays in policing. In the past, the Home Office has given direct support to that programme, and that form of support will of course cease once the FSS becomes a trading fund. However, in line with other research and development establishments, the FSS will be able to bid for moneys from the Home Office—specifically for police research and development purposes. The budget will of course vary from year to year, and for its bids to be successful, they will require the support of the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Home Office policy unit. However, given the track record of the FSS, I have no doubt that such appropriate bids as it makes will readily find such support. So the FSS will continue from strength to strength as a world-class leader in its field, and the order before the Committee will assist that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
