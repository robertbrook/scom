	<div class='legislation'>Draft Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (Specified Organisations) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (Specified Organisations) Order 1999.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 (Amendment) Order 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 525).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 (Specified Organisations) order was laid before the House in draft on 3 March 1999. The order has the effect of adding the Orange Volunteers and the Red Hand Defenders to the list of organisations that are ineligible for the benefit of the Northern Ireland Sentences Act 1998. That benefit is the early release of prisoners convicted of scheduled or terrorist-type offences. Those prisoners are, of course, released on licence. If an organisation is specified, supporters of that organisation do not qualify for early release. The order also removes the Irish National Liberation Army from the list and thus entitles its supporters to benefit from early release if eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 (Amendment) Order 1999 adds the Orange Volunteers and the Red Hand Defenders to the list of proscribed organisations in schedule 2 of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I go into more detail about the provisions of the orders and the need for them, I shall set them in context. As all Committee members will be aware, Northern Ireland has in recent weeks attracted much news coverage as the parties and Governments have urgently sought to secure the full implementation of the Belfast agreement. However, in the past 10 days we have, tragically, seen a return to the dark days of murder on the streets. Despite the positive efforts for a lasting peace, the tragic litany of murders and attempted murders continues. The most high profile of those, which attracted international attention and condemnation, was the murder of Rosemary Nelson, a much-loved wife and mother of three and, within her community and beyond, a highly respected solicitor. That murder was admitted to by the Red Hand Defenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The Government very much welcome the swift action that was taken by the Chief Constable in involving David Phillips, chief constable of Kent, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in investigating this horrendous murder. Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the Chief Constable, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"not only will this investigation be meticulous but it will be transparently obvious to"—</p></blockquote>
the family of Mrs Nelson—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and to the watching world. I am determined that those concerns will be addressed".</p></blockquote>
The Chief Constable has further emphasised that no constraint or limit whatsoever will be placed on Chief Constable Phillips and the FBI.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday in Castlewellan, County Down, the most recent of a number of vicious attacks took place, in which a man was injured by a grenade. That attack was admitted to by the Orange Volunteers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Set against those despicable acts, and with the memory of Omagh very much on our minds, is the fact that over the past year Northern Ireland has seen a transformation in its political climate. The Good Friday agreement has provided, for the first time in Northern Ireland's history, an opportunity to secure long-term peace and political stability based on an agreed accommodation between the two communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has already been a great deal of progress in implementing the agreement. The new Assembly has been set up, treaties have been signed to establish agreed cross-border bodies, the Human Rights Commission has been set up, reviews of policing and criminal justice are well underway and the Equality Commission will be established next month. Only a year ago, all that would have been unthinkable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still hard work to be done, but the prize is within our reach. That is what the organisations that are not on ceasefire want to destroy. They want to bring an end to the hard-won progress that has been made, and they must not be allowed to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now return to the orders. The specified organisations order specifies the Orange Volunteers and the Red Hand Defenders as organisations that are ineligible to benefit under the prisoner early release scheme. It also has the effect of de-specifying the Irish National Liberation Army and thus brings it within the early release scheme. That is in recognition of the fact that the Secretary of State now believes that INLA is observing a complete and unequivocal ceasefire. The same criterion was used for not specifying the PIRA, as well as the UDA, the UDF and other Loyalist organisations; in December last year, it was used for de-specifying the Loyalist Volunteer Force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Orange Volunteers are described in both orders as
	<br><blockquote><p>"The organisations using the name 'The Orange Volunteers' and being the organisation in whose name a statement described as a press release was published on 14th October 1998."</p></blockquote>
A copy of that press release has been deposited in the Library for the convenience of hon. Members. The rather precise wording was deemed necessary to differentiate between the present-day Orange
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0321">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Volunteers and an organisation of the same name, which is unrelated and which was formed in the 1970s. Although the 1970s organisation has been inactive for some years, it still exists. It is not, however, an organisation that should be proscribed, nor does it meet the criteria for specification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The emergency provisions amendment order proscribes the Orange Volunteers and the Red Hand Defenders. Because it was made under the urgency procedure for which sections 60(3) of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 provides, those organisations were proscribed with effect from 4 March 1999. We are seeking to have that proscription endorsed by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main effect of proscription is that membership of the named organisation in question becomes a criminal offence. In addition, proscription creates offences in relation to soliciting or inviting financial or other material support; helping to arrange, manage or address a meeting; and a person dressing or carrying articles in a way that is likely to arouse reasonable apprehension that he is a member or supporter of the relevant organisation. The orders should be seen as evidence of the proportionate response that the Government take to the extraordinarily complex situation in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there has been tremendous progress in Northern Ireland in a short period and, as I said, the Good Friday agreement is evidence of that. There is, however, still a small number of people on both sides of the community who want to halt that progress and destroy other people's hopes of a lasting peace. Recent events have shown all too tragically that those people are dangerous and pose a real threat to the community at large. The Government are resolute in their determination that those people will not succeed. That is why we have taken this action today. It is, however, not just up to the Government. It is the responsibility of the political parties, supported and encouraged by the Governments and by the people of Northern Ireland, to make political progress and to ensure that the agreement is implemented in full. I am sure that hon. Members agree that that represents the only way forward in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for explaining the two orders. Although they are extremely short, they are nevertheless important. We fully support the Government in laying them before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the orders have been formulated is interesting. We are grateful for the definition that the Minister gave of the Orange Volunteers. Some confusion has arisen about the name: it was previously used by another organisation, which, in the Government's eyes, is not one and the same as that in the order. We are grateful for the Minister's differentiation between the two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the heinous death of Mrs. Rosemary Nelson. This seems an appropriate time to add our comments on that event. Our sympathy goes to her family and friends, and we fully deprecate the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
actions of those in society who, as the Minister said, seem hellbent on destroying the agreement and the excellent work that has been done so far to progress it almost to its final stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government, as they said earlier today, and the parties to the agreement have more or less done everything that was required under the terms of the Belfast agreement. Everything was in place and the date of 10 March was chosen because by then the Government would have done everything that they said they would do. With the setting up of the Executive and the implementation under d'Hondt of the ministerial appointments, everything was ready to move forward. A new deadline has now been set and we offer the Government our hope that they are successful in those difficult and delicate negotiations— I know that the Secretary of State is involved in those discussions as we speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, however, sensible and right to point out that in our view the Unionists, particularly under the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), the First Minister, seem to have gone as far as they can go, yet no movement is forthcoming from Sinn Fein-IRA. There is no doubt in our minds that responsibility for the agreement not coming to fruition will lie with those on both sides of the paramilitary equation—both Sinn Fein-IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries—because they have not met the requirements of that section of the agreement dealing with decommissioning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the terrible death of Mrs. Rosemary Nelson, we welcome, and support the Minister's comments on, the speed with which the Chief Constable acted in bringing in outside bodies to help with the investigation—both the Kent constabulary and the FBI. We understand that the Royal Ulster Constabulary will nevertheless be heavily involved in the investigation, perhaps doing some groundwork under the aegis or guidance of the Kent constabulary. However, we now hear rumours of statements in parts of the nationalist community to the effect that the RUC should in no way be involved in investigating the death of Mrs. Nelson. That would be completely unacceptable to Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening extremely carefully to the hon. Gentleman. He is beginning to stray into the policy of the early release of prisoners, but that policy has already been passed by this Parliament. We are here to consider the narrow inclusion or exclusion of specific organisations on the list. I would ask the hon. Gentleman to be aware of the terms of this afternoon's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. O'Hara, for bringing me into line. I wanted to make the point that some of the organisations that are proscribed by these orders and specified in other legislation are the very organisations that are attempting to destabilise the situation in Northern Ireland and bring about a collapse of the agreement. Although I may have strayed a little, I wanted to relate the orders to the actions and motives of the organisations that they name. Indeed, Mrs. Rosemary Nelson was murdered by, and on the admission of, one of the organisations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
named in the order: the Red Hand Defenders. Therefore, I do not think that I was straying too far from the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that the RUC will indeed have a role to play in the investigation of Mrs. Nelson's murder, and that propaganda will not be allowed to cloud the issue or be used to undermine the role of the RUC and its standing in the community?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few months, there has been fragmentation among paramilitaries—perhaps it has been greater on the loyalist side than on the Sinn Fein-IRA side—but that problem may increase rather than decrease in future. It would be helpful if the Minister were to tell the Committee how he and the Government see that developing, and whether there is evidence of further fragmentation—perhaps on the nationalist and republican side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I opened my remarks by saying that we welcome the orders; we welcome the Minister's explanation, and we shall fully support them at the end of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Baker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly place on record the full support of the Liberal Democrats for the orders, which are proportionate, sensible and necessary? The Government have adopted a very sensible approach towards the difficult situation in Northern Ireland. I congratulate them on steering the ship so close to the harbour. This is not the time to rock the boat, and we want to support the Government in ensuring that the boat reaches the harbour and wish them every success during the next few days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Members for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) and for Lewes (Mr. Baker) for their general and specific welcomes for the way in which the Government have handled what have undoubtedly been very difficult negotiations and the complex situation in which those negotiations have been set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire asked two specific questions. The first concerned the role of the RUC in investigation. If he has read certain newspaper reports, he will know that there are more than rumours. It is clear that groups are campaigning specifically to broaden what has happened since the tragic murder of Rosemary Nelson to develop some form of inquiry. Clearly, what is involved is a murder investigation. Because of the international sensitivity of the issue, which the hon. Gentleman recognised, the Chief Constable acted promptly to put in place senior officers from another force to deal with it and called in the FBI to work alongside them. The hon. Gentleman welcomed the Chief Constable's initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am no expert on the detail, but I understand that about 40 to 60 police officers are involved in such a murder investigation. They are RUC officers. A murder investigation gets under way from the minute that someone loses their life, and it is right that officers
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
are immediatley engaged in trying to find those who have carried out those acts. That is in the interests of each and every one of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The RUC will conduct the investigation under the direction of the chief constable of Kent, Mr. Phillips. He will have control over the lines of inquiry— deciding which way to investigate the matter and pursue the prosecution of the case to find those who have carried out those acts. We all hope that they are swiftly brought to justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's question about fragmentation of other groups, we have witnessed fragmentation and dissident groups, as they are called, within the republican movement, and there are clearly other groups on the loyalist side of the equation. That is why we are proposing proscription of two of those loyalist groups. We hope that such fragmentation does not happen, but there can be no certainty in the dimensions that terrorism brings to the politics of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are today considering the narrow issue of those organisations that are listed, which are excluded from the benefit of the prisoner release scheme. The Minister will be aware that all the organisations that are enjoying the release of their prisoners have been engaged in various acts of violence. As well as addressing the issue of monitoring the possibility of splintering among those groups, will he assure us that he and the Secretary of State, under the terms of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998, will continue closely to monitor the activities of all organisations that are enjoying the release of their prisoners? If it is necessary to do so, will he return to the House to deal with organisations in blatant breach of their ceasefires or of the conditions laid down in the 1998 Act in respect of release of prisoners?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All prisoners will be released on licence, as they have been to date. Any breach of that licence, such as fundraising for an organisation that is not specified and which the Secretary of State has judged to be in breach of the ceasefire, will be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger of constantly asking about such matters is that people tend to look to the black side of the equation and to ignore all of the developments that have occurred—an issue that arose during question time in the House today. That is why I listed in my opening comments all of the developments that have occurred, and mentioned the fact that the incidence of murder, attempted murder and related violence that is usually associated with Northern Ireland is much less than ever before. Such crimes still occur too much, and some groups that are still active are still intent on carrying out more acts of violence against citizens elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is part of the reality, rather than the whole of it. A bigger part of the reality is the substantial change in the mindsets of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland who are signed up to the peace process, as they always were. More and more people want to share in it, and support comes even from people who would probably have supported the extremes in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

That is the benefit of the peace process. More can flow from it when parties currently engaged in the very difficult negotiations reach a conclusion and achieve the formation of the Executive and the decommissioning of illegally-held weapons, which is another important part of the Good Friday agreement. Once those two strands are settled, Northern Ireland will be put into a completely new environment, and into new political, social and economic circumstances. That is what its people genuinely want. The debate must therefore be balanced, and should not constantly focus on the difficult circumstances that we have to face.

The orders show us two parts of the debate. One is that a group that was involved in evil terrorist acts has been de-specified and is becoming part of the process of change. The other is that two break-away groups in the Loyalist community which are carrying out evil acts of murder and attempted murder have been proscribed and will be pursued with all the resources that we have to hand to bring them to justice and to achieve, I hope, a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
