	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The debate must proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I am glad to see that both Ministers are now present. As I was saying, when the Bill was introduced by the right hon Member for Western Isles on 13 February it is fair to say that the Committee would have benefited from the Minister's absence, because on that day he took about 55 minutes of filibustering in which to seek to frustrate its passage. It was because of the collapse of that legislation and the tremendous interest that was aroused in Scotland that we felt it necessary to take the opportunity of this Bill to bring before the Committee the fundamentals of the educational part of the right hon Member's Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 1 seeks to replicate the amendment to the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 which would have formed the educational part of the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. We recognise that in the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 there is reference to the Gaelic language. Section 1(5) (a)(iii) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this Act—
the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas",</p></blockquote>
that is, the provision of education by education authorities. Under "further education" there is provision for
	<br><blockquote><p>"the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas".</p></blockquote>
We know, therefore, that such references are enshrined in legislation. What concerns us is that the areas are not clearly defined so it is left to the discretion of individual local authorities to make provision for the teaching of the Gaelic language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed subsection (3A) in new clause 1 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of all education authorities in Gaelic-speaking areas to provide education in Gaelic."</p></blockquote>
Some hon Members raised doubts about that matter in the last debate because they felt that it could lead to the enforcement of education of children in Gaelic in the sense that Gaelic would be the medium of instruction. Our view was that it need not be the medium of instruction and that the preposition "in" could cover both the teaching of and the teaching in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can imagine that lawyers may wish to raise points about that and in some respects I have sought with the new clause to provide what could, in effect, be a Second Reading debate in the Committee. It will probably be our intention to seek to withdraw the new clause if there is a substantial feeling that it could be improved and we would seek to bring it back in a modified form on Report. We felt that on 13 February—unlucky Friday, certainly, for the Bill—other considerations were at work in the House. It is quite clear that if one wishes to frustrate one piece of legislation it is possible to do so on a Friday by filibustering on another. Unfortunately, the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was subjected to some filibustering, not least by the Government spokesman. The Labour and Nationalist Members who spoke were fairly brief and covered their points in a relatively short time. The Conservative Members spoke at considerable length and obviously what they said was relevant because Mr. Speaker did not object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>879</span>
Nevertheless, in many respects that detracted from the quality of what could have been a very helpful debate and proved a disappointment to many people in Scotland. We considered that in the rather calmer atmosphere of the Committee it would be helpful to reintroduce it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the new clause we say that it should be the duty of all education authorities in Gaelic-speaking areas to provide education in Gaelic, we go on to list the Gaelic-speaking areas as listed by the right hon Member for Western Isles and we specify the Highland region, the Western Isles island council, Argyllshire, the Inner Hebrides and Perthshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that doubts have been raised about the geographical, historical and linguistic accuracy of those areas. It has been said that some of them no longer exist, and that after the 1973 Act, which led to the reforming of local government, some of them do not exist in those forms. Nevertheless, they are areas which are clearly known to members of the Committee and, consequently, hon Members who have misgivings about the inclusion of some of the places can raise questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take note of them and if hon Members are genuine in their concern—I have no reason to believe that they are not—for the improvement and sponsorship of the language I hope that they would seek to draw attention to the areas which they regard as being most appropriate for that duty to be imposed on local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been informed—I suspect that it is nearer to the truth—that the bulk of the Gaelic-speaking people are in or around Glasgow at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In industrial concentrations with high populations there are obviously likely to be greater numbers of such people. That is a little like saying that there are more Jews in New York than in the State of Israel. That sort of statement can create problems. I believe that there are more Poles in Chicago than in Warsaw, and one can draw such parallels in terms of language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be up to Strathclyde region to make whatever provision it saw fit in the context of Glasgow and its Highland population. Where we have a natural indigenous community we hope that the local education authorities would meet their duties. We feel that at present they need more of a push in the direction of supporting the language than they have been able or willing to provide in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that the Western Isles have, partly because of the number of Gaelic speakers there, been blazing a trail in bilingual education. But I stress that they have not been guilty of what might be called the worst excesses of the Welsh experience, where there have been attempts in parts of that country virtually to force people to learn a language with which they are not well acquainted, or which is alien to them, or with which they do not wish to be associated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be a feature of the Western Isles that people there are more tolerant and easy-going, and can reach an understanding on the matter. Certainly, the Western Isles project which—as I said on Second Reading—has attracted a great deal of interest from educationists all
	<span class='label label-info column'>880</span>
over the world, has been regarded as a model of bilingual education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not suggesting that the local authorities should force education of or in Gaelic on Scottish people. But it is significant that some weeks after the parental charter we should seek to give local authorities a greater responsibility to provide an education in Gaelic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the point made by my hon Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton). It may well be that, if the sort of resources that many of us want were provided for Strathclyde region education service and the demand existed, it would be possible for there to be a school in Glasgow where the medium of instruction was Gaelic. It would be up to the local authority to make such a judgment; it is not for us to tell local authorities what to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr.Alexander Fletcher)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) aware that if Strathclyde region decided that it wanted to have a school that specialised in education in Gaelic—or of Gaelic—and felt that there was sufficient demand for that, no new powers would be necessary? The ability to do that already exists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the distinction which I had drawn between Glasgow and other areas that I called natural indigenous communities. But the matter depends on two factors: the first is whether Strathclyde region is able to pay for such a school; and the second is the amount of funding that it would receive from central Government to help carry out what, of necessity, would be an expensive experiment in bilingual education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe the use of the preposition "in"—that is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of all education authorities in Gaelic-speaking areas to provide education in Gaelic"</p></blockquote>
is essential. If a local authority feels that Gaelic should be the medium of instruction across the curriculum, the preposition must be included in the Bill. We believe that the proposal is desirable for the Gaelic-speaking areas and that those communities support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We realise that there are misgivings, which were hinted at on Second Reading. I should like those misgivings spelt out. For example, the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) told me privately that at one stage he believed that his area should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert McQuarrie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeenshire, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) is betraying a confidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I have been accused, albeit from a sedentary position, of betraying a confidence. But we know that the robust manner in which the hon Gentleman expresses himself makes confidences easy to betray. If I did betray a confidence, I am sorry. I realise that he has to creep and crawl back into respectability in the eyes of the pugilistic Whip because he has committed a heinous act beyond forgiveness or redemption in the eyes of the pugilistic Whip in voting courageously against the petrol increase. Having clearly said that he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0498">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>881</span>
would, he fulfilled his promise. I regret betraying a confidence but the hon Gentleman did say in his quiet soft-spoken way that he felt it would perhaps be preferable if his area were to be included. If he wants to make a contribution along those lines, I have no major objection to including such a reference on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that in respect of the Gaelic language the new clause makes only a small improvement, but there is a school of thought that believes that it is through the education system that a language can most easily be promoted. I do not wholly subscribe to that idea. I do not think that it is an exclusive responsibility of an education service to prop up a language, but it is significant that there has been a resurgence of Gaelic in recent years. Indeed, the successful television programme aroused a great deal of interest which led to local authorities starting evening classes on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to make clear, however, that while it is not difficult in urban areas to organise evening classes that are easily accessible to potential students and where transport is provided, the promotion and fostering of the language has, to a large extent, to be done in the schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question not of exporting Gaelic to the Lowlands, but of fostering and helping it in those areas where it has traditional roots and where there are signs of an arousal of interest. Experience of what has taken place in the Western Isles shows the tolerant and sensitive way in which it has been presented to young people and to parents. There is a great deal of confidence in the scheme and, as a parent and teacher I would not put the idea forward if I thought it would be used as a means to force a language on an unwilling population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities should not have merely the power, they should have the duty and responsibility to support the Gaelic language. They should help it especially in those areas where there has traditionally been interest in the Gaelic language and a fair amount of it spoken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that hon Members will have gone to the census and be regretting that it is only two weeks since the last census, that they will tell us about the penetration of the language in different areas and that it is spoken more widely in graveyards than anywhere else. I am not prepared to go into a numbers game at this stage and I do not think that the legislation requires us to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation that we envisage would be applied by local authorities in a straightforward way, with consultations beforehand, with opt-out facilities for parents, and where the duty to have a Gaelic medium for instruction would apply only in areas with an overwhelming support for the scheme. Secondly, in that sense, there would have to be alternative facilities for parents who did not want their children to be taught in Gaelic. I imagine that that would mean alternative schools being near to hand, which I do not think is unlikely or unreasonable to expect of the local authorities mentioned on this list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We put the clause forward in the spirit of a Second Reading debate. We would seek to withdraw the new clause at the end of our discussion. We hope to amend the clause and reintroduce it on Report and, having amended it along the lines that hon Members might wish to suggest, hope that we could build on the foundation of the 1980 Act and work towards a situation where the language which in Scotland has always been a
	<span class='label label-info column'>882</span>
poor relation would be given more assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard from the Minister on previous occasions that he is not antipathetic to our objectives, but he is, perhaps, just dubious about the means by which we seek to achieve our aims. We are not being hard and fast here, but a greater emphasis should be given by our education service to the Gaelic language, and we feel that this emphasis and the support for it ought to start in the areas we have outlined here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We once again point out that if hon Members want areas deleted, or included, or if they wish to have amendments made in regard to particular parishes, we would be more than happy to look at that. I have had discussions with An Comunn Gaidhealach, who said that they are prepared to provide us with information as regards the parishes—one might say that that is the smallest unit one could have as regards the language— and we would be willing to look at these areas to see whether anything could be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, I will be happy to take on board any suggestions that Conservative Members choose to make, provided that the suggestions would not, at the end of the day, wreck the intention of the clause. However, at this stage we would be willing to listen and to withdraw the amendment in order to come back to the Floor of the House and perhaps have an amendment in the form of a new clause which would reinforce the intentions of clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that it will be helpful to the Committee if I intervene now, as this is being taken as a Second Reading debate on the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to understand what the hon Gentleman is driving at in tabling the new clause and in talking of new powers and the advancement of the Gaelic language in education in Scotland. Section 1 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, which is aimed at explaining the provision of educational authorities, and lays down the duty of education authorities to secure provision of education, defines school education, further education and other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection 5(a)(iii) states that school education means, among other things,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas"</p></blockquote>
That is a duty of an education authority. Under further education, again as a duty, subsection 5(b)(iv) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas"</p></blockquote>
We have been through this before in the Bill presented to the House by the right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart), and I would have thought that it was a most satisfactory arrangement, as regards the powers Parliament is giving to education authorities, in laying upon them a duty to provide the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears from the 1980 Act that the definition of Gaelic-speaking areas depends on the interpretation of the courts. Would the Minister like to give us his definition of Gaelic-speaking areas in Scotland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that with this duty laid upon all Scottish education authorities, where there is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0499">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>883</span>
demand for the Gaelic language to be taught, the education authorities have to supply, wherever it is in Argyllshire, Perthshire, or even in Glasgow, where I understand that the 1979 school census revealed that 137 children were learning Gaelic in schools. We believe that the powers in the Bill are adequate to allow education authorities to have Gaelic taught in our schools wherever the demand happens to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a straightforward and legitimate function of an education Act to provide a duty for education authorities to operate in that way. When one tries to define those areas in legislation, as we discussed in the main debate on the Floor of the House a few weeks ago, one immediately runs into difficulties—not least, the difficulty of compulsion. If we want to destroy the growing— not declining—interest in the Gaelic language, or in anything else, make it compulsory. The Gaelic language is no exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause surprises me because a large part of the debate on the Floor of the House was spent in discussing the deficiencies of the Bill presented to the House by the right hon Member for Western Isles, particularly the provision of education "in Gaelic" which could have meant any one of a number of things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to stick to the new clause as drafted. It is all very well for the hon Gentleman to say that we should have yet another debate on the principle of Gaelic education, look at the details of the amendment and come back to the subject on Report. The effect of the first part of the amendment is uncertain since it is by no means clear what is intended—whether the proposal goes further than the existing duty to provide adequate and efficient school and further education which includes, as I have quoted from the 1980 Act, the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Act stated that Gaelic may in addition be used as a medium of instruction in other subjects if that were the wish of the head teacher and of the education authorities. Therefore, no extra power is needed there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister now saying that the matter should simply be left to the discretion of the head teacher?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that that matter can be left to anyone other than the head teacher and the education authorities—I mentioned both—to decide whether in their area education should be "in Gaelic" as distinct from the teaching of Gaelic. Those were the two propositions discussed by the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire. The clause uses the phrase "education in Gaelic" which is neither specific nor clear, as I have already said, nor is the duty further defined either in the clause or in the hon Gentleman's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the hon Gentleman, he referred essentially to the need to give more encouragement to the use of the Gaelic language. There is no disagreement across the Committee on that point. The hon Gentleman referred to the need to make sure that Gaelic is available on demand. That would be difficult if the demand in a particular part of Scotland were from only one or two children. It would require special consideration, whether in a Highland or in a Lowland area. I do not believe that any subject, no matter how attached to
	<span class='label label-info column'>884</span>
the subject we may be, can be provided on demand simply because one or two people may be interested in it. Although today in Scotland, in or outside school, there is a growing interest in the language, opportunities exist for people to learn it, not least from the television programmes to which the hon Gentleman referred. But here we are referring specifically to the duty imposed on education authorities. For the Committee or, indeed, the House, to take the matter further by defining Gaelic-speaking areas in the way that the clause suggests, which frankly, is too wide and much too loose, would not, in my view advance the Opposition's objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present education authorities decide whether their areas, or parts of them, should be regarded as Gaelic-speaking for the purposes of existing education legislation. The Government maintain that education authorities are in the best position to take that decision bearing in mind local conditions and locally expressed views. It would be entirely beyond the ability of the House to provide a more flexible, pertinent or helpful definition. We leave it to local opinion. The local education authority decides the extent to which local opinion demands that Gaelic should be taught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to what has been said, and I still have fresh in my mind the debate that we had on the Floor of the House. The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire complained that my Front Bench speech was rather lengthy. However, that was simply a measure of the thoroughness with which the Government considered the matter. We did not wish to reach a hasty decision when the right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) produced his Bill. In the end we took the view that that Bill would not help the language, and the least that we could do was spend time on the Floor of the House explaining that decision. Nothing that the hon Gentleman has said so far in this short debate has changed my view of the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must welcome the opportunity provided by the new clause to discuss the question of the Gaelic language in the education system. The failure, or difficulty, encountered by my right hon Friend the Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) over his Bill on Gaelic several weeks ago has caused tremendous annoyance in Gaelic-speaking areas, however difficult it may be to designate and define such areas. Gaelic speakers are outraged that my right hon Friend's Bill was killed off in such a manner. The Committee must concede that there was much time-wasting in the course of that debate, and that it was intended that the Bill should founder as it did. The enemies of the Bill refused to attack it cleanly, but chose to do so through the closure motion. The behaviour of the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) in acting as a Teller on that occasion puts into perspective the subsequent sickening hypocrisy of his own independent measure relating to the Gaelic language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seeks to provide for education in Gaelic in certain designated areas. I thank the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) and his hon Friends for presenting the new clause and giving us the opportunity to discuss the matter—especially in the light of the outrage felt in many parts of Scotland after the failure of the original Bill, in which there were education provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who are interested in and have a responsibility for the Gaelic language are dissatisfied with the existing statutory provision. They feel strongly that the language should be taught in traditionally Gaelic-speaking areas. That is because, although many areas may have been Gaelic-speaking at one time, through force of circumstances, both of apathy and hostility—including hostility from the education system at certain times—the language has receded. They would like the language to be given a better opportunity in areas where, they say, the Gaelic tradition is still strong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have not always been helped by the local authorities in certain areas which have had a hostile, antipathetic attitude to the language. It would, in the view of those who are responsible for the language such as An Comunn, be a great step forward if areas that were traditionally Gaelic-speaking were defined and if an obligation were placed on local authorities to provide tuition in the language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to have vanished again, but when he talked about the dangers of imposing an obligation on the local authorities, it seemed to me that he did not take cognisance of the whole point of the Bill, which is that it imposed obligations on the education system. Local authorities, whether they like it or not, will have to go along with some of the changes which the Government are implementing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that a Conservative Government would have responded more sympathetically to the amendment and to the proposition that Gaelic should be given a better deal in educational terms, for two reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Conservative Party has particularly to play down the anti-Scottish element that it has displayed over the decades. This would be a useful opportunity to take a pro-Scottish stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, at the time of the last election, the Conservative Party came out with specific proposals regarding Gaelic and education in Gaelic. I shall quote from a speech by the Gentleman who is now the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) but who was then
	<span class='label label-info column'>886</span>
prospective Conservative candidate, which he made as chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party education policy committee. He made the speech in Inveraray, Argyll on Monday, 26 March at the interesting hour of 8 pm. Having first indicated that An Comunn would be given an increase in its budget of £39,000 a year—it will be interesting to hear just how much An Comunn got— he dealt with broadcasting, which was covered by my hon Friend's Bill, and then came to education. I should like to spend some time on the first two parts of that speech in which he committed the incoming Conservative Government to action, but on educational provision, the hon Gentleman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Third, education policy must allow those children whose parents wish them to learn Gaelic to be able to do so. Choice in education is central to Conservative philosophy and there is a place in our education system for schools offering Gaelic. In areas like the Western Isles it is possible in the primary school to have a bi-lingual policy where subjects are taught in both Gaelic and English. Of course, there would need to be schools offering an 'English only' education so that parents would have the choice of the kind of education they wished"—</p></blockquote>
though, apparently, according to what the Minister has said, parents who might want Gaelic may not have that choice offered to them. If one is an English speaker, one has the choice; if one is a Gaelic speaker, one does not necessarily have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman went on to say—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I can understand how uncomfortable hon Gentlemen opposite are about this—
	<br><blockquote><p>"I recognise that such a policy would cost more money"—</p></blockquote>
that is an interesting policy statement—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and I would hope that extra expenditure would qualify for a 100% Rates Support Grant."</p></blockquote>
That is very interesting indeed. It is not just the 100 per cent, but the extra expenditure that will qualify. I know that the Minister does not like hearing about extra expenditure and election promises.
	<br><blockquote><p>"In areas outside the Gaelic 'heartland' Gaelic is already offered in some schools as an alternative to a foreign language."</p></blockquote>
I do not quibble about that; there is enough to quibble about in this statement. It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Qualified teachers are in short supply and thus only a limited number of schools can offer Gaelic. Again, with parents being given the freedom to choose the school they wish for their children those who want Gaelic will be able to have it."</p></blockquote>
As the hon Gentleman will accept, that does not necessarily apply in some rural areas where considerable distances must be travelled to find a school offering Gaelic. The statement continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We must encourage the colleges of education and specifically Aberdeen and Jordanhill to undertake the training of teachers prepared to teach Gaelic and to teach in Gaelic."</p></blockquote>
If it is correct that certain teacher training colleges are to be given one year's additional survival, perhaps they, too, could be allowed to participate in the scheme. The speech continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Last year Teddy Taylor, Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, announced that the Conservative Government would appoint a Minister responsible for the Highlands. This Minister would be responsible for helping An Comunn, the B.B.C. and Education Authorities to pursue policies helpful to Gaelic. I am sure that those suggestions which my Committee will put to an incoming Conservative Government will meet with the support both of Gaelic speakers and also of non-Gaelic speakers."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, the last sentence of the important speech made by the hon Member for Argyll prior to the election says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is of vital importance that help for Gaelic does not alienate the English-speaking people in the Highlands and lose their sympathy for plans to encourage the Gaelic language."</p></blockquote>

But, he knows—based on what he said at the time—the realities of the matter, how his incoming Conservative Government have betrayed the language and have refused to give it the rights long wished for by Gaelic speakers, as represented by An Comuun—that he has let down the whole of Scotland. The new clause gives the Minister the opportunity for reconsideration and I hope that he takes it. If he does not, I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column'>888</span>
we can return to the matter on Report, because probably the whole question of the lack of further provision for education in Gaelic in Scotland—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister shakes his head, but he should know that if this Bill, which is supposed to give a right of parental choice, refuses to give the same rights to parents who wish their children to speak Gaelic as to English-speaking children, its title is a misnomer. I therefore ask him to reconsider completely the Government's position, otherwise he will be stoking up even more outrage in the Highlands and other Gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and East Perthshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new clause is identical to clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill that had its Second Reading on 13 February. I honestly wonder whether hon Members who have spoken today listened to that debate. Have they read the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of the debate. If not, what are they doing tabling this new clause unamended?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was simply because we did not believe the rubbish that the hon Gentleman spoke that day in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Anyone who cares to read the report of that debate will realise that I, at least, have been consistent in my approach to the Gaelic problem. I have not been diverted by political opportunities, as have some hon Members. May I draw the attention of the hon Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Wilson) to this fact? My duty is to all my electorate, the bulk of whom do not speak Gaelic, although a few—about 1.6 per cent.—do. Furthermore, the bulk have no interest in Gaelic and have no wish to have their children educated in it, but they most certainly do wish to have their children educated in English because they want them to have a full and proper life in the world as it really exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also remind the hon Gentleman that Inver-gowrie, in my constituency, is part of old Perthshire and there is no demand in Invergowrie for children to be taught in Gaelic. Indeed, as the hon Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) would no doubt agree, there is very little demand in that part where our constituencies abut for children to be taught Gaelic. That does not mean that the hon Gentleman and I are opposed to children whose parents wish them to be taught Gaelic having the facilities available to them. Let me again make that clear as I did on Second Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a reply to an intervention during the Second Reading debate, the right hon Member for Western Isles made what is happening today nonsense and a farce. My hon Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) in his intervention in c. 1090 said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The words used by the right hon Gentleman were 'education in Gaelic'. Is he talking about the teaching of the Gaelic language, or is he suggesting that it shall be the duty of all education authorities in those areas to provide Gaelic as the medium of instruction for all subjects, including the scientific subjects, that schoolchildren learn? I do not think that what the right hon Gentleman is after comes out clearly from the working of the clause."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>889</span>
The right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is a fair point. I am aiming at the teaching of the language in schools where it is required. To go beyond that would be dear to the people who have the interests of Gaelic at heart but that is for a more distant time."</p></blockquote>
I hardly think that the few weeks that have elapsed can be called a distant time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon Gentleman continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill seeks to provide the opportunity to teach the language to children in areas where it is required."</p></blockquote>
I must make the following point because it reflects on Perthshire, which is covered by the new clause as it is a designated area. I said in the Second Reading debate
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are no schools in Perth and East Perthshire where the Gaelic is not taught. That does not mean that at no time in the future will it be taught. I believe that the voluntary approach is best, and that where schools can get something going and there is enough demand the teaching of Gaelic will happen."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 February 1981; Vol. 998, cc. 1090-7.]</p></blockquote>
That is the difference between the pragmatic honest approach—I make no apology for saying that—of the Government and that of those who supported that Bill. Incidentally, I noted that on Second Reading exactly half of them were absent—namely, the hon Members for Inverness (Mr. Johnston), West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), Dunbartonshire, West (Mr. Campbell) and Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. White). It is interesting to see that exactly half of those who tabled the new clause are also absent—one because he has been replaced, and the other because he is not a member of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. The reason for the replacement of my hon Friend the Member for Stirling, Falkirk and Grangemouth (Mr. Ewing) is that he is ill.

The hon Gentleman who introduced the new clause suggested that if any member of the Committee had reservations about the areas so designated that would be taken into consideration. During Second Reading
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>891</span>
on 13 February I made my reservations quite clear. I should add that since then and as a direct result of a follow up with An Comunn Gaidhealach—I have been in constant communication and negotiation with that body on various matters—I said to that organisation, as I said at the Mod over a year ago, that as far as Blairgowrie high school was concerned, which caters for the areas of Strathardle and Glenshee, I would conduct an in-depth investigation to find out whether there was any demand for Gaelic to be taught at that school. Thus far, I have found only one individual who is interested in both those glens, so that is the situation which exists there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also said that I would conduct investigations on behalf of the catchment area of the Alyth school. Thus far I have discovered no one who is interested. I add that the headmaster of that school is not at all happy because he thinks that it is a political gimmick and he objects to his school being treated in that way—not by me but by those who tried to make a political football of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conjunction with An Commun Gaidhealach I have also agreed to examine the matter of Perth grammar school and the catchment area it serves—the country area. I cannot report on that matter at present because my investigations are nowhere near to being complete, other than to say that I have yet to uncover anyone who wants to take part in it. That does not mean that there is no one in that area who is interested. My investigations to date have not yet uncovered anyone, but someone may well be discovered in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Opposition Members genuinely felt that there was a need for something along those lines they should have examined their proposals carefully. They would have realised that by taking the exact parts of the previous Bill they would make it extremely difficult to have a sensible discussion because we were bound to concentrate, as we did in the past, on the matters which arose from that Bill. I believe that in one or two of the old traditional Gaelic areas one or two activists are now stirring. I have received two letters from people in the constituency so it is possible to get the matter right since the whole business of the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was debated on the Floor of the House. That shows the depth of great feeling which exists— two letters. I do not doubt that there may be others and I should add that I have received dozens of letters to tell me that the writers wanted Gaelic to be treated properly, but not to become a priority because they objected to its being treated as an equal to English. Parents in Perthshire are concerned because it was a designated area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the new clause is mischievous and an abuse of the Committee. It is an abuse to introduce it unamended especially after the lengthy debate which we had on 13 February when the sponsor of that Bill was forced to admit that in Committee it would have had to be substantially amended. I repeat that to introduce that, unamended, is an abuse of the Committee and of our time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not speak Gaelic but I envy those who do because it is part of our Scottish culture and heritage and as such it ought to have far higher priority within our educational system. Conservative Members
	<span class='label label-info column'>892</span>
may point out that only a small minority of people in Scotland speak Gaelic, and that may well be true. Nevertheless, it is important that our educational system should cater for minorities. That minority is fairly sizeable. Over 88,000 people in Scotland speak Gaelic, which is about 1.8 per cent, of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading of the Bill introduced by the right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) the Minister with responsibility for education, the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"both in numbers and as a proportion of the population, 10 times as many people speak the Welsh language in Wales as speak Gaelic in Scotland."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 February 1981; Vol. 998, c. 1117.]</p></blockquote>
That is false. The proportion of Welsh speakers may be about 10 times the proportion that it is in Scotland, but the numbers are not. If 88,000 is multiplied by 10 the result is 880,000, and there are not that many Welsh speakers in Wales. The number is about 524,000—just under 20 per cent, of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Minister will at least have the decency to withdraw and apologise for that remark which he made on the Second Reading of the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. He has shown during this debate that he is not only illiterate but also in-numerate. An apology from him to the sizeable minority of Gaelic speakers in Scotland would be appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some areas it is not a minority but a significant majority of the population who speak Gaelic. In the Western Isles, for example, I understand that 82 per cent, of the population over the age of three speak both Gaelic and English and that, in Skye and Lochalsh, the percentage is 59.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also bear in mind that part of the reason why only a minority of people speak Gaelic in Scotland is Government policy past and present. Probably the biggest single historical factor is the depopulation that came as a result of the Highland clearances. By the end of the nineteenth century, Gaelic became the language of resistance and the expression of the hopes and aspirations for the transformation of society in the Highlands and elsewhere in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like briefly to refer to some of the past attempts to suppress Gaelic, because it is important to place them on record in this debate. The suppression of Gaelic goes back a long way—to the Middle Ages. It was the invasion of Scotland by William the Conqueror that helped to bring it about. The hon Member for Galloway (Mr. Lang) may be interested to hear that my illustrious predecessor, Tom Johnston, the first Labour Member of Parliament for West Stirlingshire and afterwards Secretary of State for Scotland, said in his book, "The History of the Working Classes in Scotland", in Galloway:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the tongues of the children"—</p></blockquote>
this was in the twelfth century—
	<br><blockquote><p>"were torn out"—</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not think we may have these historical lectures at this point of the debate. I hope that the hon Gentleman will relate what he is saying precisely to the amendment before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0504">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>893</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr.Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I briefly finish my reference to the fact that that happened in the past? Unfortunately, some of these attitudes still prevail today. They may not be tearing out children's tongues, but there certainly seems to be an attitude of complacency or, indeed, antipathy on the part of some hon Members on the Government Benches in their discouragement of Gaelic expression. That may have much to do with the anglicised education which many of them have had. The Minister of State, who is supposed to be in charge of the Highlands, was educated, by and large, south of the border. The Minister here, the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Fairgrieve) was educated south of the border. That seems to have had an effect on their attitudes in terms of their lack of encouragement of Gaelic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not until the Education (Scotland) Act 1918 that we had the beginnings of the legislation to which the Minister referred in his speech. When the 1918 Act was originally drafted it did not include specific reference to the teaching of Gaelic. That came almost as an afterthought on the then Government's part. Because of some hard lobbying by An Comunn Gaidhealach at that time, it was eventually included in the 1918 Act, and it has been included and consolidated in later Acts, which is why the Minister was able to refer to the 1980 Act referring to the teaching of Gaelic in "Gaelic-speaking areas". So the term "Gaelic-speaking areas" is already included in legislation. The amendment attempts to get a clearer definition for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may argue that the terminology or the definition in the amendment is imperfect. It is a mixture of the existing and the old local government boundary terminology. For example, it refers to the "Highland Region" and the "Western Isles". On the other hand, it refers to "Argyllshire" and "Perthshire". Although Perthshire ceased to exist as a local government unit in 1975, it is still clearly defined geographically, and part of Perthshire comes into the Central region, which also covers part of my constituency, so one of the local education authorities which concerns my constituents would be involved if the amendment were accepted. Similarly, part of the old Argyll county comes into Strathclyde, so there would be an onus on Strathclyde in that part of Argyll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would strengthen the existing legislation. It would place an increased statutory responsibility on the local education authorities in respect of these stipulated areas. I think that that would be a good thing as regards the encouragement of Gaelic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also referred to the terminology in our amendment, which says
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"to provide education in Gaelic,"</p></blockquote>
whereas in the 1980 Act, which I think copies the terminology of the original insertion in the 1918 Act, it refers simply to the teaching of Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas. I do not think that the Minister appreciated the distinction. There is a difference between teaching Gaelic and education in Gaelic. Where the demand exists, there should be an opportunity to use Gaelic as the medium of expression in teaching and learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was shocked during my recent much-publicised visit to Hong Kong to discover that the British imperial-
	<span class='label label-info column'>894</span>
ist system of education is such that one can see a Chinese teacher teaching a class of 40 Chinese children Chinese history and, by statute, by the educational policy in Hong Kong, having to teach them in English. That is an absolute tragedy. I hope that where the mother tongue of all the children in a class is Gaelic, and the teacher is proficient in Gaelic, that language can be used as the medium for expression and for teaching and learning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also to think in terms of encouraging the promotion of Gaelic in the curriculum. There is already provision for—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the sitting was suspended, I was referring to the importance of encouraging Gaelic in the curriculum in schools. I have never believed that the curriculum should simply be geared to those students who want to sit examinations. There is already provision, of course, for the Scottish certificate of education O-grade and H-grade in Gaelic, but can the Minister say what is being done in the schools to cater for Gaelic-speaking pupils who may not be able to sit either O-grade or H-grade in Gaelic but who, come from a Gaelic-speaking home in a Gaelic-speaking area? Are they being encouraged to develop their language?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister could also tell us whether there are any Gaelic speakers on SCE examination boards—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon Gentleman doing the Minister's job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John MacKay</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon Gentleman the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would rather hear the answer from the Minister than from his protege. The Minister has the statutory responsibility. The hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay) is not yet Minister, although he crawls enough on his knees during Prime Minister's Question Time, as though he expects to be a Minister next week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are Her Majesty's inspectors saying about the teaching of Gaelic, and of the broader aspect of Gaelic education in Scottish schools? I have heard reports that the amount of resources going into the teaching of Gaelic leaves a lot to be desired, compared with the distribution of resources in the teaching of language in general. I have heard complaints that there is a lack of audio-visual aids—very important in language teaching —and that in the teaching of Gaelic there is still far too much emphasis on book work rather than on oral expression. I am not against book work. Obviously, Gaelic literature, whether prose or poetry, is very important, but the oral approach is just as important, and sometimes even more so. What observations, if any, has the inspectorate made about these aspects of teaching Gaelic?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>895</span>
The Minister seems to be unduly complacent with the present statutory provision which has been in force since 1918. He may like to give us the figures of failure of the existing statutory provision, because we have seen a decline in the number of Gaelic speakers since the 1918 Act. So, the insertion in that Act, although maybe an improvement on the Bill originally drafted, seems to have failed to achieve its objective, and that is why my hon Friends and I have tabled this new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that we should leave it to demand, that there already is a statutory responsibility if there is a demand. The Minister cannot have his cake and eat it. He is saying that it is best left to local education authorities, yet when we were discussing the assisted places scheme he was not in favour of leaving that to the local education authorities to decide what was best for their areas. He wanted centralised responsibility laid down in the statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has nothing to do with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has everything to do with it. A local education authority has statutory responsibility for education within its area. In one sphere the Government are imposing centralised control and direction, but in the other they are to leave matters to the discretion of local education authorities. That is a little two-faced, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1980 Act, from which the Minister quoted, specifically refers to Gaelic-speaking areas. It does not say that the decision should be left to the local education authorities. If there is any doubt, as there appears to be in the Committee, about what is a Gaelic-speaking area, it is up to the Minister to give us his definition. Failing that, if there were a challenge in the courts it would be up to a sheriff to decide whether an area was Gaelic-speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon Gentleman. The new clause falls down, as does the Bill of the right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart), when it tries to define Gaelic-speaking areas. In 1979 the education authorities themselves defined Gaelic-speaking areas as some parts of the Highland region, the Argyll and Bute division of Strathclyde in part, and the Western Isles. Other areas where Gaelic was taught but which were not so defined were Tayside and Glasgow. A very few pupils were learning the language in Central region and in the Ayr division of Strathclyde.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that to illustrate the impossibility of defining Gaelic-speaking areas in legislation. Pockets of interest can arise in various parts of Scotland. Where the interest is there—I agree entirely that such interest should be encouraged—the education authority has a duty to provide either education in Gaelic, if that is required, or the teaching of Gaelic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman asked earlier whether any other member of the Scottish certificate of education examination board was a Gaelic speaker. In fact the chairman, Farquhar Mcintosh, is a Gaelic speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>896</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon Friend develop a certain point, and will the Minister reply to it? I am interested not so much in the determination of what is a Gaelic-speaking area, although we are grateful for that information, but in what duty, if any, a local authority has to respond to a request from parents for an area to be considered a Gaelic-speaking area for the purposes of the duty imposed in the 1980 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:This is slightly unusual—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not believe that it is in order for the Minister to reply to an intervention at this stage. The hon Gentleman will wind up the debate in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:Before my hon Friend's intervention the Minister seemed to be saying that there was general agreement among education authorities about what was a Gaelic-speaking area. If that is so, why not enshrine that view in legislation? Why is the Minister so reluctant to define the areas in legislation? I believe that our definition of Gaelic-speaking areas, was received from An Comunn Gaidhealach, which is more expert in identifying such areas than is the Minister. If that definition is imperfect, if the Minister disagrees with the geography of our list, why does he not put a list of what the local education authorities consider to be Gaelic-speaking areas into the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I refer to what the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) said about the Bill introduced by the right hon Member for Western Isles. I was pleased and proud to be asked by the right hon Member to be a sponsor of his Bill. Regrettably, I was unable to be present on Second Reading, for a reason that I explained to the right hon Member. As chairman of the Scottish Parliamentary Labour group I was chairing an important meeting in Glasgow that day on employment in the construction industry. The right hon Member said that he did not think that my presence would make much difference to the passage of his Bill. As things worked out, that was the case. The Bill was not voted upon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) asked why we had tabled the amendment, which was basically taken from clauses 1 and 2 of the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The reason is simple. The House was denied the opportunity to vote on this important matter on 13 February, and therefore hon Members should be given the opportunity to vote on it either today or on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3 of the Gaelic Language (No. 2) Bill states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be a duty of local authorities in Gaelic-speaking areas to promote through voluntary bodies the use of Gaelic in drama, music, prose and poetry groups."</p></blockquote>
Fair enough, but why just voluntary bodies? Why not statutory bodies as well, such as the local education authority schools?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman had been present for the Second Reading of that Bill he would have known why I specified voluntary bodies. If he cares to read the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of that debate he will see why. That is why I said that I had been consistent throughout, and I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>897</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have read the 
	<i>Hansard</i> reports of both Bills and, frankly, I am not impressed by the hon Member's explanation. Nor am I impressed by his ambivalent stance on this whole matter. I suspect that the Gaelic Language (No. 2) Bill was just thought up as a way out because he felt so ashamed of himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing other Bills. We are discussing the new clause. I hope that the hon Member will remember that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government are supposed to believe in freedom of choice, and they claim that that is the basic philosophy of the Bill. If they believe in that —and cultural diversity should be an important part of that freedom—they should encourage freedom of expression, whether in English or Gaelic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I quote from a Dr. Mackintosh Mackay, who was a member of a commission set up to investigate the state of Scottish education some time ago—in 1860.1 do not know whether he was an ancestor of the hon Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay). He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I consider it an advantage decidedly, that Gaelic should cease. Gaelic schools the people won't have."</p></blockquote>
I am afraid that the attitude of Dr. Mackintosh Mackay still exists today. Unfortunately, we hear it expressed from the Government Benches. That is why I think that my hon Friends are right to raise this important matter. If an amendment along the lines that we propose were accepted, at least it would go some way to encourage education in Gaelic and the teaching of Gaelic in our schools, and indeed in further education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just heard a hypocritical speech from the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now for another one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least I am consistent. I observe on the new clause the name of the hon Member for West Stirlingshire. He said that when the Gaelic Language (No. 2) Bill was going through the House the right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) suggested to him that his presence that day would not make much difference to the debate. Having listened to his hypocritical speech this evening, I must say that what he has said will make little difference to the effect that the new clause will have on our lives. It shows his ignorance of what is wanted in Scotland in the context of Gaelic education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is a ploy on the part of the Opposition, and I am sad that the right hon Member for Western Isles has put his name to it. The right hon Member represents the area that contains much of the Gaelic-speaking population of Scotland. They want to see Gaelic used to the fullest extent possible, not the rubbish in the two subsections of the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) suggested that the Opposition were prepared to seek to withdraw the clause and bring forward an alternative proposal on Report. My answer to that is that if they thought that it was so important to bring forward a new clause why did they not bring forward a clause that would have included the provisions of all the clauses in the Bill introduced by
	<span class='label label-info column'>898</span>
the right hon Member for Western Isles? If ever there was a disgrace on the question of Gaelic speaking, it was on the day that right hon Member's Bill did not obtain Second Reading. Forty Opposition Members were not present on that day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Bill has gone through the House, and it contains the name of the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). He, too, was not present on that day, yet he put his name to another Gaelic Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to refer again to the previous Bill, but the hon Member must appreciate that that was the only part of the Bill that it would have been in order for us to discuss under a Scottish Education Bill. The other parts did not relate to education. Had they done so we should have sought to resurrect them by that means. It was not open to us to do that, and that was why we did not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McQuarrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon Gentleman for that statement. If that is so, why does the hon Member propose in subsection (2):
	<br><blockquote><p>"At the end of subsection (5) of the said section (1) there shall be inserted:—

	<div class='ul'>

	<li>"(d) Gaelic-speaking areas" means—</li>

	<ol>

	<li>the Highland Region;</li>

	<li>The Western Isles Island Council;</li>

	<li>Argyllshire and the Inner Hebrides; and</li>

	<li>Perthshire.'."?</li></ol></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
Those are the same words as in the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill brought forward by the right hon Member for Western Isles. Why, therefore, was cognisance not taken of other hon Members' speeches in the House on the previous day to bring in wider areas? That would have been within the concept of this Bill. The sphere could have been widened if it had been thought necessary. That is what the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire said he was prepared to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire and the hon Member for West Stirlingshire are inconsistent in what they say. On 13 February the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our commitment to the language was quite clear in that election manifesto."</p></blockquote>
—he had been questioned by another hon Member on the matter—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Obviously we felt that legislation of this nature was better promoted on a Private Member's basis."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 13 February 1981; Vol. 998, cc. 1114-15.]</p></blockquote>
On that day he thought that it was right to bring in a Private Member's Bill, but now because he has the opportunity to get political publicity on behalf of the Opposition for the Gaelic-speaking people he tries to include it in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is pure hypocrisy. It is dishonest and distasteful rubbish for those who genuinely wish to see the Gaelic language promoted in Scotland to suggest that this will be the answer to An Comunn Gaidhealach or to any Gaelic-speaking person. Labour Members should not suggest that if they want the support of Government Members, who are tremendously interested in the language in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) said this afternoon that in the Glasgow area there are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>899</span>
almost as many Gaelic-speaking people as there are in all the other areas. If those who tabled amendment considered it worth while, that area should have been included. It is dishonest not to have done so. It is unfair to the Committee that they have had the temerity to table the amendment and suggest that it is the answer to the desires of the Gaelic-speaking people. The amendment is rubbish, and should not be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. The hon Gentleman has repeated these remarks two or three times. Is that not tedious repetition, and should it not be ruled out of order? He would not get by with it on "Just a Minute".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are right, Mr. Hunt. There is so little that I can say about the new clause that will be in its favour.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In deference to you, Mr. Hunt, I shall draw my remarks to a close. If the new clause had been worded so as to be acceptable to someone such as myself, I should have had great pleasure in supporting it. If the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire brings back a clause that is radically different from this and is worded so as to be acceptable to people who are interested in the Gaelic it might have some merit, but in its present state it is dishonest of the Opposition to have brought it forward. It is a discredit to them and should be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I first saw the new clause I, too, rejected the Opposition's motives in tabling it, and I agree with the robust language used by my hon Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) in giving his view of the matter. If one looks at the previous debate—it is relevant because the identical wording in that Bill is identical to that in the new clause—it seems astonishing that a matter of such great concern to the Opposition should have led so few of them to say here on a Friday afternoon to vote on it. About 37 Members voted in favour of the closure. One Labour Member spoke and did not even wait for the vote. It is constantly put before us that the Labour Party has a majority of 44 seats in Scotland, but, with a few honourable exceptions, those hon Members were lamentably lacking in their attendance at that debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the speech of the right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart)—on the Floor of the House —my hon Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker) referred to this—I asked whether the right hon Gentleman meant education in
	<span class='label label-info column'>900</span>
Gaelic or the teaching of Gaelic. As my hon Friend said, the right hon Member replied:"That is a fair point".—
	<i>[Official Report,</i> 13 February; Vol. 998, c. 1090.] I have listened to the debate this afternoon, and I am still confused about exactly what it is sought to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I looked at the new clause, I thought that there was in it an element of a token gesture towards the acceptance of the Gaelic language. I believe that the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) thought that this would be an opportunity to provide, as it were, a Second Reading debate on the issue, but we have been at it now for nearly two hours and it is still unclear what is being proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what is proposed is education in Gaelic, and if, as the clause says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty … to provide education in Gaelic",</p></blockquote>
that duty can be enforceable only by parents having rights, or by some other body, and requiring that education in Gaelic be provided in the Gaelic-speaking areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to take on board that change in the educational structure in Scotland, we must realise that it is a major change indeed, and I should like to see it given the widest possible consideration. That was why I voted for the closure on the Second Reading of the Bill introduced by the right hon Member for Western Isles, but we have not advanced our understanding of what is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the debate on the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the rector of a school in Scotland, who takes a great interest in these matters, though not in my constituency, asked me to send him a copy of 
	<i>Hansard,</i> which I did. Having read all the Second Reading speeches, he made the interesting point that not one hon Member had referred to the Irish experience following the introduction of the compulsory requirement to teaching in Gaelic in that country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not an educationist, but I understand from those concerned with the introduction of bilingualism into education that serious problems are involved, not least in the teaching of scientific subjects. It may be a superficial observation, but the very element of compulsion has probably meant that the language in the Republic of Ireland has declined even more rapidly than it has in either Wales of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to deal with the broader issues of education in Gaelic, I feel that we have not done justice to the subject either in this Bill or in the previous measure to which I have referred. We ought to look carefully at the experiment to which my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire referred, which is being carried out in the Western Isles with financial support from the Scottish Office. Once we know what is happening there, if it is feasible and desirable to introduce this element of compulsion I should be prepared to do so, and I understand that the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire would also be prepared to consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that those who have introduced this proposal will not think that we are antagonistic towards the idea of doing what we can to sustain the Gaelic language. However, at the end of a long Committee stage we cannot casually impose fundamental obligations in education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>:As one of those who stayed for the Second Reading debate on the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, on 13 February—although I did not participate—and voted against the closure, I feel that Opposition Members will give Government Members every cause and every facility to live up to their bold assertion that they wish to encourage the development of the Gaelic language in Scottish schools. I am not the Whip for this side of the Committee, but I have the feeling that we shall not push this matter to a Division now but will bring it back on Report. We shall make certain that Tory Members are given the opportunity to put their votes where their words have been this afternoon. If we have the wording wrong now, whether it should be "of" or "in", we shall have that corrected by Report. There will then be no excuse whatsoever not to support our proposal.

I am pleased to support the clause as it stands, just as I supported the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that was introduced by the right hon Member for Western Isles on 13 February, and just as I gave my support to the Ten-Minute Bill introduced by the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Walker). We must be seen to be making every attempt to show people in Scotland who wish to encourage the Gaelic language that those of us who are responsible for legislating for education in Scotland are concerned and are trying to move towards them.

No one in Committee will deny that Scotland is a nation. That can be seen from the many distinctive features of its rich and diverse culture. It is important for Committee members to take note of those features and to see Gaelic in its true perspective within the culture of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain special features within the Labour movement are Scottish in their entirety—for instance, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, which people tend to think is an extension of the Trades Union Congress, but which is a separate body and has been so for many years. Trade unions in the Labour movement in Scotland felt that the Scottish voice was missing from the Trades Union Congress, and so the Scottish Trades Union Congress was formed.

One has only to go to Hampden Park or attempt to get a ticket for the England v Scotland game to realise that, in the eyes of the working people, the Scottish football team represents working-class aspirations. It would be an extremely brave man who would wish to deny Scotland the cultural heritage of its football team.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman may or may not be correct, but at least it makes the effort. It represents— whether it is good, bad or indifferent—the overwhelming majority of football supporters in Scotland. I am certain that those supporters would not wish to see the Scottish team disappear into an overall British team. I should certainly oppose any effort to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Gaelic speakers regard Gaelic as their language —we certainly regard it as part of our culture—and we must take note of their aspirations and assist them to
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
provide an extension of Gaelic wherever we possibly can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You may not be aware of it, Mr. Hunt, but there are clear differences between the Highlands and the Lowlands of Scotland. Whilst the differences may not be so obvious, the basic identity of the Scottish nation is contained within those two areas.

I do not believe that there is one Committee member who can honestly say that he can either speak or even understand Gaelic. He may know one or two words— usually the ones that we use at New Year. However, one of the problems in Committee is that there are no Gaelic speakers. If any of us lapsed into Gaelic, I am sure that you would bring us instantly to order, Mr. Hunt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want a debate about that, Mr. Hunt. The Minister tried to express his understanding of the needs of people who wish their children to learn Gaelic, but I wonder how far that extends. For instance, how many people in the Scottish Education Department can speak Gaelic? Is there any positive determination, rather than positive discrimination? I know that Conservative Members do not like positive legislation in that sense, but when recruiting people to the Scottish Education Department is there a positive determination to ensure that those recruits can understand and speak Gaelic? If we could be sure that it exists, we might feel a little less afraid that the Scottish Office is opposed to any attempt to extend the Gaelic language. I am sure that Gaelic speakers would wish to know how many Scottish civil servants can speak or understand Gaelic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one meets Gaelic speakers—I think that the right hon Member for Western Isles is perhaps the best example—one finds that they are pleasant, well-mannered people, and if they wish to stress their nationalism through their language I do not object or seek to prevent that. I would seek to encourage it rather than have their nationalism expressed in another way, which might mean their committing a breach of the peace or undertaking or some other undesirable activity. We must assure them that they can rely on Parliament to ensure that the Gaelic language is given every opportunity to grow within the community itself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We find ourselves in a similar situation today. The new clause would give Gaelic is proper place in today's society and attempt to destroy the myth peddled by many people that there is one unique Scottishness that somehow unites those who own and control Scotland and those who actually work and provide the basis of life and sustenance there. I do not agree with that feeling, nor am I a nationalist in the sense that, although the original Bill was presented to the House by a member of the Scottish National Party, I should wish to associate myself with the narrow chauvinistic approach to the Scottish nation that the SNP adopts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am proud of the Scottish culture and of my Scottishness, but as a Scottish working-class person I feel that I have much more in common with the English working class than with those who own the largest amount of land and control society in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee or to strain your patience, Mr. Hunt.

What we would like to see is the Gaelic language being given every opportunity to flower and grow in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have the wording wrong on this occasion, we shall return to it on Report and will not allow Conservative Members who have expressed their support for the Gaelic language and Scottish culture to jump off the hoop as easily as the hon Member for Argyll has done with his amendments, none of which he has forced to a vote, and on only one has he managed to elicit from the Minister any indication that it might be included at a later stage. The Opposition will give the Conservatives an opportunity to support the Gaelic language in a manner that will not allow them to hide behind the words "of" or "in".

There has been considerable debate on the word "Perthshire". Under the local government reorganisation, part of Perthshire came under the Tayside region. Knowing the Tayside regional council and its approach to education within the region, I am concerned to ensure that the legislation is secure with regard to the provision of Gaelic and the need to provide for those parents who wish to see their children educated in Gaelic. I have been in correspondence with Tayside regional council's department of education on this matter. It has assured me that it will make every endeavour to provide Gaelic wherever it is required, but I should prefer to see these matters put into legislation. Having had experience of Tayside regional council's determination to cut back on public expenditure, I should not want simply to rely on its word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) accepts that there are schools in the Tayside region that teach Gaelic—that is, they are not teaching in Gaelic, but teaching the language.

Enough has been said today to demonstrate that there is genuine concern to support the Gaelic language as part of Scottish cultural heritage. I am certain that when we return to this matter on Report Government Members will join us in supporting an amendment that will be correctly worded to ensure that use of the language will grow in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate, which has been longer than some of us had expected. It has been welcome none the less, and it has been more constructive than was our discussion on 13 February. We tabled the new clause in the form in which it appears on the amendment paper simply to provide the opportunity for Conservative Members to make amendments of the sort to which they have alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) had every opportunity to amend the new clause in order to make the changes that he wants. His speech was a little short on content and guidelines, but it was pretty strong on abuse, as was that of the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire. I suspect that we scratched a raw nerve in both instances. Everyone here takes second place to the hon Gentlemen in their pursuit of headlines. If they cannot get them by other means, they use such terms as "hypocrisy", "dishonesty" and "lack of taste".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to give credence to what the hon Gentlemen said by developing that line, but I should like briefly to reply to the points made by the hon Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser), who was characteristically constructive in his approach. I take his point about education "in" and "of". One should realise that there are parts of Scotland where education in Gaelic is appropriate—certainly at primary school level—and that the medium of instruction and expression should be in that language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The phrase "in Gaelic" does not preclude education by use of certificate subject. Our only misgiving about education "of" Gaelic is that—as my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) said— a problem might be created with regard to certificate subject for less able children whose home language is Gaelic and whose parents want them to speak the language at school until their adolescence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know the full extent of such a demand. To take up the point of the Under-Secretary of State, the hon Member for Edinburgh, North (Mr. Fletcher), it would be difficult to judge that other than recourse to the courts for an interpretation of the issue, but no education authority would try to abdicate its responsibilities if there were a substantial number of parents who wanted their children educated "in" the language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take what was said about the Irish experience. Although I did not refer to that, I mentioned something closer to home—namely, the Welsh experience. I know about that from my family background. My sister-in-law is a teacher in a predominantly Welsh-speaking area, and her experience is not a particularly happy one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the dangers of coercion and overkill in that area, and I referred to them on Second Reading. I did not talk about the Irish experience because I do not believe that it is in any way analogous to either the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
Scottish or Welsh experiences. As far as I remember, the Irish experience is that Irish is compulsory. It is not the medium of instruction, but is a subject in the curriculum, put there, quite clearly, for political reasons in order to reinforce the sense of Irishness after 1920, and one can understand the reasons for that. However, that is certainly not the road along which we wish to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are motives that can be attributed to the Labour Party in the new clause, one motive is that we believe that no party in Scotland has a monopoly of concern for the culture of our nation. We were happy to support the Bill of the right hon Member for Western Isles (Mr. Stewart) and to table the new clause because we wanted to make it clear that there is no party in Scotland that had a monopoly of that concern. Equally, I shall not say that there is no concern whatever in the Conservative Party, because I recognise that some of its members are anxious about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the "of" or "in" aspect, we are happy to keep the preposition "in", for the reasons that I have given. With regards to the geographical aspect and the nomenclature of particular areas of Scotland, I should be more than happy to delete any reference to Inver-gowrie or that part of Dundee district that is in the constituency of the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be happy if Strathardle and Glenshee were not included and some sort of grey area status were given to Alyth in Perth and the area for Perth grammar school until such time as the voluminous researches of the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire have been completed. We do not believe that the new clause is an abuse of the Committee procedure. The fact that we have had a fairly healthy debate for the past two hours has evidenced the degree of interest in the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point that we made initially. We introduced the new clause because we felt that the matter had not been properly treated on Second Reading, when there was a closure motion. If one examines the list of those who voted on the closure motion, it is fair to say that those who were opposed to it were, in the main, long-standing campaigners against seat belts and wanted to prolong the discussion on the Gaelic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in order to talk out the Private Member's Bill on seat belts, introduced by my hon Friend the Member for Hudders-field, East (Mr. Sheerman).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, in the main, that was the reason for what happened. I realise that there are those whose opposition took a different form, and I leave them to their consciences to work out the political positions which they afterwards adopted. We acted for two motives: first, to give support and sustenance to the Gaelic language; secondly, to establish the point— which I believe we have done, without question—that the Labour Party, as much as any other party in Scotland, is concerned about an important and significant part of our cultural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to consider the matters raised by the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East, regardless of the offensive way in which he sought to make his points. I am willing to meet the hon Gentleman after the Committee rises to discuss the sort of amendments that he
	<span class='label label-info column'>906</span>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 3 is important. With no disrespect to Gaelic-speaking areas, the clause affects the whole of Scotland—every school, every part—whether the people speak Gaelic, English or anything else. It refers to the appointment of head teachers and other senior appointments, but it is to the appointment of head teachers that I particularly wish to speak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appointment of a head teacher is the most important appointment that an education authority can make. I think that it is one of the most important for the school. With no disrespect to the building of the school —I am always keen to see the development of newer and better school buildings—or to the other staff who are equally important to the team, the head teacher very often sets the seal on the development of a school. Certainly I have seen schools transformed by new head teachers. In many cases schools that may not be progressing well achieve a new dynamism and enthusiasm, which affects all the staff, including non-teaching staff as well as the parents and pupils, when a new head teacher is appointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My new clause is meant to be in line with the philosophy that the Government always assure us is behind what they suggested earlier. They produced a parents' charter for the individual placement of pupils, but I suggest that, to be genuine, a parents' charter must go well beyond the placement of the son or daughter of the parents concerned, which is why in this most important element of a school—the appointment of the head
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>907</span>
teacher and the teaching staff—parents should be allowed to play a role and to participate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a previous occasion when I was arguing for this in terms of the examination board, some understandable criticism was levelled at me by hon Members opposite and, indeed, by one or two of my hon Friends, on the ground that it is difficult to identify parents, to say who they are and how they can be represented on a national body. In terms of an individual school there is no difficulty whatsoever. There is a clearly identifiable body of parents, who, I suggest, are concerned parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two aspects here: first, the practical aspect and, secondly, the principle. It may be suggested that in practice this is a difficult proposal to implement. I hesitate to mention Lothian region, because I know that the Minister, his hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton) and one or other Members act in an almost Pavlovian manner whenever anyone does so. I ask them to cast aside their prejudices and concern and to think solely of the practical operation of new clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a number of years now in the Lothian region parents have been involved in these appointments. I shall not go into more detail because, Mr. Hunt, you asked me to be brief and in view of your earlier kindness when I made an error I shall stick to your request. But I submit that the fact that it can be done, and that it has been shown that it can be done in the Lothian region, indicates that there should be no problem in making it a statutory provision in any other region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Teachers have objected in the past. I and others are always willing to consider objections put forward by teachers. But experience in the Lothian region has proved all their objections to be fallacious. Teachers were worried about confidentiality and about personal information being divulged outwith the selection committee. That did happen once but the parent was not involved in the appointment. There was no question that the parent had divulged personal information. It was certainly my experience and, I think, that of my successor and colleague and former colleagues of the Lothian region that parents are very scrupulous about non-disclosure of confidential information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have shown that it is practically possible. Now we come to whether it is desirable. I suggest that it is desirable in principle for the very reason of involving parents in the appointment and giving them more responsibility. But above all, we in the local authority found that it built up a new sort of positive relationship between the parents, who are representative and usually authoritative, influential people within the school community, and the head teacher and his or her staff. We found that there was greater confidence in the newly-appointed head teacher when parents had been involved in the appointment. They felt a greater degree of commitment than if they had not been involved in the appointment. That seems to be an important argument in favour of involving parents. Therefore, I hope that, briefly and without skimping over the argument, because it is an important issue, I have indicated that this course of action is practical and desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept that this is not, again, a party political issue; it is not a major revolution in Scottish education but it is a suggested positive move towards involving parents in a meaningful
	<span class='label label-info column'>908</span>
way in something in their own school with which they can clearly identify and which will encourage a greater degree of parental involvement in the children's education, which is something, after all, that Government Members are always asking us to encourage. This is an opportunity for them. I hope that they will grasp it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to support my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes). Various education authorities seem to have different ways of selecting people for promotional posts, including head teachers. Some have committees or sub-committees consisting of councillors. Others may have subcommittees consisting not only of councillors but, perhaps, the head teacher of the school concerned if it is a head of department job which is being filled, and some have the subject adviser in the case of a head of a specialist subject department. But I see no reason why parents should not be involved. In fact, my hon Friend has outlined several positive reasons why parental involvement is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to work well in the Lothian region to which he referred. I know of other areas where the school council is involved in the appointment of ancillary, non-academic staff. The proposal is simply an extension of that principle—to say that schools are public property and that parents should be involved in their running and have some say in the appointment of senior staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has repeatedly referred to the Bill as a parents' charter. It is in the spirit of parental involvement and extension of parental rights that we support the new clause. It would lead to a far more democratic system of appointing senior staff and to greater accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is especially important in respect of head teachers. A head teacher can make or break a school. In a sense, I believe that they have far too much power, and if we could make them accountable in some way to parents and pupils that would be all to the good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, as well as a more democratic system of selecting head teachers, I am in favour of re-selection— or even de-selection. I feel that there should be a fixed-term contract of, say, five years, like the maximum term for an MP between elections. If they measure up to the job, they can be reappointed; if not, they should be sacked and replaced. That would go a long way to making head teachers more accountable. I hope to return to the issue on Report. My hon Friend's new clause is completely reasonable, and I hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we considered the appointment of the head teacher of a university we agreed that the system should be reformed, but we have not examined the position of senior teaching staff in schools. I am grateful to my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) for introducing his new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience, the system worked reasonably well in Lothian region. I can foresee certain difficulties in areas where the local authority's school council structure is somewhat different, but that is no reason for rejecting the new clause. The Minister could take it away and doctor it to produce something in a more satisfactory form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many local authorities now have a system whereby not only the administrative staff—that is, the directorate and its advisers—but political figures in the form
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>909</span>
of elected councillors are involved in the appointment of the higher echelons of school administration, there should also be some involvement by the parents. We do not suggest that they take part in the short-listing, which is a technical job, but only in the interviewing. That may be merely a token involvement, but in my experience as a member of a school council when such an appointment was made in a primary school, the parents approached the job in a responsible manner and took it seriously. They were fully aware of the protocol involved in the appointment of anyone to a position of authority and responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The experience in Lothian region has been that the system costs nothing—there has been no impact on the rates—and that it is satisfactory. We believe that the scheme could be extended to other Scottish local authorities through the new clause. We realise that some authorities may not have considered the proposal, and it might be argued that it would be better to give them the power. But they have the power; we should like to see a duty placed on them. If parental rights are to be extended, that should also apply to the appointing of the senior staff of schools. We assume that in primary schools that would mean head teachers and in secondary schools assistant head teachers and above.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause is an excellent suggestion from the fertile imagination of my hon Friend the Member for South Ayrshire. We look forward to hearing what the Minister says on the matter. We hope that he accepts the new clause. If not, we shall have to reconsider the position and perhaps force the issue to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:This an appropriate issue with which to bring our discussions to a close. We have come a long way in the past few weeks. When I find, to my great joy, that the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) and some of his hon Friends are advising the Committee about the customers for our schools, about consumer interests and the need for parents to be involved and considered in questions of this kind and other matters relating to schools, I know that progress has been made in terms not only of the Bill but of the exchange of arguments that has taken place, and that the past few weeks have not been wasted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) I say that although the matter he raised about fixed-term contracts for senior posts and head teachers is not covered by the new clause, it is something that I consider important, not only in education but throughout local government. The difficulty is that people enter as teachers, architects, directors of finance or whatever and, once in, no matter how well or otherwise they may perform—they might come in in their early or mid-thirties or even earlier—they are there and secure for the rest of their career. As the hon Gentleman ought to know, local authorities have difficulty in being able to recognise and dismiss a teacher who is very much below performance, and with about 55,000 teachers in Scotland there must be some who are not up to the desired standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are wider questions, but there is a great deal of agreement on them across the Committee. Whether an opportunity will arise on Report for some of these ideas to be reconsidered I do not know, but they are certainly
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
matters of great interest. It is perhaps a pity that the Opposition did not table amendments, because there is clearly agreement across the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say to the hon Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Foulkes) that the law of Scotland recognises no such body as a local education authority. These creatures are found only south of the border. I am surprised that, with his great experience of Scottish education, the hon Gentleman and some of his colleagues were apparently not aware of that. I am not talking so much of the details of amending the new clause as of the importance of recognising the different definitions that exist north and south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the substance, I fully appreciate the point made by the hon Gentleman and his hon Friends about involving parents in senior appointments. It is not only Lothian that has made use of school councils to make this possible. Grampian is another authority that has made some progress along these lines. I welcome that, because I feel that it is an enlightened way to involve parents, as the hon Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where I must disappoint the hon Gentleman is that it seems to me quite unnecessary to legislate on the matter. We spent time throughout out consideration of the Bill giving education authorities freedom to organise the education service in the manner that best meets local needs and circumstances. For example, one of the most important provisions in clause 6 is the devolving to local authorities complete responsibility for schemes of provision, as they are called, organising the intake arrangements to the schools and other such matters, and school closures. Such progress and improvement in education and the administration of education as we are making in the Bill would be reversed if we laid down that parents, through schools councils or in some other way, had to be involved by statutory requirement in such decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister agree that the examples to which he is referring are organisational examples not involving parents? In the one case involving parents— the choice of school for the individual child—he has asked us to put a statutory requirement on the local authority with regard to placement. That is the point that we were discussing earlier. This is the other matter involving parents. Surely, it is consistent with that part of what the Minister called the parents' charter to add this provision to it. Has not this more in common with that aspect than with the aspects to which he is now referring?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:No, because I think that this is more related to school management. This is a modest provision compared to the amendment that was tabled this morning by the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) about the election of university principals. That involved thousands of people and, as I suggested, perhaps the use of trade union block votes. This is still a matter of school management and of how best to employ the services of the schools councils. It would involve mainly schools councils—I was about to say "and organisations of that kind"—but it would be mainly a matter of involving schools councils in the appointment of senior staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that such a development is taking place as schools councils develop. Indeed, the Glasgow university report pointed to Lothian region, in particular,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>911</span>
for the way in which the matter has been developed. Local authorities are not hindered from developing arrangements of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no benefit—indeed, I see disadvantages—in trying by legislation to lay a requirement on local authorities in all cases, regardless of the stage of progress that they have made with schools councils or anything else, to act in this way. For that reason, I am sorry to have to tell the hon Gentleman and my hon Friends that I cannot accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hunt. Before we bring our proceedings to a close, I thank you very much for looking after the Committee's affairs from time to time. It is not easy for an English hon Member to take charge of a Scottish Committee. Even though we do not speak in Gaelic, we are still a funny lot. I am sure that the experience was enlightening, too, and if it happens to you again in the future you will benefit from the experience that you have enjoyed here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I express, too, our appreciation to Mr. Gourlay for the time that he has spent looking after the Committee's affairs. I am not sure whether it is easier for an English or a Scottish hon Member to control a Scottish Committee. A Scottish hon Member may be more familiar with our ways of doing things, which may be an advantage. On the other hand, we are more familiar with him, too, which may be to his disadvantage. I am most grateful to you, Mr. Hunt, and to Mr. Gourlay for
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
the patience and courtesy that you have both extended to every member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also express my appreciation to the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill). I promise that I shall not tell his constituents so, but he has been extremely courteous and helpful in all the arrangements for running the Committee. The so-called usual channels have, I am happy to say, been greased by the instant Whip, the hon Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan), in his new, comfortable, almost cuddly style. Despite his ferocious bark the hon Gentleman has proved himself an hon Member and a gentleman. I was delighted to find that he shook hands with my hon Friend the Government Whip, and that arrangements were made on that basis from time to time. That must be a new chapter in the record of the hon Member for West Stirlingshire. I thank my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton), the Government Whip, too, for looking after not only the Government side, but the whole Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. On behalf of the Opposition, I would add that although, obviously, we are not happy with the outcome of the Committee's proceedings, we are grateful for your stewardship? We share the views of the Under-Secretary of State about the problems confronting an English hon Member coming into a Scottish Committee. I hope that you, Mr. Hunt, and Mr. Gourlay, too, will be able to enjoy a rest from Scottish legislation. I hope that I shall be able to do so, too. Like some Government Back Benchers, I have been attending the First Scottish Standing Committee since Christmas, so I am looking forward to a rest. I hope that the recess will give you an opportunity to recharge the batteries. We are most grateful for your assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the Minister for not being quite as discourteous all the time as he often was, and that his gratuitously-offensive remarks were not sustained throughout our proceedings. We are grateful, too, to the pugilistic Whip who shortened the proceedings by threatening Conservative hon Members with God knows what to keep them quiet. We only wish that he had allowed them more freedom to vote as their consciences clearly prompted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) for his flexible handling of the Opposition side of the Committee—I do not use the word "liberal" with reference to my hon Friend. On our side the Committee has been a fairly happy one, although we are caused some anxiety by the fact that we did not win one vote, and obtained no concessions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We obtained one concession at a late hour. Perhaps we should be thankful for small mercies. I put on the record, too, that the remarks made at various times about the availability or otherwise of 
	<i>Hansard</i> were not intended as any reflection on the Official Reporters, for whose services we are most grateful. We are grateful, too, for the services of the Clerk, which were especially helpful to me as I was a fledgling in terms of drafting amendments. I hasten to add that the Clerk did not act above or beyond the call
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>913</span>
of duty, but gave assistance on occasion when it was necessary. On behalf of the Opposition, Mr. Hunt, I wish you a long and comfortable recess.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. I add briefly my words of gratitude to the expressions of my hon Friend? We realise what a difficult job both you and Mr. Gourlay have had in presiding over a Committee containing the worst ministerial team in the history of the Scottish Office. Unfortunately, the Committee has just approved one of the worst pieces of legislation in the history of Scottish education—but thank you, anyway, Mr. Hunt. You have done a difficult job, and we appreciate how difficult it must have been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gordon Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. I hope that it is in order for me, representing the independent voice of the Opposition, to say a brief "Thank you" to you for administering our affairs. We hope that it has been an education to you.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hunt. On behalf of the Back
	<span class='label label-info column'>914</span>
Benchers, especially the new boys, may I say that we have learnt a great deal both from yourself and from Mr. Gourlay. Your kindness is exceeded only by your good nature in the way that you have handled the Committee. I also thank the policemen who have been on duty and have kept the public off our backs on the odd occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is beginning to sound like polling night. On behalf of my co-chairman and myself I thank the Under-Secretary and the hon Member for Clackmannan and West Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) for their kind remarks, and the other Committee Members for the way in which they received them. As a mere Sassenach I have found the Committee both an experience and an education. I hope to repeat such an experience in due course, but not, I trust, immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
