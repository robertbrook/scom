	<p>
	<div class='member'>THE MINISTER OF STATE, MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE,FISHERIES AND FOOD (Mr. E. S. Bishop)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Eggs Authority (Rates of Levy) Order 1979 (S.I. No. 257).</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether the hon Member for Bodmin (Mr. Hicks) wishes to open on this prayer. If he cares to do so, it may be for the convenience of the Committee if I were to answer later any points arising in the ensuing debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.31 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hicks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have no intention of delaying the Committee longer than necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two years have elapsed since the industry was characterised by certain trials and tribulations. At that time there was considerable conflict and diversity of opinion as to what was best for its future. That divergence of opinion centred largely on the problems associated with sales promotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have little doubt that there is still a difference of opinion as to where emphasis should be placed in respect of brand advertising or generic advertising. But it seems that as a result of the inquiry and of the actions taken by the various organisations and sectors within the egg industry, all are anxious to encourage the egg industry as a whole, and these differences are now taking second place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is for that reason that, on this morning of great significance, we have been put in Room 14. Whatever happens in the House this evening and whatever the consequences of it, I hope that the Minister and I will both be here next year
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
to continue this dialogue, if only for our personal individual pairing arrangements that have characterised the other weeks of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask the Minister of State to comment upon the order. Under the revised budget of the Eggs Authority, the levy is raised from £4.35 per 100 chick placings to £6.20. That is a significant increase. It would be helpful if the Minister could make certain observations. Of the budget of £3.1 million, £2.3 million would be given over to advertising. That leads me to my second point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather that this increase is largely to enable the authority to carry out a more extensive advertising programme in the first half of 1979–80 in the light of the results of a double weight test that has been carried out in Scotland and the Border Television area. We ask the Minister to elaborate a little, particularly with regard to the cost-effectiveness of that advertising campaign. On initial consideration, it seems that the proportion being spent may not be justified by the increase in sales of eggs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one is disputing that the industry must have the money to advertise. But I think that the Minister would also agree that we in the House of Commons have an obligation to see that public money is spent as effectively as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third point is that I gather that the level of consumption is running consistently, both this year and last, at approximately 249 eggs per head of population per annum. What worries Conservatives somewhat is that such a level implies a production of some 14,000 million eggs, although the number of chick placings is falling. Therefore, what does the Minister feel about future supplies of eggs? There is the question of the import of eggs from Europe. I recall, as no doubt the Minister will, certain incidents two or three years ago when French eggs were being imported. I know that this time, if there were a shortfall in the United Kingdom, it would be for a different reason, but it is an aspect which gives rise to concern, particularly for the consumer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one final question to put to the Minister. We were all agreed in this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0478">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Committee last year that it was desirable to have closer liaison between the Eggs Authority and the various sectors of the industry. As I said earlier, such a liaison appears to be taking place. We welcome that trend, because no one wants to go back to the situation that existed two or three years ago. Therefore, what action or prompting is the Minister's Department conducting behind the scenes, as it were, to try to maintain the more favourable environment which has undoubtedly been created, particularly bearing in mind that the number of holdings within the industry is declining at a rate of 5 per cent, to 10 per cent, a year? By definition, a greater concentration of egg production must now be in the hands of the major producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those four points in mind, on which Conservative Members require clarification and a degree of explanation, which would be helpful not only to the Committee but to the egg industry as a whole, I have pleasure in supporting a renewal of the Eggs Authority (Rates of Levy) Order 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.38 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Colin Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend the Member for Bodmin (Mr. Hicks) for raising the four specific points that I had distilled out of this order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to take this opportunity of congratulating the Eggs Authority on the remarkably constructive attitude which it has brought to bear on the question of eggs since the change of management. It has gone out of its way to keep Parliament and the parties in Parliament aware of what it is doing and it has been very successful in its development of a closer liaison with the various interests in the egg industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I saw the increase in levy this year, my first reaction was one of "Wow! An increase of 42½ per cent, will really bring the ducks off the water and the anguish will fly in all directions." It was with some relief that I found that there was no opposition to the increase. I have not yet found any opposition from any sectors of the trade, which underlines the close liaison developed by the Eggs
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Authority with the various elements making up the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can see, what it boils down to is the fact that we have a massive over-productive phase in the egg industry. The total industry seems to be getting together to try to conquer this phase by a positive marketing effort, which is to be applauded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see from the information which the Eggs Authority has given me that sales are running at 861 million dozen a year, having climbed from the trough of 1976. At one point, in 1970, the figure was as high as 912 million dozen, which at least sets the target of what is attainable in the industry, given effective marketing. Without any doubt, that is the challenge. If the marketing is effective, the industry will be able to fulfil that market without resorting to imports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish television experiment seemed somewhat expensive, but I was eventually convinced that there was a positive benefit as a result. I should like to see this extended because it is one way of developing the overall awareness of eggs as being a convenience food, especially in the light of their comparative —although I do not think that anyone in the high street would agree with me— cheapness in real terms compared with 1968 prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of brand awareness, I believe that several moves can be made. I was interested to read in last week's Economist of an American millionaire who had made his fortune by making chickens more marketable. I have chicken producers in my constituency. Sun Valley is one of the largest and most effective broiler fowl producers in the country. It is also a growing and developing company. The American millionaire to whom I have referred discovered that, for some reason of which I am not aware, chickens with yellow skins seemed to sell better off-the-shelf in the United States than did chickens with white skins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an ordinary consumer of eggs, I take the view that an egg with a deep, rich orange yolk is very much nicer on my breakfast plate than one with an insipid yellow yolk. It seems to me that if the feeding of hens can be developed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0479">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
properly so that they produce deep orange or deep yellow yolks, there is scope here for brand awareness. I can imagine the slogan: "For the deeper yellow yolk, buy Brand X". People will be able to develop their own brands in that particular way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a pleasure to be able to speak constructively today about the Eggs Authority and the egg industry as a whole. I look forward to seeing the industry develop in the coming year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.43 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the debate has been useful because it has reached the main points which are under discussion today. I should like to echo the tributes that have been paid to the authority for the contribution that it has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Eggs Authority has between 12 and 14 members appointed by agriculture Ministers—namely five producers, four trade members and between three and five independent members, which include the chairman, the deputy chairman and a person conversant with consumer interests. Such bodies are often criticised these days, but I should point out that members of the authority serve on a part-time basis, normally for a three-year period, in a purely personal capacity and not as nominees of any particular organisation, although organisations are asked to nominate suitable candidates when appointments are being considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authority performs a useful role. I echo the tribute to the chairman—Sir Guy Lawrence—and to the members and officers for the contribution that they make to what is an important part of our food industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to be able to speak on this order for the fourth year in succession. The hon Member for Bodmin (Mr. Hicks) referred to the future. It may well be that he and I will be here on the next occasion. But a lot will depend on the pecking order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been useful and helpful for me to follow through the fortunes of the authority and, over the years, to get to know some of the problems connected
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
with the industry and, of course, with the presentation of the levy. I am pleased about the welcome which has been given to the order, because it is essential to pass it so that the authority will have the wherewithal to perform its functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to comment briefly on the results of last year's review, to which reference has been made, and on some of the main factors which Ministers took into account in arriving at the decision to fix this year's levy at £6.20 per 100 chicks. I think that this is probably the best way of dealing with some of the general points that have been raised, and this approach will help to keep in perspective some of the more detailed matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned the authority's background, its membership, and so forth. Under the Agriculture Act 1970, the authority, covering the interests of all the sectors of the industry, is charged with the general responsibility of improving the marketing of eggs and promoting sales. To carry out those functions effectively, the authority's programme of work has included substantial advertising and the provision of market intelligence, as well as some research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Advertising and sales promotion—the main items of expenditure—are financed wholly by the industry levy. Market intelligence, research and development and general costs relating to those two functions are shared fifty-fifty between the industry and the Government. The Government, the authority and all the different interests concerned are thus working in close co-operation, with common objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of that co-operation was very much in Ministers' minds last year. The Committee will recall that, following last year's review of the authority's workings and of the contribution that it can make to the industry, there was general acceptance that it could continue to play a valuable role in improving the marketing of eggs. It was also recognised that the authority could best achieve that objective by maintaining its existing functions with the full support of all concerned. Those were the main conclusions to emerge, and I believe that they provide an essential background for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0480">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
consideration of the authority's budget for 1979–80.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authority has to work on its budget proposals well in advance of the financial year to which they relate. In developing its proposals for 1979–80, the authority paid special attention to advertising expenditure. There were differences of emphasis, to some extent, within the industry. The hon Members for Hereford (Mr. Shepherd) and for Bodmin made the point about brand and generic advertising. There has always been a difference of emphasis as to where priorities should go-However, the authority felt on balance —and particularly in the light of the double weight test in the Scotland and Border region—that provision should be made for an approximate doubling of TV advertising. That was reflected in the budget that it submitted to Ministers towards the end of last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Act, Ministers are required to consult the interests concerned, so that their comments can be taken into account before Ministers arrive at the precise amount to be raised. In that connection, the Committee will appreciate that, within an industry comprising over 70,000 producers—ranging from small producer-retailers to large integrated businesses— it is understandable that there should be a variety of views about the precise level of the authority's budget and how additional resources might best be deployed. Some of the organisations concerned supported the authority's original proposals—which were much larger than the amount that we are discussing today— without reservation. Others felt that changes in the market since the original proposals were prepared had a bearing on the actual resources likely to be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers recognised that the latest chick placing figures indicated that United Kingdom egg production in the latter part of 1979–80 was now expected to be less than originally envisaged. The essential advertising requirement was thus likely to be less than had been foreseen earlier. In the light of those consultations, Ministers felt that the most appropriate course was to fix the levy at £6.20 per 100 chicks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
We were satisfied that this would enable the authority to undertake a viable advertising programme, in line with market forecasts. It also takes account of the bad year that producers had last year and of the fact that, under the Act Ministers are required to set the levy at a level sufficient—but no more than sufficient—to meet the expenditure likely to be required for the year in question. The allocation of the resources available to the authority for advertising in 1979–80 —to which reference has been made—will be a matter for the authority, in the light of discussions with the various interests concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Conlan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While my right hon Friend is on that matter, I should like to point out that neither the statutory instrument nor the information that we have received from the National Farmers' Union indicates the total amount that the levy will raise in this particular year. Will he give the Committee some information about that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I hope to come on to that in a moment, when answering some of the questions put by other hon Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order provides for a levy of £6.20 per 100 chicks in 1979–80, based on an estimate of chicks placed of 46.55 million, to raise a sum of £2.9 million. The levy represents an increase of around 40 per cent, in money terms—or 27 per cent, in real terms—over the levy for 1978–79. That is equivalent to 0.3p per dozen eggs, which are currently retailing at an average of 54p a dozen. The increase is designed to improve sales promotion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon Members will realise the importance of keeping a balance. Last year there was an over-supply of eggs, and so advertising had to be much greater to take account of that. Since last year there has been a change in the number of chick placings. We are concerned with the amount of money that can reasonably be spent in the coming year, having taken that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the advertising element which has been referred to, the authority, in preparing its budget, has paid special attention to advertising expenditure in the light of the results of the double
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0481">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
weight test carried out in Scotland and the Border Television area. Results have shown that in that region, where television advertising has been double the level of that elsewhere, there has been a significant increase in sales compared with those in other regions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before submitting this proposal to Ministers, the authority considered the implications, in co-operation with the interests concerned. There were differing opinions as to the merit of such an increase and some wished the authority to increase its joint advertising—that is, generic advertising financed by the authority but linked to companies' brand advertising. The authority concluded that the right course was to make provision for the doubling of television advertising expenditure as in its original proposal. It made provision for some increase in joint generic-brand advertising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the need for the levy to be sufficient, but no more than sufficient, for the year's requirements. It was suggested by some organisations that the authority's proposals should remain unchanged and any savings be used to offset the rate of levy for 1980–81. We were unable to accept that suggestion as the Government are required, under the Act, to make an order determining such a rate of levy as would appear to be sufficient, and no more than sufficient, to meet the amount to be raised for that accounting period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The levy of £6.20 is apportioned as follows: £5.85 to advertising and £0.35 to other costs. That compares with £3.78 and £0.57 in the current year. The reduction in the levy for other costs has been possible because the increase in planned expenditure under this heading for 1979–80 is more than offset by a surplus of £131,000 accumulated on this side of the authority's account at the end of 1977–78.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in the advertising element reflects the proposed increase in activity in this area, including the authority's decision last year to allocate £220,000 to a point-of-sale promotion scheme for the period October 1978 to September 1979. It also takes into account the surplus of £88,000, on this side of the accounts, from earlier years, as shown in the 1977–78 published accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
On the state of the industry, to which reference has been made, the current value of the egg output in the United Kingdom is nearly £400 million at farm-gate. The total production for 1978 is expected to be slightly up on that of 1977, but a small decline is forecast for 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the industry for its valuable contribution to food supplies. As an industry, it has become more and more competitive, combining a great deal of research and development, and giving better value to consumers, especially in relation to alternative foods.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hicks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In agreeing that there is likely to be a reduction in the total output this coming year, due to the reduction in chick placings, is the Minister satisfied that there will not be any significant shortfall in terms of demand? If there is, where can that shortfall be made up? There is a problem here of advertising to promote sales but having also to be able to deliver the goods to meet the demand which results from the advertising. A potential dilemma appears to be developing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that. It is a matter of the authority keeping a close watch on market forces. The problem arises in other sectors, too. The result of over-production is a surplus, and so prices drop. Then the situation becomes uneconomic, and the result the following year may be that producers are more wary about their future supplies. There may then be a shortage. Therefore, it is a matter of working closely together and checking supply and demand.

The industry has an important part to play in this respect through the Eggs Authority. The review of egg prices each week takes into account such factors as the expected number of eggs going through the packing stations, information from retailers about unsold stock, implications of holidays, the possibility of imports, and the effect that price changes would have on demand.

The authority has an important role in market intelligence. As the hon Member implies, it is important that the industry, in its future forecasting, should recognise the need to keep a balance. That, of course, is not easy.

With regard to the future—here I make a brief reference to the CAP price proposals for 1979–80—eggs and poultry meat account for about 15 per cent, of the total agricultural output of the Community, and the CAP provides for a free market protected by variable levies and export refunds. While there are no specific proposals relating to eggs and poultry meat, a freeze on cereal prices would be useful to this sector both in the United Kingdom and the rest of the Community.

The green pound has not been mentioned this morning, although it may be a factor. It should be realised that agreement in principle has been reached in the Council on the 5 per cent, devaluation, but the time when it will come into effect has not been settled. I expect, however, that there will be further discussions in the Council this week.

Here again, one has to watch the matter carefully, because the cereal sector and cereal users could be affected to some extent, and that would offset any advantage in other ways.

I believe that those are the main points which were raised. In conclusion, I pay tribute again to Sir Guy Lawrence and the work of the authority. The authority co-operates very closely with all sectors of the industry—producers, packers and distributors—and with consumers. The work done, particularly on sales promotion, in providing reliable market intelligence is especially valuable and, in my view, it is of substantial benefit to all the various interests concerned in what is a major segment of our agriculture and food industry. I am very pleased that Opposition Members referred to the much closer co-operation between the authority and these interests. That co-operation has improved recently, and I am sure that it will continue.
