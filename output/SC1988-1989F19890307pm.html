	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Sir Paul, to the Chair of our Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we adjourned this morning I was explaining that the power that we were seeking to give to the OPB would assist it to provide for the forfeiture of members' pension rights on bankruptcy, which would be to the advantage of the member. Then the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) raised another circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Finance Act 1986 laid down additional requirements, which require schemes, as a condition of retaining full tax exemption, to ensure that their assets do not exceed 105 per cent, of their liabilities. To get rid of a surplus, schemes may increase benefits, introduce new benefits, provide a "contributions holiday", for employer and/or employees and make a refund of contributions to the employer, subject to tax 40 per cent. Some schemes are already able to use any of these options but scheme rules may not permit other schemes to do so. If their benefits are already at Inland Revenue maxima and therefore cannot be increased, they are unable to dissipate the surplus funds as the law requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the passage of the Finance Act, we undertook to bring in measures to enable schemes to apply to the OPB to modify its rules to permit it to use any of the available methods of disposing of the surplus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State referred draft regulations for this purpose to the Occupational Pensions Board. The board was legally advised that if the regulations were made, section 64(7) would still prevent the board from making any modification order. Accordingly, my right hon. Friend withdrew the draft regulations at a time that coincided with his reference to the OPB of a number of questions relating to the respective interests of employers and scheme members. The board's views in this field could have implications for the making of these regulations. The OPB's report "Protecting Pensions" was published on 1 February. No decisions including whether to make regulations in respect of the surplus issue will be taken on what, if any, action should be taken on the recommendations in the report until we have received comments which we have invited from interested persons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>990</span>
I can assure the Committee that the Government have no intention to use the regulation making power other than within strict and acceptable limits. Indeed, should any Government attempt to do otherwise, the OPB in reporting on the regulations would undoubtedly comment unfavourably upon the proposed use to be made of the powers. Nor, if called upon to exercise such powers, would they fail to take account, as they are required to do, of whether any modification was reasonable in all the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware of the importance of the point made by the hon. Member for Derby, South. It is vital to have guidance on how to reach a sensible and right decision in the interests of members, and of course employers in all the different circumstances and schemes. However, I am unable to say what those are, as we are as yet only part of the way through a consultation exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee might think that, of all the options open to the OPB to enable schemes in surplus to dissipate their surplus funds, the one that should not be open to it is to return some or all that surplus to the employer, even though it is at a tax rate of 40 per cent. That is not an option that I would close in every circumstance, for two reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is a considerable variation between different schemes. Secondly, the employer is liable, when schemes are short of funds, to meet their undertakings to members to make up the differences. The best and most suitable way to deal with a surplus may be a refund to the employer. That will not affect the employer's continuing responsibility to ensure that the obligations of the funds are met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot give a more complete answer at this stage. I hope that the Committee will understand that while we are in consultation, that is not possible. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Lady will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the Minister's observations about the advice that the OPB has received, which is contrary to the advice that we have received. It has been suggested to us that it is not necessary for the section to be changed to allow modifications such as the one, which the Minister described to tax relief, so that aroused our concern. However, if that is what the Occupational Pensions Board has been advised, that is a matter of interest in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary clarify one point? It was not wholly clear to me from what he said or from the board's report whether the board is seeking the new power that is being given, and to which we have made reference in the amendment, or whether it has identified a number of problems and believes that there should be changes without necessarily seeking the specific power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Lady whether it has specifically sought it, but I believe that on both sides it is understood that the board needs that power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That clarifies the position considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>991</span>
I understand why the Minister has to say that the Government have no intention of using the power except in circumstances of which everybody would approve, and if they tried to, the Occupational Pensions Board would make rude comments and that would have a major effect. Although the Minister did not actually say so, he implied that if the Occupational Pensions Board commented unfavourably, that would be a matter of considerable importance. While I agree that it should be a matter of considerable importance, some of the precedents are not encouraging. On many occasions, the Social Security Advisory Committee has commented unfavourably on Government proposals without it apparently having the slightest effect. Having placed it on the record that I do not share the Minister's touching confidence that his Government will listen to the Occupational Pensions Board, I hope that the assurances that he has given about the limited nature of the powers are justified. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 215, in page 42, line 23, after "schemes)", insert "(a)".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 216.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During our consideration of schedule 3 earlier today, we spent some time in the context of the EC directive looking at the issue of survivors' benefits under occupational pension schemes. As the Committee knows, the EC directive specifically excludes survivors' benefits from its requirements. We return to the issue of survivors' benefits, however, in the context of implementing not the directive, but a further stage of our own proposals in the field of equal treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 of Schedule 4 and amendments Nos. 215 and 216 make particular provision towards bringing the treatment of widowers into line with that for widows. We are not at this stage requiring schemes to provide widowers' benefits where they provide widows' benefits, nor that where they do provide widowers' benefits, they should be on the same terms as for widows' benefits. Nevertheless, these amendments follow the requirement that we introduced in the 1986 Act for schemes to provide widowers' benefits as a condition of contracting-out of SERPS, and demonstrate our ongoing commitment to bring about equality between the sexes in occupational pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 16 to the Social Security Act 1973 requires schemes to preserve the pension rights of those who leave their employment before their scheme's normal pension age provided they have two years' pensionable service. We have also introduced a requirement to revalue those preserved rights and have given members the right to transfer these rights to another scheme. Nevertheless, schedule 16 applies currently only to a member's rights to a pension on retirement and to a widows' pension on his death. We are extending that right to cover widowers' pensions on the same terms as widows' pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 215 and 216 make further cones-
	<span class='label label-info column'>992</span>
quential amendmetns to schedule 16. Currently, a man is permitted to assign part of his perserved retirment pension rights, or surrender some of them, to provide a pension for his widow. The Bill will give a similar right for a woman to assign, or surrender, some of her preserved pension rights to provide a pension for her widower. Widows' benefits may currently be commuted to a lump sum in exceptinal circumstances. That right will be available for widowers' benefits. Two other provisions currently available only in respect of widows' benefits will also be extended to widowers. These are the forfeiture of rights on bankruptcy to ensure that creditors are not able to get hold of the pension and the prohibition of schemes from depriving a widower of pension rights by reason of failure to claim or comply with some technical formality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are small but worthile changes. I hope that they will be welcomed by both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<i>Mr. Peter Lloyd.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 217, in page 45, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"12A.—(1) In section 52A of that Act (Secretary of State to specify revaluation percentage) in subsection (3) for the words from '.in the light' onwards there shall be substituted the words 'to be the percentage increase in the general level of prices obtaining in Great Britain during the period which is the reference period in relation to that revaluation period, estimated in such manner as he thinks fit.'</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) For subsection (8) of that section (calculation of revaluation percentage where price increases exceed 5 per cent per annum) there shall be substituted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(8) Where, apart from this subsection, the revaluation percentage in relation to a revaluation period would exceed the maximum rate, the Secretary of State shall instead specify as the revaluation percentage for that period a percentage equal to the maximum rate.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(9) For the purposes of subsection (8) above, "the maximum rate", in relation to a revaluation period, is—

	<ol>

	<li>in the case of a revaluation period of 12 months, 5 per cent; and</li>

	<li>in any other case, the percentage that would be the revaluation percentage had the general level of prices increased at the rate of 5 per cent compound per annum during the reference period in question.'.".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 217 makes two technical changes to the method of determining the percentage by which preserved pension rights must be revalued. Before the enactment of the Social Security Act 1985 there was no obligation on pension schemes to revalue the pension rights of those who left their employment before the scheme's normal pension age. Inevitably, the value of these rights would reduce over what could be 20 or 30 years between the date when the member left his employment and when the pension became payable. Schemes now have to revalue rights occurring from 1 January 1986 in line with price increases subject to a specified maximum which was intended to be 5 per cent per annum compound. This maximum figure was imposed to ensure that pension schemes which might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>993</span>
have no new members and relate to an employment which had ceased trading would be able to be adequately funded to meet their new statutory liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes two changes. First, it brings the basis for determining the revaluation percentage specified by the Secretary of State by order into line with uprating order for state benefits. Technically, if a reputable body currently provided the Secretary of State with figures for the rate of price increases which were higher or lower than published figures, he might be obliged to use them. It could be in the interest of the scheme's trustees for one set of figures to be used and in the interest of scheme members for another set to be used. Either group could take proceedings if its set of figures were not used. The first amendment enables the Secretary of State to choose the increase in the general level of prices
	<br><blockquote><p>'estimated in such manner as he thinks fit.'</p></blockquote>
This wording is identical to that for state benefit upratings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second change relates to the determination of the maximum cut-off point. The orginal wording was defective, resulting in a revaluation for one year in the 1988 order of 5.7 per cent. The defect resulted from the need to consider revaluations over a number of overlapping periods. The amendment will reinstate the 5 per cent maximum for future years and will ensure that schemes will not be faced with an obligation for which they are not funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the amendment to the committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 315, in page 45, leave out lines 35 to 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Occasionally, when we reach the schedules of Bills such as this, the relevant provisions bear no relation to reality. Schedule 4(16) refers to reciprocity with other countries. Some of us wondered which countries were meant. I thank the Government for providing us with the notes on clauses, which state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Paragraph 16 enables the Secretary of State to make payment of minimum contributions and incentive payments under Sections 3 and 7 of the Social Security Act 1986"—</p></blockquote>
those sections deal with what we refer to as the 2 per cent, bribe—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to schemes established outside the United kingdom on the basis of reciprocity. It is intended to use the power to establish a reciprocal agreement with the Isle of Man. In relation to any scheme established there before 6 April 1989 may be made for the period from 6 April 1987."</p></blockquote>
I was rather surprised that "other countries" meant the Isle of Man. It is wrong that contributions to the national insurance fund should be used to bribe people to exchange their state pensions rights for high-risk money purchase schemes in the United Kingdom. It is also wrong to extend the bribe to the Isle of Man, or anywhere else. In the United Kingdom, personal pension salesmen are subject to certain minimum controls, which offer some protection, however inadequate, to their potential customers. Will the same controls apply
	<span class='label label-info column'>994</span>
in the Isle of Man or in any other country with which the Government may be considering making a similar reciprocal agreement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may have no alternative to putting up with this system, but are the Government to export it in this manner? If so, as only the Isle of Man is mentioned in the notes on clauses, I should be interested to know what other countries may be involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is less in this provision than meets the eye. I shall not follow the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) by recapitulating our argument and I do not see how the excellent incentive for sensible arrangements over personal pensions can properly be described as a bribe. The proper terms is "incentive". In the few months that such an incentive has been available, more than 1 million people have taken advantage of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision that the hon. Gentleman would like to delete is quite straightforward. Section 143 of the Social Security Act 1975 enables effect to be given by Order in Council to certain reciprocal agreements, but there are doubts about whether that can be said to apply to occupational pension schemes. The proposed new subsparagraph 17A(1) will remedy that position. Our intention, which is mentioned in the notes on clauses, is to apply the provision simply to the Isle of Man. Broadly, the reciprocal social security agreement between the Isle of Man and Great Britain provides for equality of treatment for benefit and national insurance contribution purposes on moving between the two countries. For personal pension purposes, the spirit of reciprocity requires that minimum contributions could be paid to an Isle of Man approved appropriate personal pension scheme in respect of national insurance contributions paid in the United Kingdom and vice versa. There is no intention to use the power other than to amend the Isle of Man agreement. The hon. Gentleman asked that investor protection arrangements should be seen to apply to the Isle of Man. If at any future date there was a recipriocal arrangement with any other country, we should have to be satisfied on that score too. We only envisage using it for the Isle of Man. We do not have complete and adequate power to do so at present and this part of the schedule would enable us to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you would rule me out of order, Sir Paul, if I asked when an incentive was an incentive and when a subsidy was a subsidy or whether an incentive was a bribe. I prefer to stick to the words that I used—effectively, this is a bribe. That is the principle behind our proposal. I have never visited the Isle of Man and would like to make it plain that my reference to it contained no prejudice towards that part of the world at all. In case I am ever invited to the Isle of Man, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 325, in page 45, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"16A. In section 13 of that Act (Regulations as to form and content of advertisements)—

	<ol>

	<li>for the words "form and content of advertisements and such other material as may be prescribed issued" there shall be substituted the words "conduct of business";</li>

</ol></p></blockquote>
This matter could be of considerable importance, particularly to those individuals who may be tempted to take our personal pensions—as my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has just pointed out, the Government are attempting to bribe them to do this when in many cases that is not in their long-term interests—especially deposit-based personal pensions. I have corresponded with the Minister and his predecessor about this and the Association of British Insurers has also corresponded with the Department about it at some length and the matter remains unresolved. That is serious. Personal pensions have been on offer to the public since last July. The association contends—justifiably I believe—that the deposit-based personal pensions are not on offer on comparable terms with those provided by insurance companies and others, which is likely to disadvantage the individual who takes out such a personal pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument has been raised in a number of different ways. Are the advertising controls that apply to deposit-based personal pensions as stringent as they should be and as stringent as those which relate to other schemes? There is also the question of the power to regulate the marketing and selling and the compensation cover that is required by the providers of deposit-based personal pensions. It is not a matter simply of unfair competition, to use the favourite Common Market term, but of whether the protection that is provided for individuals who see advertisements for deposit-based personal pensions and find them attractive is adequate, bearing in mind that this is a different kind of product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Association of British Insurers suggests that the investor entering into a deposit-based personal pension is lacking real protection at the most crucial juncture of all—the point of sale. The association has been making representations and I wrote to the Department on a number of occasions, long before personal pensions eventually went on sale last July, and since then. As the Minister will recall, he replied that the Department intends to make some of these regulations in the near future. These regulations have still not been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little doubt that the regulations on advertisements and other promotional material are not in line with those required by either the Securities and Investments Board or the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation. In particular, inflation and growth rate assumptions do not have to be set out in the same way and the same amount of information does not have to be given, which means that potential investors cannot judge how they will be affected by taking one sort of personal pension as opposed to another. There is serious concern about whether the retirement income will prove to be adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of the differences between unit trust-based schemes, deposit-based schemes and other types of personal pension schemes. If something goes wrong with insured schemes, under the Policyholders Protection Act 1975 investors are entitled to com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>996</span>
pensation of 90 per cent with no limit on that sum. With unit trust schemes, under the Financial Services Act 1986, the compensating scheme will pay out full compensation up to £30,000 only, with 90 per cent on the balance between £30,000 and £50,000, making a maximum of £48,000 compared with a maximum of no limit. Under bank deposit schemes, which are governed by the Banking Act 1987, investors are entitled to the return of only 75 per cent of their protected deposits, including accrued interest, of the first £20,000 invested, making a maximum of £15,000. With building society deposit schemes, under the Building Societies Act 1986, investors are limited to maximum compensation of 90 per cent of a protected investment up to £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are substantial differences between the protection afforded to investors in different types of scheme. Ministers argue that these differences reflect the different characteristics of different schemes, but that should be made crystal clear to the potential investor. It is not just a matter of making it clear and letting the investor judge; more protection should be provided than seems likely to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that the respected pension commentator Eric Short said in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> some time ago:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the employee invests his contributions into a deposit-based personal pension for 30 years, then the odds are that he will finish up with an inadequate pension and wonder where he went wrong, believing that he had played safe by sticking to a risk-free investment."</p></blockquote>
That is what we have been saying to the Government since the beginning of the debate on the provision of personal pensions, particularly on the issue of deposit-based schemes. The Government persist in saying that there is not a major problem when so many experts are telling them that there is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is inadequate, and it is unacceptable that while those pensions have been on sale since last July, there has been a long delay in taking action, even of the sort that the Government agreed was necessary. We have moved an amendment in the form suggested by the Association of British Insurers in the hope of getting from the Government some action, instead of a lot of waffle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am glad that the Minister believes that the regulations will be introduced expeditiously, but as he has been saying that to me since last August, I do not find that statement as reassuring as I should like. It is outrageous that the Government have allowed the marketing of the pension schemes to go ahead since last July and are encouraging people—bribing people, as my hon. friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said—to place heavy reliance for the whole of their income in retirement on such schemes, when the Government know perfectly well that the information offered is not on all fours between different schemes and that the protection offered is not the same as between different schemes.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) A committee may refer to a social security appeal tribunal any question arising from a complaint made to them regarding entitlement to or the amount of a war pension if in their opinion it would be appropriate for such a tribunal to determine that question, and the decision of the tribunal shall be binding on the complainant and the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>998</span>
The amendment would enable a war pension committee to refer a question arising from a war pension case to a social security appeals tribunal, where it is considered appropriate to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, war pensions are governed by legislation separate from the main social security legislation. They are also administered separately in a way that, in terms of sympathy and understanding of the pensioner's point of view, is often more civilised than the treatment that many social security claimants receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
War pensions committees are an important part of the administrative machinery. Among other functions, they provide a channel for complaints about decisions made by the Department on entitlement to pensions. If a committee is satisfied that a complaint is justified, or needs further investigation, it can make representations to the Department. This civilised, informal procedure does not always result in justice being done. In some cases, access to an independent tribunal is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the example of a case with which I have been dealing for many years. Mrs. Orme is a constituent of mine. Her husband died in November 1976 and she was awarded a war widow's pension in November 1986, backdated to June 1986. She asked for it to be backdated to the time of her husband's death in 1976, but that was refused.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Orme had been a prisoner of war in Japan during the second world war. He applied for a war pension on two occasions but it was refused, even though he was granted a full pension during his stay in Mossley Hill hospital in Liverpool for three months during 1956. However, that ceased when he was discharged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter to me dated 20 August 1987, Lord Skel-mersdale, Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The authority under which the award is made provides that payment shall not normally be made for any period before the date of the successful application or appeal. The Secretary of State does have discretion to vary this but only in exceptional circumstances."</p></blockquote>
As I pointed out in my letter of 18 January 1988 to Lord Skelmersdale, schedule 3 to article 65 of the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc. (Disablement and Death) Service Pensions Order 1983 provides that if the pension is not claimed within three or, in some cases, six months of the husband's death, it is payable from the date of the claim
	<br><blockquote><p>"Except in so far as the Secretary of State may otherwise direct with respect to any particular case or class of case".</p></blockquote>
There is no mention of "exceptional circumstances" in schedule 3; the Secretary of State has unfettered discretion and there is no justification for limiting its exercise in that way. However, in his reply Lord Skelmersdale simply repeated his previous assertion that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State can only exercise his discretion to backdate claims if it can be shown that there were exceptional circumstances which prevented a claim being made earlier."</p></blockquote>
As it happens, Mrs. Orme's case was exceptional, but that is beside the point and I do not accept that those are valid grounds for refusing to backdate her pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there may be good reasons for not backdating some claims, for instance, claims for disable-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>999</span>
ment pensions that will depend on medical evidence that may be difficult to obtain, the problem does not arise in the case of a widow's pension. Once the cause of the husband's death has been established, it does not change over time. As it is accepted that Mrs. Orme is now entitled to a war widow's pension, there can be no doubt that she has been entitled to receive that pension continuously since her husband's death. The DHSS however, seems to have applied the same criteria to her request for backdating as it would in the case of a disablement pensions claim involving medical questions. That is unreasonable and unjust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 3 to the order relating to service pensions gives the Secretary of State power to backdate payment in
	<br><blockquote><p>"any particular case or class of case".</p></blockquote>
On receiving a request for backdating, therefore, he must consider whether the case falls within a class of cases in respect of which he had made a direction. If it does not, he must also consider whether he should make a direction. Lord Skelmersdale's letters to me showed that, in Mrs. Orme's case, the only question considered was whether it fell within a class of cases
	<br><blockquote><p>"where there has been error or misdirection by a Government Department or where the claimant was prevented from acting sooner by illness or other good cause"—</p></blockquote>
in other words, whether it was covered by a general rule. As the circumstances were extremely unusual, it was essential to consider whether, apart from any such rule, Mrs. Orme's claim should be backdated. The Secretary of State failed to consider that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to Lord Skelmersdale's letter of 5 October 1987, the DHSS refused Mrs. Orme's request for backdating on the grounds that
	<br><blockquote><p>"failure to associate death with service has never been regarded as good cause for delay in claiming a war widow's pension".</p></blockquote>
In his letter dated 22 February 1988, Lord Skelmers-dale went further. He claimed that the only reason for exercising discretion was
	<br><blockquote><p>"where the claimant was unable to claim earlier due to ill-health, or where he or she was misled by the Department".</p></blockquote>
That implied that no other reason would be accepted as good cause. The letter continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is in line with Social Security Commissioners' rulings … It is not accepted, for war pension or any other benefit, that lack of knowledge is good reason for not making a claim."</p></blockquote>
The reference to the commissioners' rulings and to "any other benefit" show that the intention is to interpret "good cause" in the same way as it is interpreted for the purposes of late claims for social security benefits. -It is an arbitrary and unnecessary restriction of the Secretary of State's discretion. Moreover, the interpretation placed on "good cause" is not in line with the commissioners' rulings. In my letter of 14 March 1988 to Lord Skelmersdale, I quoted from "Non-Means Tested Benefits: The Legislation", by Bonner et al:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commissioners have long recognised that there are a wide variety of circumstances in which it would be unreasonable to expect a person to make enquiries about entitlement."</p></blockquote>
In the circumstances of Mr. Orme's death, it was clearly unreasonable to expect Mrs. Orme to make such inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1000</span>
The problem is that, having decided to apply the legalistic test of "good cause", imported from social security law, the DSS refused to allow the interpretation of that test in Mrs. Orme's case to be referred to the chief adjudication officer for his advice. Lord Skelmersdale first denied that such a procedure was even possible in a letter dated 28 April 1988. After I drew attention to the similar procedure for referring "living together" cases to the CAO, Lord Skelmersdale replied, without giving any reasons, that there could be no question of extending its use to cover other cases within the war pensions scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a subsequent letter, he merely reiterated that the war adjudication officer had no jurisdiction over them. That argument was plainly irrelevant, as I had not suggested that the CAO had jurisdiction over war widows' pensions but asked for the same informal procedure to be adopted as in "living together" cases, in view of the fact that the decision on "good cause" purported to be in accordance with social security case law. The justification for not extending normal rights of appeal to war pensions is that they are supposed to be administered in a humane and sympathetic way, rather than being based on strict legal rules and case law. Where the Department chooses to depart from this approach and adopt the legal concepts of the social security system, it is only right that claimants should have an opportunity to argue their cases before an independent person or tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apologies for reading most of that case out. It was a complicated case, which has still not been satisfactorily resolved. We are talking about an old lady who has done nothing wrong and who does not have the same right of appeal as someone receiving other DSS payments. Yet it seems that the Secretary of State will not use the discretion which we believe he has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 319 proposes a somewhat different procedure. Rather than leaving it to the Secretary of State to decide whether a case should be referred to the CAO, it would be referred to an independent body. The social security appeals tribunal seems to be a more appropriate body for this purpose than the CAO, who does not normally hear appeals. It also seems appropriate that the tribunal should be able to make a binding decision on the point of law in question, possibly subject to a further appeal to the social security commissioner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has the backing of many people, certainly the consituents with whom I have dealt. Our own discussions with the Royal British Legion have shown that its members would welcome the introduction of some form of appeal to an independent tribunal in cases where the Secretary of State's decision is based on principles established under social security legislation. This is not a political argument. It is an argument about fairness and justice to elderly people who have suffered the trauma of losing their loved ones and then have not received what the Opposition believe that they should receive. We are asking that they be given the same rights to an independent inquiry, committee or tribunal so that justice is not only seen to be done but is done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is already a right of appeal on questions of entitlement to, and assessment of, war disablement pensions to a pension appeal tribunal. It would not be suitable for committees to refer any such question to the social security appeal tribunal, as the amendment suggests. War pensions are not a social security benefit in the normal way, and war pensioners have no wish to be brought into the social security system in that manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the other cases for which there are no appeal rights, such as entitlement to war pension allowances, the legislation gives the Secretary of State discretion in making decisions, having regard to the circumstances of the particular case and the policy intention. That allows the provisions to be interpreted generously although I know that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie), feels that in this case they were not. The sort of discretion made possible by this procedure would not be operable under the normal appeal procedure to the social security appeal tribunal, which is tightly bound by law and regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If responsibility for the exercise of discretion were to fall on appeal to an independent tribunal, the conditions governing the issues raised would inevitably have to be much more closely defined than at present. The provisions would undoubtedly be more restrictive and there would be a loss of flexibility. I cannot see that that would be in the interests of the war pensioner. Very often, these cases involve medical questions and considerations on which the SSAT is not in a position to adjudicate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is, dissatisfied pensioners may ask a local war pensions committee to consider their case and make recommendations on their behalf to the Secretary of State. This can be preferable to going before a tribunal. It is less formal, and pensioners can be confident of a thoroughly fair and sympathetic hearing of their case from people who are often themselves war pensioners. Over a third of the recommendations from committees result in decisions being changed in the pensioner's favour. Therefore, I do not think that the amendment is likely to improve that record and I hope that the hon. Member will not press it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not familiar with the particular case that he outlined, and it would be wrong for me to try to comment on it specifically. However, it seems to me to suggest the possibility of an appeal to the war pensions tribunal. If the procedure was through a social security appeal tribunal, it would be judged according to the regulations which that tribunal has to effect now. As the hon. Gentleman said they are more rightly drawn than the Secretary of State's discretion. He seemed to be arguing for a route of appeal, and then complained that in this case some of the inflexibility and rules which inform the social security appeal tribunal regarding late claims were being applied to this case. In so far as I could follow the general points implied by the case that the hon. Gentleman raised, his example gives added weight to my general response that there should be no change in the procedure, certainly not the one he advocates in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

on the order paper is that one judges what the argument will be and responds accordingly. I do not criticise the Minister for that. We have all found ourselves in that position but it seemed that the Minister was unable to follow the argument that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) was advancing, doubtless because he was already studying his reply. My hon. Friend was not making a case that there should be a switch, which we recognise war pensioners and their organisations would not wish to see to a more inflexible system of social security-based judgment. He argued that where social security law is imported into the judgments of war pensions appeal tribunal, the redress available when those judgments are made should be open to war pensioners, or war widows as the case may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it would not be suitable to import any social security law because it is not a social security benefit and so on. He talked about loss of flexibility. Under the present system there is no right of appeal in the cases that my hon. Friend described. When the inflexibility of social security law and case judgment is introduced into that informal system it is applied without the legal redress that would normally follow in social security law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that my hon. Friend is making a complicated point about a complicated case, and the Minister would not want to make a snap decision on it. However, he is in danger of making a snap decision as the tenor of his reply assumes that my hon. Friend is simply seeking to import a different system of judgment. That is not what my hon. Friend asked for, although it may have been what the Minister was briefed to reply on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has made a serious proposition which is supported by the Royal British Legion because it would take care of a difficulty that could arise. The Minister should give the proposition more consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seemed, from what the hon. Member for Heeley suggested, that no appeal was available. I understand that it is open to his constituent to appeal to the war pensions appeal tribunal and I shall check up on that. Alternatively, if the route were to be through the social security appeal tribunal, it would be impossible for the case to be judged other than by the same rules that the social security appeal tribunal must take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Heeley said that he found the rules particularly restrictive when my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale quoted them as a reason for not exercising the Secretary of State's discretion. I shall of course consider the case carefully because it is difficult to understand its full significance, especially as I should like to ask the hon. Member for Heeley a number of questions about it. Having considered the case, I shall see how it matches up with what is suggested in the amendment.

We should either get rid of the concept of making judgments on pensions or allow an appeal through the social security system. I cannot see why it should not be made clear.

One thing is certain about appeals, even war pensions committee appeals. The Secretary of State has no obligation to accept the judgment of that appeal by the committee. Quite often, the matter goes no further than that and there is no comeback.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both sides of the Committee accept that, as a result of the first and second world wars, there is a group of increasingly elderly widows who desperately need help as they become older. I am sure that all members of the Committee, including my hon. Friend the Minister, would wish to take all possible steps, in our increasingly affluent society, to enable those women to end their days in the financial security and dignity to which their great sacrifice entitles them. Their sacrifice has not just been a lifetime of loneliness and separation from the loved ones whom they lost in the prime of their lives while they were defending our freedom, our democracy and our way of life; we must remember that they have also made great financial sacrifice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the first world war, when the flower of Europe's young men was wiped out by a conflict of unprecedented scale and horror, the possibilities for widows remarrying was very small, even had it been socially or personally acceptable to do so. Only relatively recently has it become more common for widows
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0577">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

to remarry. We all hope that many of the young women who lost their husbands in the Falklands conflict will be able, once the scars of separation have begun to heal, to start their lives anew, should they so wish.

Today, however, there is a deserving group of women who are living their last days, usually alone, in great poverty. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider the amendment and to look again at the whole subject so that as a caring party, and as caring people, we can do something to ensure that those ladies share in the prosperity of the society for which their husbands laid down their lives.

The facts are relatively straightforward. A pre-1973 war widow receives less than half—in some cases much less than half—the pension received by a post-1973 war widow, and I hope that the Committee will bear with me if I outline briefly the reasons for that. Before 1973, the widows of service men whose deaths were attributable to service were entitled to either a service pension paid by the Ministry of Defence or a war pension paid by the Department of Social Security, whichever was the better. So most first and second world war widows receive only the war widows' pension. The rate varies according to the rank of the deceased husband, which seems an anomaly in itself because the sacrifice is the same for all, regardless of rank. The current rate for a private's widow is £53.10 a week. An additional £5.75 is paid to all widows on attaining the age of 65, increasing to £11.50 at the age of 70 and £14.65 at the age of 80. That means that the widow of a private killed before 1973 and aged between 65 and 70 would receive a total of £58.85 a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Burns
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that £53.50 a week is 30 per cent higher than what a national insurance widow receives from the state?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since April 1973, the Ministry of Defence has awarded service widows' pensions on top of the DSS war widows' pension in cases where the death is attributable to service. The amount of the service widows' pension again varies according to rank. It is 90 per cent of the pension that the service man would have received had he served to the end of a full career, with an adjustment to take account of the fact that DSS war widows' pensions are higher than ordinary national insurance widows' pensions. I am advised by the Ministry that the annual rate for a private would now be some £3,312 per annum, or £63,69 a week. A post-1973 war widow would receive that sum on top of the £58.85 received by the pre-1973 war widow. That means that the widow of a private killed after 1973 and aged between, say 65 and 70, will receive £122.54 a week—more than twice as much as the pre-1973 widow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nobody here would begrudge the sum paid to the widows of our service men who have been killed since 1973 or who may yet be killed on active service in the interests of the country. It is clear that something must be done to increase the assistance given to the pre-1973 widows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove that anomaly and
	<span class='label label-info column'>1006</span>
extend to all war widows the benefits of the improvements made to the armed forces family pension scheme in 1973.1 know that there will be those who will say that we cannot afford to remove at one go such an anomaly, and that we should refrain from doing so because it would set precedents for other groups that are similarly seeking improvements in their pension entitlement. However, I can answer directly those two criticisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few years ago, the Government estimated that to remove the time bar would cost some £200 million a year. I shall not dispute that figure because it is impossible to do so on the information available. We simply cannot be precisely certain how many of those very elderly war widows are still alive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that, if passed, the amendment would cost £200 million to implement. If we accepted his proposal, to be logical we would not also have to deal with invalidity payments, which would add another £400 million to the cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not follow. I am coming to precedent. In my opinion there is no precedent. We are not setting an example for others to follow because we are talking about a unique case that should not and cannot be used as a precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot be precisely certain how many of the very elderly war widows are still alive and what their pension entitlement would be under the new scheme. Estimates place the number of war widows from the first and second world wars at between 55,000 and 63,000, so I shall talk in terms of around 60,000 which is as near to accurate as I can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is even more important to remember that the commitment in financial terms would not be open ended, as most improvements to our welfare system are. Far from it. The commitment would be very limited, for the very simple reason that those widows are dying; every year their number becomes smaller. It would be the only category of Government expenditure that automatically decreased each year and had a finite time scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give some concrete examples to put that fact into perspective. A lady who was 20 years old in the last days of the first world war would now be 81 years old, so most first world war widows will be in their late 80s or early 90s. A Lady who was 20 years old in the last days of the second world war would now be 64, so most second world war widows will be 70 years of age. We are talking about some of the frailest and most vulnerable members of our society. It is estimated that some 3,000 pre-1973 war widows die each year but for obvious reasons that rate of death will inevitably increase as the years pass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the financial aspect. I shall now discuss briefly the second point—precedent. There is no other group of widows who are so deserving as the elderly ladies whom we are discussing. It is, perhaps, a mark of the respect and concern that we all feel for them that the amendment and new clause are supported by hon. Members from all parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I quote from a few of the letters that I have recently received. I deliberately
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1007</span>
quote from them because the subject is, to some extent, emotional. There is no need to apologise for that; we are discussing people's lives and the sacrifices that they have made. Some of the writing is, for obvious reasons, a little difficult to read; the letters are written by very elderly ladies. The first one is from a lady in Manchester. She writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am a War Widow. I nursed my husband for over 20 years as he was confined to a wheelchair and had to be dressed and bathed. He died in 1978. My youngest son who was 19 was killed 3 years before so shock of that did not help … I have applied to various organisations for help in the past but was made to feel I was begging, so I just struggle and"—</p></blockquote>
again, the grammar is not quite accurate, but hon. Members will appreciate that the letters are from very elderly ladies—
	<br><blockquote><p>"as do a lot of other war widows like myself. I don't want luxuries just enough to live like normal people and be able to buy bit of meat… now and again.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I am sorry this letter is so long and it took me a long time to write it. Half my life was taken away when my husband died and I miss him so much."</p></blockquote>
A letter from a lady in Worsley, Lancashire reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I did not know there was a difference in the price of a life given with pride for our country. My husband was in the desert for 3 yrs in the armoured division he was sent to France later where he was killed. The widowers from the Falklands war deserve all"—</p></blockquote>
all anybody can give them—
	<br><blockquote><p>"nobody can replace these men. My 3 children still miss their father and tell their children how proud they are of him and their Great Grandfather who has no grave killed in 1916 but this has left me and them very bitter."</p></blockquote>
Another letter from a lady in Cramlington in Northumberland, near my own constituency of Hexham, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I speak as a War Widows daughter my Dad was killed in Burma in March 1944,1 was two months old, my Mam is now 72 years old and has struggled along since then, so therefore time is running out, they haven't had money to save for old age, so it would be lovely to receive a good pension in their last few years. My Mam was one of the lucky few who was successful in her application to the Government and British Legion to be able to travel to the Far East to visit her husbands grave, 40 years on."</p></blockquote>
A lady from Bognor Regis wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I feel as if we have been penalised for too long and have always thought my husband died in vain. He was in the Irish Guards, and was killed in 1944. He was called up at the beginning of the war, being on the reserves. I couldnt even afford a pram for my little son, had no money for baby clothes until kind people gave me there cast-offs. I did not receive one penny when he was killed … I still have this letter way back in 1944 saying what a brave man he was, he done his job and done it well, but Im still asking myself why did he die, where is this land fit for heroes to live in… In 19871 was able to visit my husbands grave in Italy for the first time for 43 years."</p></blockquote>
Penultimately, there is a letter from a lady in Basildon who says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My husband was a regular from 1936-1945 and served with the Grenadier Guards. We was discharged due to ill health as he was a P.O. W. in Germany for 5 years. He came home a wreck and suffered all our married life and he passed away 26th January 1974, suffering from severe emphysema. I saw him fighting to breath but I was lucky; at least he came home and we had some years together not like many friends I know whose husbands were killed in the early war years."</p></blockquote>
Finally, I have a letter from a lady in Pitsea, Essex, who says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The point is wouldn't it be nice to finish our last few years with a bit of comfort. After all there can't be many of us left, so why the discrimation between war widows."</p></blockquote>
There are many other letters and some are very
	<span class='label label-info column'>1008</span>
moving. I wanted to bring to the Committee's attention just a cross-section of those that I have received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The widows' tales are moving; there are traces of bitterness in them. But that is understandable in people who sacrificed virtually everything that they had in exchange for struggle, loss and hardship. Can we not provide them with security and happiness towards the end of their lives?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments about precedent and retrospective measures are bogus. I do not accept that what is proposed for first and second world war widows would set a precedent. What can compare to the horrors of those events, how can we possibly do anything other than retrospectively? The very existence of an injustice means that something wrong happened in the past. The righting of a wrong is, by definition, retrospective. To say that this is a retrospective measure is a stupid non-argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) for his intervention. That is exactly the point. I have already talked about precedent and the group of people who would be affected. I cannot accept, and I do not think that any hon. Member honestly believes, that there is any comparison between a war widow who lost her husband when he fought so that we could all be here today and someone who was injured in the war. We must get away from such a bogus argument. We are not asking for retrospective payments. We merely ask for any benefit that can be given by the Government at any stage to be paid as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

We are talking about approximately £200 million. I am the first to admit that that is a lot of money, but the numbers will rapidly diminish. Even if that sum is not available—as I accept might be the case—why should we not move towards that objective? In a recent parliamentary question my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1009</span>
State for Social Security was asked to estimate the annual cost of making an ex gratia weekly payment of £10, £20, £30, £40 and £50 to pre-1973 war widows and what that cost would be at current values in each of the next 10 years, assuming an annual increase of 10 per cent in the current annual death rate of those widows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are illuminating. If the Government made a £10 ex gratia weekly payment this year it would cost £28 million. In 1999 it would cost £16 million. If the ex gratia payment was £20 a week, it would cost £57 million this year and dwindle to £32 million in 10 years' time. An ex gratia payment of £30 a week would cost £85 million, dropping to £48 million in 10 years' time. An ex gratia payment of £40 a week would cost £113 million this year and £63 million in 10 years' time. An ex gratia payment of £50 a week would cost £141 million this year, falling to £79 million in 1999. It does not take much of a mathematician to see clearly that within 10 years those amounts would be halved and that the rate of decrease would increase as more widows die.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not pursuing this matter because I have a vested interest in it. I thank God that my father came home safe and sound from Dunkirk and Burma. I am pursuing it because I think that a deep injustice is involved, for which there is no logic and no excuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not believe that a nation as wealthy as ours is becoming is unable to do something for these ladies. They gave everything that they had and we should give them something in return. This is a personal matter. Some of my co-signatories may disagree, but for me the cause has been given added poignancy by Prince Philip's attendance at the funeral of that evil war criminal Hirohito. As Head of State of Japan during the second world war, he was directly responsible for the murder and torture of many men who left the war widows on whose behalf we are battling.

I am asking first for acceptance that a genuine anomaly exists and, secondly, for a move towards righting that anomaly. I am a realistic, if not cynical, politician

and I know that there cannot be any immediate or dramatic action, if only for practical reasons. However, the strength of all-party feeling on the matter is not of my making. It will not go away and, indeed seems to grow stronger year by year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will give a firm assurance that he will continue to press his colleagues in other Departments to deal sympathatically with this anomaly, as he has already done in a genuine and committed way.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment and the new clause, and I wish simply to underline a few of the points that the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) made. However well I marshall my brief, I shall not do as well as those war widows, parts of whose letters were read out to us today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham said that this was a test as to whether the Conservative party was caring, although that is not the objective that I set for this debate. We all know that, when it comes to the crunch, it is the votes that count and not the words that we use to express our commitments. I am pleased to see that the light is on, showing that part of the debate will be broadcast. Many constituents of members on both sides of the Committee will not only be listening to our debate but will also want to know whether we think that their case is important enough to vote for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was most careful in my preparation for today's debate. I find it difficult to speak and therefore spend a lot of time in preparation. I was going to confess that my brief was provided by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and say that his finger prints would be all over it but, having read today's newspaper, I should say that his foot prints are all over it. From the description that some Conservative Members gave of the hon. Member for Macclesfield, I did not recognise the person who has chaired our Committee and who is a colleague on the Select Committee on Social Services. He is modest, retiring, and so bashful that he is not even in the Public Gallery today. He quite rightly wished to step down from chairing this Committee because he knows that he is biased in this matter. He is wiser than those who think that they can be unbiased, and knows that we are all partly governed by our beliefs and prejudices. It is a sign of wisdom when one can recognise one's bias and bring it into the open. Keynes said that those who think that they are unbiased are usually those caught by the rantings of a madman who, long ago, was carted off into the night and found insane.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fearful of what Government Whips may do to those who oppose them, I am not sure how carefully I should attend to my brief. However, I take heart because one
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1011</span>
of the letters written in 1975 was from the person who is now the Prime Minister. I have another letter from the Prime Minister soon after she became leader of the Tory party. Naturally, it shows a feeling of patriotism and a commitment to those who fought for the country, although those feelings are equally strong among Opposition Members. I shall read into the record the guts of those letters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first letter, which was signed by somebody in the then Leader of the Opposition's private office, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"She is very conscious of the difficult position that so many widows find themselves in.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Specifically relating to war widows, we promised in our October 1974 Manifesto that we would remove the distinction concerning whether or not the husband had been in service before or fter 31st March 1973."</p></blockquote>
We know the fate of people who write letters from the Leader of the Opposition's office. Such a letter was written during the 1979 general election, telling someone how lucky he was to live in a council house. That person was elected to Parliament and went on to dizzier heights as presenter of London Weekend Television. He now reports from the Parliamentary Press Gallery. There can be no greater distinction than that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Birkenhead will now quote the actual passage from the October 1974 manifesto. I presume that he has done his homework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I shall not quote that. I would be surprised if any Conservative Member suggested that a letter from the then Leader of the Opposition, who is now the Prime Minister, could be misleading. I presented the record as it was presented to me; I did not check up and try to show that the Prime Minister's staff misled a war widow to win votes before an election. I accepted that the word of the Prime Minister and those in her office is as good as can be. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson), whose name is on the Amendment Paper with mine, will undoubtedly quote from that passage to cast doubt on letters that come from the Prime Minister's office. Tory Back Bench Members may want to do that, but I shall take no part in trying to cast aspersions against the Prime Minister, when she was Leader of the Opposition or now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being more than usually perverse. Was not an error made in the Leader of the Opposition's office? There is no such reference in the October 1974 manifesto.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a revelation to me. The second letter on this matter, dated 5 January 1983, is from the Prime Minister herself. She did not think it necessary to say that a member of her staff had written a letter containing a terrible factual error, but said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if is our wish to establish as rapidly as economic circumstances permit, a scheme whereby the widows of all servicemen killed in action … would receive a pension similar to that now awarded to widows of servicemen currently in the Armed Forces."</p></blockquote>
It may be a good debating point, or perhaps I should have studied the foot prints on my brief more carefully,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1012</span>
but I thought that I did not need to check the first letter because it is backed up by a second letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I conclude, I make a plea to Conservative Members. This debate has come alive. My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has led us in this battle day in, day out, over the weeks. I am sure that Ministers will agree that she has won most of the arguments, even though we have not won most of the votes. For most of the time, Conservative Members have been busily going about their business, as some of us have been doing, in an attempt to keep up with our work. Now, for this strange reason, the debate has come alive. I dare say, as the Whips were so careful in briefing the press, that they have also been careful in briefing Conservative Members. The contrast between the clear-cut interventions made in the speech of the hon. Member for Hexham in an attempt to trip him up and the difficulty the hon. Gentleman had in reading some of the writing of very old people was almost enough to have made me vote for television so that it could be seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Whips will have done their rounds. Whichever party is in power, we should not kid ourselves that the system is ever any different. They will have assured Conservative Members that the Government have a good case, giving the bogus distinction between widows who lost their husbands in the war and people who, thank God, returned from the war but were wounded, and talking about equity between the two groups. Other Conservative Members will no doubt have been told about the Prime Minister's wish to promote at some stage. The hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fallon), who is the "Conservative Whip, is shaking his head. I am not sure that those who run the Whips Office will be too pleased if it is felt that the full panoply of terror has not been employed, but if the hon. Gentleman wishes to suggest that the job has not been done well, be it on his head, not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know how pressure is applied to Government Members. Yet there are times in the life of a Parliament when Back Benchers have the chance to inflict damage on the Government—that is from the Opposition's point of view—or, from the Government point of view, to get something on the statute book. Back Benchers do not often have the chance to do that. It happened under the previous Labour Government with the Lawson-Roker-Wise amendment. That Government warned us of the horrors that would result if the amendment were passed. They said that all sorts of floodgates would be opened. We were told exactly the same when there was the leak on child benefits. As we can see from the Labour manifesto of 1979, the two greatest and proudest achievements of that Government were the indexing of personal allowances and the introduction of child benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Back Benchers should be assured that if they have the courage not just to talk about the Conservative party being a caring party, but to vote to make sure that it is, and the amendment is not challenged on the Floor of the House, the next Tory election manifesto will proudly show the justice that has been brought to war widows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1013</span>
There is more than that. There is also the question of what we are here for. Much of the time we are fighting a continual election battle. Occasionally Back Benchers can, as the hon. Member of Hexham said, do something that will affect not just the hon. Gentleman's constituents, but some of my constituents and some of the constituents of every other Member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we think about whether to defy the Whips, it is worth recalling an incident in Zeffirelli's film that is not recorded in the life of Thomas More. In the trial that takes place in the great hall here, Rich has perjured himself for promotion. They did not have Whips in those days—Ministers did the job much more directly. More picks the seal of office from Rich and says, "What is this?". Rich says very proudly, puffing out his chest, that he is chancellor for Wales. In the film, More lets the medallion fall and says something like, "Rich, to lose one's soul for the world—but for Wales." Government Back Benchers must decide whether it is worth losing their souls just to be in with the Whips or whether they will make a real change in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham, gave five powerful reasons for accepting the amendment. The most powerful was simply that we owe it to this group of people. Our debate might not be taking place in a free House of Commons if people had not voluntarily fought in the first and second world wars and died for their country. This is not about a caring party, but about our duties and responsibilities to people who made that great and final sacrifice. Many things can be recouped, but we cannot give back, people who have died for their country, their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The awful thing about the letters that the hon. Member for Hexham read out was the bitterness in them, which did not stem from what normally would be pride in husbands who died for their country, That bitterness is felt towards a country that has been mean to those who have made that sacrifice. Whether we vote on the matter and whether we win the vote if we do, those voices will echo with us tonight and ask whether we did justice by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second point was that we are targeting on one of the poorest groups. Targeting is one of the things that the Government love to do. We cannot use a hosepipe for distributing benefits, but the targeting argument appeals to them. The hon. Gentleman said that the amendment was targeted at people who are, in some cases, very old—hence the handwriting. We know from other Government surveys that the oldest pensioners are the very poorest pensioners. We are talking not just about war widows, but about people who would be desperately poor anyway because they are very old and not knitted into any occupational pension scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman mentioned the sum of £200 million. The hon. Member for Hendon, South [Mr. Marshall) said that if there was a knock-on effect, the sum might be £400 million. The hon. Member for Hexham tried to draw a line there, and I support him for drawing that line, which we shall have to defend if the amendment is accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us put that amount against the Budget surplus.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1014</span>
The Government dare not open the Treasury doors for fear of the money falling out on to the streets. We have never lived in a time when there has been such a Budget surplus. The Government do not have the fig leaf of being able to say that they wanted this measure, but the money was not available. However old pensioners are, and however difficult they find it to write those letters, they hear about the Budget surplus, day after day, on radio, television and in the newspapers. The Chancellor has an embarrassment of riches. We are talking about using £200 million from a possible Budget surplus of £50 billion. We are asking for the petty cash of the Government Budget surplus to give justice to war widows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham gave a fourth reason for supporting the amendment. We know that when we go back to our constituences, we shall not be able to defend the position as it is. If we cannot face the widows, eyeball to eyeball, and say that they should not have a pension increase, we should have the courage to say that we cannot defend the position to one another, and press the amendment to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point made by the hon. Member for Hexham was a neat distinction. He said that we are appealing not for retrospective payments but for retrospective justice. That is why I support the amendment that is tabled in the name of the hon. Member for Hexham and, I am pleased to see, other Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Without questioning your judgment in selecting the amendments, Sir Paul, I wonder whether the matter is being debated in the right Commitee. As I understand it, the question of war widows is a matter for the Ministry of Defence rather than the Department of Social Security. It might be difficult to ask a Committee considering a Social Security Bill to deal with the matter—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Dunnachie) says that that is nonsense, but that is not the view of the Ministry of Defence. He may laugh in that way because of the little white light above the door, but I remind him that the Ministry of Defence has administered was pensions from time immemorial so there is no point in laughing. Many people believe that it is a matter for the Ministry of Defence rather than for the Department of Social Security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is always difficult to discuss pensions, particularly in emotive situations. All I want to do in what I hope will be a relatively brief speech is simply to point to some of the things that the Government are doing about widows' pensions. We must keep the matter in perspective. At present, war widows receive more money than widows on national insurance pensions.

As I said earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos), national insurance pensioners receive 30 per cent, less than war widows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into that, but before there are howls of synthetic laughter from the Opposition I will say that when the Government made some of their changes to the social security system last April they introduced transitional payments to help the less well off. On top of that, they increased the state pension last October; the increase will take effect in April. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security is introducing a special pension next October for the least well off pensioners in order to target resources and help the least well off. It is too easy to try to score cheap political points. There should be occasions when even Opposition Members have the decency to give some credit to the Government for what they are doing to raise living standards and improve the pensions of the less well off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I want to develop my remarks further and to return to my original point that we must bear in mind the fact that at present war widows receive pensions that are 30 per cent higher than those received by national insurance state pensioners. Furthermore, an additional age allowance is paid to war widows. War widows' pensions and allowances—unlike national insurance and post-1973 service widows' pensions—are tax free, which is a help and a bonus to war widows. War widows' pensions are not income related. That, too, should not be forgotten. A war widow may have other income, such as earnings or an occupational pension. She may be—as in the case of post-1973 service widows, or the widows of war pensioners who were teachers or civil servants—an occupational pensions widow. We must look at the whole story before focusing on a small group, without taking into consideration all the additional factors. I know that it may be difficult for some Opposition Members to do that, but it is only fair to bear that point in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

In addition, improvements were made to the armed forces occupational pension scheme in 1973. The widows of those who served in the armed forces after April 1973 and whose death was due to service are entitled, regardless of the length of the husband's service, to an armed forces attributable widows' pension. That is paid in addition to the war widows pension under the war pensions scheme. The improvements to the scheme were not made retrospective; that would have been contrary to the principle of non-retrospection which is applied to all occupational pension schemes. I believe that to break that principle now in the case of service widows would have wide-ranging and costly implications for the armed forces scheme and for other public service pension schemes. As my
	<span class='label label-info column'>1016</span>
hon. Friend the Member for Hexham said, it could cost an estimated £200 million to £600 million a year to make all the improvements to the 1973 armed forces scheme retrospective for war widows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the numbers of pre-1973 and post-1973 widows, war widows who benefit from the 1973 improvements to the armed forces occupational pension scheme form a relatively small proportion—some 2 per cent—of the total number of war widows. There are over 57,000 war widows in the war pensions scheme administered by the Department of Social Security. Only 1,200 of them benefit from the 1973 improvements to the armed forces pension scheme. Although there is a disparity in the level of provision for pre-1973 and post-1973 war widows, only a very small proportion benefit from those improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be harsh on war widows because—
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson) says that there are some in Chelmsford; there may well be. I come from a military family. My father spent the whole of his working life in the armed forces, as did my grandfather. We lived in military establishments; many of our friends were members of the armed forces. Everybody in this Room understands the horror of war and the tragedy of members of the armed forces who are killed in action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Governments, Labour Governments, or Governments of any political complexion want to help war widows. They want to help other widows, too. When we bear in mind the fact that war widows are receiving one third more help than state widows, we have to think hard and rationally and not be too over come by the genuine emotions that such cases cause. We must ask, "Are we doing enough across the board; are there other groups of pensioners who need money targeted on them?" The answer is, yes. The least well- off pensioners in society need to be helped. I am proud of the fact that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has identified that group of pensioners and is introducing a scheme later this year that will provide badly-needed additional resources for them. I shall consider carefully before I vote tonight. I stand by what I said and I think that however well-meaning—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support amendment No. 295 and new clause 2, for which the arguments have been put ably. I shall bring the debate back to the war widows themselves, most of them world war 2 widows with a few remaining from world war 1. We are talking about that specfic group of people, whose grievances we are trying to redress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These women's husbands either volunteered or were called up to defend our way of life, our freedom and our beliefs. It has been said today that we are able to stand here and debate this issue, and some Conservative Members may be able to oppose their Government's wishes, is as a result of the very deaths that we are discussing. We owe these men a debt of gratitude and remembrance. There is nothing that we can do for them directly but we can honour the debt that we owe to their families. We are talking about justice and about redressing a grievance. We are talking about righting a wrong that has been allowed to continue for all too long. It is nothing short of a disgrace that more than 40 years after these deaths took place, we are still debating whether to do the right thing. It is nothing short of tragic that whatever we do will be too late for many women who have already died after hard lives, bringing up their children unsupported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also tragic that what we can do for the surviving widows comes at the very end of their lives, when some of them have already spent many years of unwarranted misery. They have not only lived lonely lives but have done so without the financial support of their partner. It has been stated that women widowed in large scale
	<span class='label label-info column'>1018</span>
wars always find it more difficult to find new partners and to remarry even if they wish to do so. Not to put too fine a point on it, there were not enough men to go round. Many of these women were forced to live solitary lives, often with young families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that in the majority of cases, we are talking about women who were brought up with a different attitude towards their way of life and role in life than that of many of us who are bringing up daughters today. These women were brought up to be family women. They were brought up to expect to stay at home and look after their children and to be supported by a husband. They were not educated to have a career as well as to be a mother. They were not educated to expect to take their place in the work force for most of their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember as a teenager in Nottingham being amused by my mother telling me how she had to leave the Players cigarette factory when she got married. Married women were not allowed to work in that factory. The war changed all that. Afterwards, the rules were changed a little and married women could work, but not once they had children. It was not the women who made these decisions, it was society and the industries of the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was the climate in which these women were living. Imagine the indignity that many of them felt in having to go out to work to try to support their growing families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will know that because women were needed to work in the munitions factories and so on during the second world war, nurseries suddenly appeared all over the country. This country had universal childcare provision then. At the end of the war, it was all closed down again. That says something about the possibility of creating child care if there is the will to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) for that intervention. That was very much the case. The women I am talking about did not have the facilities that were available during the war years. Many of the letters that I have received point to the nightmare experience of these war widows during the school holidays or when their children were sick. They had to try to hold down jobs when the odds were set against them and their wages were not high enough to pay for proper child care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about redressing a long-standing grievance. The figure of £200 million, generally agreed upon as the maximum involved to put this matter right, is a small amount in the context of the money currently available to the Government to repay a huge, longstanding debt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the hon. Lady with great interest. As one who also lost members of his family, not in the second world war but in the first world war, I accept that times have changed a great deal since then, especially for working women. The hon. Lady will acknowledge that there were other widows at that time who had not been married to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1019</span>
service men and they are now paid 30 per cent less than women who were widowed through the war. How much more should be paid to the widows of husbands who died on active service than to those whose husbands died through the actions of drunk drivers, while crossing roads, at work or by having heart attacks while young? This is a difficult problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady talked about justice, but is it not possible that if we give war widows more, other widows will have feelings of injustice because they may have suffered as much and had an equal struggle to bring up their families? Their husbands died in other circumstances but it is possible that they were almost as tragic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to mention details relating to the widows of civilians, but I hope that the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) will allow me to defer my comments until later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not intend to target one group of women against their rivals in the competition for rare resources. We are discussing the plight of people who suffered for many years because their husbands died while serving their country. I agree that widowhood is hard however it happens, and I accept that many women who were widowed at the same time as war widows may have suffered just as severely. However, some financial considerations have not been mentioned by Conservative Members in this debate and I shall refer to them later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to redress a particular grievance of women whose husbands died while serving their country in the great war, most of whom had been called up while quite young and should not be distracted from the fact that we are discussing that group. Many of us feel strongly that other groups of people should be reassessed because they are poorly treated. However, this is not the time to say that we can do nothing for them because other categories of people receive less than they should be paid to allow them to live in comfort and dignity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what happened to those widows in the years immediately following the war when the pension was a mere £1 a week and that measly sum was taxed as unearned income if they went to work. The level of that pension ensured that almost all the women in that category had to work, and compared with the 7/6d in child allowance at that time it was too poor an income to permit widows to make the necessary vital provision for their old age. They could neither save nor pay for separate pensions and tended to work in low-paid jobs where provision for pensions was non-existent. As a result of having to work hard and having no surplus income, those women were unable to make provision for their old age as they might have done had their husbands lived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must take account of what happened to the widows when they reached the age of 40. The majority were widowed in their early 20s and their pensions remained at £1 a week until they were 40. Even with an increase in the pension after that age, the amounts received were pitifully small and did nothing to relieve the misery in which the women existed. Once their children left home, the small additions were with-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1020</span>
drawn. The correspondence from those women shows that salt was rubbed in their wounds by the discovery that German widows fared so much better. On average, they received three times the amount of the pension paid to British war widows, were given a free holiday once every two years and had complete security of housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The widows of service men killed after 31 March 1973 have been awarded not only war widow's pension but an additional occupational pension from the Ministry of Defence. Women widowed since 1973 receive a total pension that is approximately double that received by women widowed before 1973. That is perceived as an insult to those men who died in defence of this country during the great wars. A disparity is a disparity, regardless of the numbers on either side of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The women concerned feel very bitter about that, and told me of a letter dated 30 April 1985 from one of the Prime Minister's private secretaries. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As you know, the pensions awarded under the War Pension Scheme are the same irrespective of the date of service. The additional pensions which war widows of today can obtain are occupational pensions paid for by the Ministry of Defence as the serviceman's employer. The cost of making such benefits retrospective would be enormous and the government has tried always to make it clear that this was not therefore an option."</p></blockquote>
As one war widow stated in a letter to me,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Who does Mrs. Thatcher think employed our men during the war?"</p></blockquote>
Later servicemen may have contributed to the Ministry of Defence financially, but their men paid with their lives. The letter from the Prime Minister's office referred to the enormous cost, but is £200 million an enormous cost in the light of the injustice done?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several Conservative Members spoke about the comparison with civilian widows. The Government said that war widows receive a substantially higher pension than civilian widows, but war widows are precluded from receiving any supplementary benefit. There seems to be more design than accident in the setting of the figure. Civilian widows with only a state pension may receive housing benefit, and rate and water rate rebates, but war widows have had to pay those in full from their meagre pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ironically, in the past war widows were denied places on housing lists because they have no husbands. That would be the case in very few councils today, but women on their own after the war were treated differently. Women's rights have ensured that women are treated as equal members of society to a greater extent than in the late 1940s and the 1950s. We must not forget how far matters have moved, and that women today are bringing up young families in a different climate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also been told that civilian widows receive benefits such as free medical prescriptions, spectacles, dental treatment and so on, but war widows do not receive similar concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to state clearly that war widows who were widowed before 1973 do not begrudge war widows of post-1973 or civilian widows their higher pensions. They are anxious to emphasise that. They simply want justice and fair play and it is difficult to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1021</span>
explain to them why there is financial discrimination. Not until the 1970s did those war widows form themselves into a campaigning group. For almost 30 years, they struggled on alone, often being rebuffed and accused of being unpatriotic when they put their cases individually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1976, in response to much campaigning and hard work, the Labour Government released half the war widows pension from taxation. The next Conservative Government released the remaining half. But that small concession accomplished little for many war widows. It did nothing to help the poorest who had only their pensions, because those were already too small to be taxed. It did precious little for those whose incomes were at the lowest levels liable to taxation. Furthermore, the remaining distinction—whether the husband had been killed in service before or after 31 March 1973—caused great dissatisfaction and unhappiness.

and is dated 13 October 1975. It is signed by a Mrs. Susanna Burr, of the private office of the Leader of the Opposition, as the Prime Minister then was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourteen years later, when the right hon. Lady has been Prime Minister for 10 years, that promise has still not been honoured. Many of the women concerned still receive only the basic war widows pension of just over £53 a week. Ironically, that takes them just beyond the reach of social security payments. The pension rises to about £59 a week when the widow reaches 65. A woman widowed after 1973 receives about £123 a week, comprising the war widows pension and the Ministry of Defence pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last April war widows suffered a further blow when some of the concessions offered by more generous councils were withdrawn. Many lost more than the £2.50 specified as the maximum loss from housing benefit cuts. For people on a low income of £2.50 or more per week is a lot of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those war widows have suffered enough. Whatever
	<span class='label label-info column'>1022</span>
we do now cannot make up for their suffering over the decades since the deaths of their husbands. Only a few of them are still alive and their numbers are reduced every year. It is time for the Government to honour that promise made 14 years ago and to remove the distinction between service widows whose husbands died before and after 1973. The injustice has already been perpetrated. No other country treats its widows with such disregard. The treatment of war widows is not only a national disgrace but an insult to the men who gave their lives so valiantly. The Government should remove the disctinction and allow the widows of its service men to receive the same pensions and benefits regardless of when their husbands died in the active service of their country. We owe it both to the widows and to the men who died to redress this genuine grievance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Whatever Opposition Members say, there are genuine difficulties in identifying the responsibility for attending to the anomalies that we are drawing to the Committee's attention. There is no doubt about the difficulty of the role of the Ministry of Defence, and I am not sure whether the Department of Social Security can deliver the goods, even if it wishes to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we have raised those issues and have not tried to shovel them under the carpet or forget them. The Government will be unable to avoid discussing them. If we look into history, there is no doubt that other Governments have ignored those matters completely. The emphasis of Government policies is, rightly, concentrating more on individual needs rather than on those that are categorised. Categorisation, albeit of needy causes, is a difficult concept and leads to misunderstandings so that other groups of people feel ignored and forgotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, there is pressure in the country for us to recognise this diminishing group. Those widows and their husbands have contributed to the freedoms that we now enjoy and the strength of our economy, from which all benefits are funded, so we should recognise that. How we react is important, not only to the small number involved, but to those who espouse the cause of that group. We should perhaps consider an exception to our general policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the years the Ministry of Defence has carried out regular reviews of such matters and groups who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1023</span>
might benefit from enhancement of pensions and general pensions. My right hon. Friend may feel that that is a matter to be considered. Sadly, the Government do not seem to have been prompted sufficiently to do so recently, but perhaps now is the time to do it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter has caused anxiety for many year. There have been few debates in the House on the subject. When the rules were changed in favour of post-1973 widows, it might have been better if we had extended the provisions to cover this group, too. That would have been sensible, but it was 15 years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many years from 1974, nothing much was done, by the Labour party. The problem of comparing the records of the Labour and Conservative parties is great. Although we have not achieved the result that we should like, the Labour party neither tried for nor could it have achieved that, because it was responsible for the economic conditions that were especially cruel to widows and their standards of living. Many of them who managed to invest money had the value of their savings completely eroded during that time. Their financial status was set back substantially. I am not making an excuse, but as a result of our economic and social achievements, we have at the least minimised the pressures on war pensioners, even though the central issue has not been resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are a good opportunity to air the subject again. It is important to consider whether anything can be offered to war pensioners either through our present proceedings, or through other Government sources. We owe it to widows to keep the subject open and debate it further, until we can discharge our obligation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friend the Minister has taken careful note of what has been said so far in the debate, and that he will continue to do so. I am sure that he sympathises with the proposals. I look forward to hearing his ideas. Having aired the subject so well, I hope that the Committee's actions will not prejudice the possibility of improving the position of widows. There may be better opportunities to pursue the matter on Report. Memories fade, but much is owed to those who fought in the war. Somehow, we must ensure that the price paid by their widows and families is not too high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood (Roxburgh and Berwicksire)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. I genuinely congratulate the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) on the way in which he advance his argument. Discussing such issues can cause difficulties as emotion can so easily run away with us all. That is understandable, but it does not properly serve the way in which we should deliberate such legislation. The hon. Gentleman presented his case well, for which I give him credit. He must be under some pressure from other Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirk-hope) criticised us, in a pained way, for making cheap party political points. If either of the speeches of the hon. Members for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and for Greenwich (Mrs. Barnes) fall into that category, the hon. Gentleman has a strange definition of party political points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: He may have been thinking of that hon. Gentleman's hard-line speech. If so, that is no excuse for his using pained expressions about earlier contributions to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is absolutely fatuous and disingenuous of the hon. Member for Chelmsford to say that this is the wrong place and wrong time to discuss war pensioners. That is a spurious argument. I understand that, during the entire century, only two Acts of Parliament concerning war pensions have been passed—one in 1921 and one in 1973. Therefore, according to the hon. Member for Chelmsford, there should be 50-year intervals between the times when such legislation is discussed. We debate Social Security Bills annually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be right technically to tag on such an amendment to the next war pensions legislation. If the Minister assures us that he will speak to the Government business managers or table such an amendment on Report, I shall be happy to adjourn the debate until then, if that will make it easier for Conservative Members to vote. However, that is a spurious and disingenuous argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may like to recall that the hon. Member for Chelmsford, after making his party political speech, said that he intended to listen to the debate and might be swayed by it. Perhaps he has better hearing than most of us, because to listen to the debate one must be in the Room. Will the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fallon) tell us where he has put the hon. Member for Chelmsford? 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh, here he is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Timing is everything, Sir Paul!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not consider myself to be in a good position on this Committee to criticise people for not coming. 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> At least I am open enough to admit it. Apart from all these peripheral arguments, the real question is whether war widows have a deserving case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there are subsidiary arguments that engage the party political argument about whether pledges were or were not made. Members of Parliament—especially new ones, such as the hon. Member for Hexham—are perfectly entitled to make up their minds about relative priorities and the Prime Minister is entitled to her view as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Hexham, I am not a particularly long-serving Member of Parliament. In my constituency work—I am sure that this applies to other hon. Members—the most difficult cases to cope with, by a long chalk, are those of impoverished war widows. Quite rightly, they are bitter about the treatment that they feel that they have received from their country. The hon. Member for Chelmsford's argument could be paraphrased along the lines of, "Well, of course there are other people worse off." I dispute that, because of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1025</span>
the combination of the emotional loss and the difficulties that accrue directly from losing a husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chelmsford says that he has family experience. He has that over me, because I have no direct experience, but I know that widows who have lost their husbands as serving soldiers have suffered financially as a result—some very substantially. He read his brief very well, but the hon. Member for Greenwich demolished the substantive part of his economic argument when she said, quite rightly, that the additional 30 per cent, over and above the normal widow's pension takes them straight out of income support and the tax bracket as well. The hon. Gentleman referred to the achievements in social security which have been made. If he wants me to acknowledge that some improvements have been made over the past 10 years, I will happily do so, but he cannot argue that in terms of war widows. The argument does not stand up at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question before the Committee is whether there are more deserving cases. Are there people who deserve more, in terms of deciding what extra cash must be spent, than war widows? I have confronted that question and examined the matter in detail. I know the figures and have studied them, because we have all had the constituency cases that force us to do so. I have not come across a more deserving group, and I will defend that argument against anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is perfectly reasonable for Governments to say that the cost of making desirable improvements must be considered. Even in the middle 1970s they may have been right to say that cost was a factor, when considering the commitments being made in that area. The cost argument, as has been said by the hon. Member for Birkenhead and others, is now much weaker than it was. The hon. Member for Hexham explained why—it is a diminishing cost and the Treasury is not short of cash. I do not want to over-emphasise that. I know that there are difficulties in the economy, that there are other commitments and that other qualifications are likely to be made. One still comes down to the fact that if that pledge is ever to be redeemed, it must be redeemed now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, at the next election, Conservative Members say that they would like to move towards ameliorating the situation when economic circumstances permit, they will have that argument stuffed down their throats unless an improvement is secured as a result of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The retrospective and precedent arguments may present technical difficulties, but they should not obscure the straightforward question of whether war widows deserve the support that we seek. On the grounds of need, loneliness and financial loss, they are special cases and deserve special treatment. It is a debt of honour owed by the Government. I am surprised at the dog-in-the-manger attitude of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from war widows, the people who are most angered by the matter in my constituency are former serving officers, the British Legion, the War Officers Pensioner Association and other laudable organisations. I pay tribute to them for the work that they have
	<span class='label label-info column'>1026</span>
done over the years. Some are becoming fed up and losing heart, and feel that they will never succeed. Some think that, in view of the unique financial circumstances this year and the opportunities presented by the resources available, if they do not win the argument this year, they never will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Greenwich that it rubs salt in the wound when comparisons are made with the treatment of war widows and war disabled in European countries and other parts of the world. The present situation is untenable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman leaves the subject of the comparative treatment of war widows in West Germany and other European countries, is he aware that by comparison with other European countries, pensioners as a whole in Britain do very badly? We are discussing proper treatment for war widows, but we should also deal with the scandalous treatment of pensioners in our society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly agree with that, but I qualify my agreement by saying that it is sometimes difficult to make direct comparisons, pension for pension, because there are different social and welfare support systems in each country. Direct comparisons can lead to erroneous conclusions, but in general I agree with the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rightly said that it was difficult to compare pensions. I am sure that he would agree that the percentage of GDP spent on the elderly is the best comparison. Does he agree that by that criterion Britain comes third out of the 12 EC countries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We could play with statistics all night, but I do not want to get involved in that argument. I said—fairly, I think—that, by manipulating the figures, statisticians can draw the conclusions that they set out to find.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked for a breakdown of the cost of £200 million and £400 million, but I agree with the hon. Member for Birkenhead that it helps our argument if we confine the discussion to the special case of widows. How is the cost arrived at? How much extra money would be needed if the amendment were accepted? I have asked the Ministry of Defence the same questions, but it seems difficult to find out the procedure by which that figure was reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birkenhead said that Conservative Back Benchers would have to examine their consciences closely when making a decision on the amendment. It will not be an easy decision for some of them to make, as it will contradict the position taken by their party Whips. However, if they do not support the amendment, it may be a decision that haunts them for the rest of their parliamentary lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my compliments should receive such a churlish reaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak on behalf of the agnostics in this debate. I have listened to everything that has been said and have been slightly surprised by those who said that a precedent cannot be drawn from raising war widows' pensions to raising invalidity benefit for former members of the Army, the Air Force and the Navy. The difficulties facing widows have been mentioned, but surely the difficulties facing those former soldiers, sailors and airmen are just as bad, if not worse. Many of them have been condemned to a life of hell on earth. They may be in wheelchairs; they may have lost both arms or both legs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham quoted from a moving letter about the plight of a widow whose late husband had lived for many years with the problem of emphysema. Did that husband not deserve the further assistance that his widow now deserves? We must examine both problems together. We cannot say that one should benefit and the other should not. If we are to help war widows, we must also help those who have left the armed forces having suffered a disability. Their problem is just as great and, in many cases, may be even greater because of their physical disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A substantial sum of money is involved. I do not believe that £600 million is a mere bagatelle. Some of us can remember the days when Chancellors of the Exchequer resigned over £50 million. We must consider the balance of trade and the problem of inflation and ask whether we can afford £600 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to the reply of my hon. Friend the Minsiter of State, who is known throughout the House as a man of great compassion. I hope that we can look forward to greater assistance being given to those who sacrificed much to secure the freedom of our people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate has been important and worthwhile, and we are all grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1028</span>
Hexham (Mr. Amos) for having initiated it so well. The hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) deserves admiration for his contribution. If I had to face the Whips, a delegation of war widows, or the hon. Member for Birkenhead as a consequence of my speeches in this Committee, I would start with the first and proceed to the third.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I signed the early-day motion and the amendment. They are both important devices to bring to the Government's attention the concern of Back Bench Members. Some people say that one should be careful when signing documents, as some day one may be called to account for it. If that were always so, Parliament would lose a way to show concern about issues. Sometimes such devices are a way of showing concern about a range of matters. That is what these devices have done this evening. The speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) helped to illustrate that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A parallel can be drawn with the early-day motion that several of my hon. Friends put down last summer on the proposed abolition of free eye tests. I signed it and was approached by a colleague of my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fallon), who asked my to withdraw my signature. I said then that I had considered the matter and would not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of this debate I shall vote according to my hon. Friend the Minister's response to our concerns. I shall not be swayed from my decision by the press, which has already listed me as a rebel, along with one or two of my hon. Friends. Nor shall I be swayed by the Whips—not even by my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington, who I have known for a long time—or by the hon. Member for Birkenhead. Conservative Members should be responsible legislators and have regard to the direct consequences of their votes, in terms of expenditure, and their indirect consequences in terms of knock-on effects and the precedents that we may establish as a result of our votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I differ from the hon. Member for Birkenhead over the moral arguments about war widows as opposed to servicemen who suffered disability as a result of war service. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South in that respect. I have an example in my family. I spent my early years in Cheshire, where the hon. Member for Birkenhead has his constituency. My grandfather, who died around the time when I was born—a long time ago—also lived there before the county was carved up. He was gassed in the first world war. My mother has told me of the considerable difficulties that the family encountered, especially in the winter when there was smoke and smog and we had a relatively low income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to say that we must help war widows but not servicemen. I do not say that simply because it is a convenient argument for the Government. It cuts both ways. The debate has illustrated the significant needs which are known to both sides of the Committee. Many of the pensioners from my constituency who write to me about the problems that they face as a consequence of recent legislation such as changes in housing benefit, cite war service. Those people fought during the war and some suffered disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1029</span>
7.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only this morning, I received a letter concerning people on low incomes and the provision for them. My constituent said that his wife served throughout the war in a munitions factory—they were often the target of enemy aircraft—and that he served throughout the war in the forces. That is typical of many constituents who write about their plight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In raising this matter, we are considering the plight of service people and their families, which was not remedied by the 1973 changes. The hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) referred proudly to his party's 1979 manifesto on child benefit, but that manifesto did not or could not say that that Government had taken measures to help war widows and the categories that we are discussing. The hon. Member for Greenwich (Mrs. Barnes) said that those people have been waiting 40 years for help, although they have received some help. That charge lies at the feet not only of Conservative but of Labour Governments. It is a consequence of the relative economic failure in this country during the 1960s and 1970s. We are now moving into a period of economic success and that greatly strengthens the argument that the Government and my hon. Friend the Minister should respond, although I accept that my hon. Friend is bound by considerable financial restrictions. We have had several debates and some of my hon. Friends have said that this is the best one although the debate on the plight of 16 to 17-year-olds was a fine one. The Government have been heavily pressed in several debates, in most of which they have been asked to incur expenditure. It is difficult for Conservative Members to ask the Government to give a concession to one category and to ignore other categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DSS has a more advanced view on this subject than the Ministry of Defence. I hope that my comments and those of my hon. Friends on the role of the Ministry of Defence will be heard. It is a tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham that, as a result of his amendment and the support in the Committee and outside for that amendment, there have been several meetings with Ministers to try to secure some movement on this matter. I hope that those meetings will produce some success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to review individual cases of hardship. War widows are proud people. They have not wanted to feel that they are begging individuals on society for help and I hope that the Government will not respond in such a way that those people must crawl on their hands and knees to Richmond terrace for help. That would be a greater insult than a small amount of material help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When voting, Conservative Members wish to give my hon. Friend the Minister the benefit of the doubt and to strengthen his hand in future negotiations with the Treasury or the Ministry of Defence. The Budget next week will be a further test of the way in which we approach the matter of equity in our society. If the issue is not satisfactorily met this evening or by the administrative measures that may flow from our debate, it will return and return. My hon. Friend who signed the early-day motion will carry out a sort of guerrilla warfare on the Government. No one will benefit, least of all our party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall end on a party note, though not quite in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1030</span>
way that Opposition Members may expect. The Conservative party will not be served if this issue hangs round our necks year after year, constantly being brought up at Question Time and on the Floor of the House whenever social legislation is debated. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will respond to the considerable anxiety felt about war widows and other categories of service people in the last war who may be in considerable difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not speak for long as the various points of view have been ably expressed in the Committee. Two or three matters emerge from our debate and it would be right to refer to those before the Minister replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments cover three broad categories—precedent, retrospection and cost. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos) on his courage in being prepard to push the matter, as I am sure that substantial pressure has been brought to bear. He argued his case and answered the remarks of some of his hon. Friends about precedent—not that he is against a wider application of the Government's generosity than that set out in his amendment. His amendment seeks to single out a group with a particular set of problems. He said that that group will, sadly, diminish year by year, but the needs and deserts of those people are considerable. We have never accepted the argument of whittling down, not that because we cannot help everybody, we should not help anybody. One of our main regrets about the progress of the Government's social security legislation is that when they see one group doing rather better than another, their natural inclination is to level down rather than up. We deplore that, and in that sense, we see the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were told by those who do not support the hon. Gentleman's proposal that retrospective legislation is bad, so the Government should not become involved. I wonder whether the supported the Government's proposal retrospectively to take away benefits from people who were widowed before April 1988, but who reached the point of change in their circumstances after that date. We all very much welcome the Government's decision not to proceed with that measure, even though they did so when they were judged to be in the wrong by the legal appeals systmem. Nevertheless, that was retrospective legislation, the effect of which would have been damaging. Conservative Members were prepared to live with that, so they should be willing to live with retrospective legislation that might benefit someone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), I should be grateful if the Minister would say something about the cost of the measure. The hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) was not sent a copy of the Conservative central office document, although I am not sure what he has done to offend central office. The brief states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"additional expenditure … is estimated to be in the region of £200 million a year."</p></blockquote>
It goes on the refer to grander sums if the hon. Gentleman's proposals were followed and those receiving invalidity benefits were included. Are those estimates of the gross cost of that benefit? In the recent changes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1031</span>
made to housing benefit, those in receipt of war pensions were among those with small extra pensions who lost some of their housing support. If the increase were to be awarded, there would be some off-setting savings. Whether that is, or is not, a good thing is another matter. Nevertheless, it would put the cost quoted in the briefing in a different light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the proposal put forward by the hon. Member for Hexham that if the Government sustain the argument that the sum involved is so large it cannot be afforded, they ought to look at the possibility of ex gratia payments. That would also deal with the precedent argument. The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the fact that the cost of these proposals is of a quite different order of magnitude to those identified in the Government papers. He offered the Government an alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) put his finger on the nub of much of the argument when he quoted from the 1983 letter from the Prime Minister—which no one has challenged—in which she said that this was something that the Government would wish to do when economic circumstances allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The letter was written when my right hon. Friend was in Opposition and the letter is dated not 5 January 1983 but 5 January 1978.

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most interested in the hon. Gentleman's observation. I have not seen the letter as it is in the possession of my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead. If the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) is right in what he says, we are most interested. Throughout the debate, Conservative Back Benchers have been telling us that we must not pay any attention to the other letter, written when the right hon. Lady was in opposition, because it was signed not by her but by a member of her staff. Now we learn that that was a disingenuous argument because there was another letter, signed by the right hon. Lady herself. Alternatively, the hon. Member for Chelmsford has misunderstood my argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead drew attention to the fact that there were two letters, one written by a member of the Prime Minister's staff and the other by herself, and no one challenged him. In any event, it appears that a letter signed by the Prime Minister—whether as Prime Minister or as Leader of the Opposition—exists, and I shall now return to what I was saying when the hon. Gentleman intervened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was about to make the point, when the hon. Member for Chelmsford and then the Minister intervened, that the Government have always put the case that this is something that it would be desirable to do when circumstances permit. I have not the slightest doubt that in exactly one week from this evening, we shall be listening to the Chancellor of the Exchequer telling us that this is the most successful Government of modern times, that he is the most successful Chancellor of modern times and that the Government are having unparalleled economic success such as has not been seen since the days of nero or anyone else whom comes to mind—I am afraid that I used a physical comparison. I have no doubt that the Chancellor will be telling us that everything is wonderful and that no Government have ever been so successful. It is quite valid for us to say that the Government, who themselves say that they are awash with money and that their only problems are those of success, should be considering these proposals now. It is hard to see when otherwise they will be brought in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I most sincerely congratulate the hon. Member for Hexham on his courage. It is fair and right to say to Conservative Members that Opposition Members are prepared to support the amendment and new clause if the Conservatives have the courage of their convictions and press them to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one could be a Member of this House for long without being aware of the strength of the feelings aroused by the issue of pensions for war widows. The debate has been of a high quality, and from the first speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Amos), the truth has come through that while we acknowledge that it is shocking and traumatic enough to be widowed at all, there is an extra dimension to being a war widow. The country feels that we owe such widows a debt over and beyond that normally recognised for other widows. The depths of enduring sadness and in some cases bitterness revealed in the letters read to the Committee by my hon. Friend will long be remembered by those who heard them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We acknowledge that war widows should be treated more generously than others. In his powerful and moving speech, my hon. Friend made many important points. Before moving to my main argument, I shall deal with one or two details. First there are the figures. I have already mentioned that about 1,000 World War 1 widows and 2,000 World War 2 widows die every year. That loss is offset by the award of new pre-1973 widows benefits—there were 1,500 in the past full year. In 1988 there was an overall reduction of 1,800 in the total of pre-1973 widows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we must establish who is eligible. There has been some talk as though war pensions were paid only to the widows of those killed in action. They are payable to the widows of those whose death is attributable to their service in either peace or war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to quibble too much about the amendment and the new clause, but for the record I should say something about them. The Committee may have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1033</span>
picked up from what I have said about the numbers that the wording of the new clause is defective. It refers to those widowed before or after 1973, but the crucial issue is not when the husband died but when his service in the armed forces ended. One scheme applies if his service ended on or before 31 March 1973 and the enhanced scheme, as well as the old scheme, applies if service ended after that date. Even if the new clause were accepted by a vote of the Commitee, it would not achieve the effect that those who drafted it intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A war pensions committee would be an inappropriate way to tackle the issue, although I understand that my hon. Friends used the idea in order to remain within order while dealing with war widows pensions under the Bill. I make no complaint about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the sum would be calculated under the new clause would be immensely complicated. I suppose that technically it would be possible to amalgamate a war widows pension, which is tax-free, with a service pension, which is taxed, and calculate each individual award so as to achieve the aim of the new clause, but it would be difficult. I understand why some people may describe that as a quibble, but I thought it right to put those objections on the record. I realise that my hon. Friends and others want a serious discussion on the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the outset, I remind the Committee of the Government's record. During our period in office, we have taken several modest but important steps to improve the situation of war widows. In 1979 we moved from 50 per cent taxability to a 100 per cent tax-free war widows pension. In 1984, we enhanced the age allowance. My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham made an important point about the increasing burden of old age borne by those ladies. In 1987, we made improvements in the payments for funeral costs and increased the disregard in 1988 from £4 to £5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are modest but not unimportant steps that acknowledge the duty of the Government and society to those ladies. Earlier, I said that war widows should be treated more generously than others and my hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) supported that view vigorously as, almost universally, did other members of the Committee. Others made the point that the rate of war widows pension is 30 per cent higher than that of a national insurance pensioner. From April, an extra £6.10 will be payable to those of the age of 65, £12.20 from age 70 and £15.30 from age 80. Some 85 per cent of war widows are entitled to some form of age allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pensions are tax free and those who have worked, as many of the widows from world war 2 will have done, are entitled to a retirement pension in their own right on top of their war widows pension. Of those in receipt of war widows pensions, 75 per cent are also in receipt of retirement pensions. As was said, war widows pensions are not income related, so the occupational pensions earned by a substantial number of war widows can be added to their income without damaging their entitlement to the war widows pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the arguments that we heard today were based on equity. Why should one group of widows be treated differently, to and less generously than, others because they are divided by an arbitrary date? About
	<span class='label label-info column'>1034</span>
1,200 widows are entitled to the armed forces attributable widows pension, which is the more generous scheme operated by the Ministry of Defence, and 57,000 come under the old scheme. I understand the argument for equity and in an ideal world one would want to treat all who had suffered in a similar way in the same fashion. The Committee must set against the arguments for equity, which I agree have some force, the arguments about retrospection and cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle that changes in occupational pension schemes should not be restrospective is almost universally recognised in both public and private sector schemes. That is not to say that the payments are not retrospective, but the entitlement should not be made retrospective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that in 1972 there was a tremendous enhancement in a large number of public service pension schemes for civil servants, teachers, policemen, firemen and National Health and local authority employees. The new schemes had a more generous basis and, of course, they were not retrospective. They did not apply the new rules to those who were already in a scheme; only new entrants benefited from them. In 1973, when the Ministry of Defence introduced its scheme, it adopted the same approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to say that each time we enhanced the benefits of public service pensions and made them more generous for new entrants we should apply the rules retrospectively for everybody within the scheme, the chances of achieving improvements in those pensions would be substantially inhibited because Government of all parties would judge the costs to be too great. Therefore, over the years the decision has been that when the rules of a scheme are changed, the new entrants will benefit from the enhanced scheme, and I believe that that approach is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) asked whether ours was the right Committee to consider this matter and there are two routes that we could take to achieve the aim of my hon. Friend's new clause. We could either backdate the armed forces' attributable widows pension to the beginning, or enhance the war widows pension under my Department's scheme. I shall deal with both, but it is worth while dealing first with cost. I shall respond to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwichshire (Mr. Kirk-wood) shortly, but there is no doubt that the enhancement for war widows would cost £200 million. That is calculated on the basis of the estimated average rate of pension of those pre-1973 widows who receive it. The figure that has been chosen is £73 a week. That would include not just the basic war widows pension, but the age addition and differential for rank that are inherent in the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not surprised at the Minister looking slightly quizzical at my remarks. The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) made the point more clearly than I did. I was referring to net costs. The hon. Gentleman's figure is helpful, but can the Department assess the consequential knock-on effect on housing and other benefits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As Iain Macleod once said, "Don't interrupt me at a comma". I was about to say that the only
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1035</span>
figure I have available at present is £200 million. In due course, we shall refine that. It is the gross cost, as is the sum of £400 million for the knock-on effects to entitle service men to have the benefits of the enhanced scheme. Those figures give us a gross total of £600 million, which is not an insigificant amount of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) was unduly dismissive about the proposition that it would be difficult to ring-fence war widows as opposed to service men who had been disabled and were entitled to war pensions. I am not nearly as sanguine about that as he was. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South made a significant comment about that. We are talking about groups of people, not individual cases. Let us consider a widow who, after the end of the second world war, had a full working career and earned both her national insurance and occupational pension payments. It would be difficult to set that individual case against one which involved a person who was severely disabled during the second world war, had been in a wheelchair ever since and was unable to work fully, if at all. We would be in an unsustainable position if we were to enhance the arrangements for widows to ignore those for service men who had suffered as a result of war injuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress to my hon. Friends especially that if the Ministry of Defence found the £600 million for the enhancement, that would represent about 3.5 per cent of its budget. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence would probably give me rather short shrift if I were to suggest to him what his priorities should be, and that that considerable sum of money should be spent in such a way, even in these days of relaxed international tension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, proposes an alternative method by which the war widows existing pension would be enhanced. That would lead to another difficulty that has been touched on more than once during our proceedings. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, my hon. Friends and myself have been trying to ensure that the massive amount of public money that is spent on social security benefits focuses on those who need it most. There must be a judicious mixture of universal and income-related benefits but, where possible, we have been trying to identify areas—the poorer pensioner package has been mentioned today—where extra help is really needed. I believe that that is the right policy, and that it is generally supported by Conservative Members. In those circumstances, we must ask ourselves whether it is right to devote significant extra resources from the social security budget now to a group that, as a whole, is better off than many in our society, although I am not saying that there are no cases of individual hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To consider the matter properly, we ought to look at individual circumstances in individual cases. Furthermore, would it be right to help widows without acknowledging our debt to the service men? These are difficult issues which Members of the Committee have debated in a serious manner. We have had an excellent debate. In which emotions have been under the surface rather than flaunted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1036</span>
To sum up, we are talking about a group of widows who deserve our sympathy and concern and who we all agree should be entitled to preferential treatment in Benefits that puts them ahead of other widows. That is what happens in practice now. If a man's service ended on or before 31 March 1973 and if his death was attributable to his service in the armed forces, his widow will receive a benefit some 30 per cent higher than her own sister, for example, who may be the widow of a civilian. The war widow will also be eligible for the age additions that I have outlined, and will have the benefit of a tax-free pension. In that group, 75 per cent of people are also entitled to state retirement pensions, and a not inconsiderable number have occupational pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about hardship in the sense that the Department of Social Security normally uses the term. I acknowledge the force of the argument behind equity, but I do not believe that it would be right to ignore the costs in the matter, or the principle of retrospection that is applied throughout the public service pension area. If we accept the measure for the armed forces, what about policemen and firemen who may have been injured or lost their lives as a result of enemy action, or in other ways? It would be very difficult to ring-fence this in a sensible effective and sustainable way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not there a fundamental difference between people who are conscripted to fight and then die, and people who volunteer for a job, knowing that it might lead to an increased chance of being killed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have made no distinction at all in the provision for injuries or widowhood between those who volunteered for the armed forces and those who were conscripted. It is right that there should be no distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that if asked, the Committee will reject the amendment. However, I should like to meet hon. Members to try and assess the extent of hardship in individual cases. There is a whole range of ex-service charities. I do not despise those who contribute to and operate charitable organisations, which identify the need among ex-service personnel and their widows. Last year, £35 million plus was spent on that provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall not give way at the moment. This is an important part of the provision. Fellow citizens, former comrades and existing members of the armed forces contribute to such charities so that hardship cases can be helped in a flexible and compassionate way. Those organisations should make an important contribution in this area. Perhaps the Government, too, should make some extra contribution. I would like to meet and talk to hon. Members to see whether I can assess the extent of hardship that is at present not met in either of those two ways. Having considered the evidence, I could then decide whether it would be right for the Government to do anything. In the light of that, I hope that the Committee, if asked, will reject the amendment which is, in any case, defective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, the Minister has shown himself to be a kind, considerate, compassionate and caring man. I mean that sincerely. I am glad that he has considered the issue in this Committee: I do not think that we should have received such a helpful response had it been dealt with by someone else in a Committee dealing with defence matters. I would want to judge the success or otherwise of the amendment and the new clause by the progress that we have made on two fronts. Is there now a genuine acceptance that there is a problem? When it is accepted that there is a problem, it implies that something will be done about it. Secondly, will there be any genuine progress on moves towards righting this injustice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main preoccupation is not with how that progress is achieved, as long as it is achieved, or necessarily when that happens as long as it is as soon as possible. Throughout this debate and well before today's discussion my hon. Friend the Minister has been busily sympathetic to the cause. I also know that a fair resolution to the problem may lie elsewhere with other Departments where, for some extraordinary reason, Ministers do not understand the principles involved as clearly as do the Ministers on this Committee. At this stage it is only right and proper for me to express my genuine and sincere thanks to the Minister for the action that he has already taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Minister's reference to meeting hon. Members who are concerned about this, and liaising with ex-service men's organisations meets the concern and preserves the dignity of those war widows who are in difficulty? They will not have to apply directly. He is asking hon. Members and the organisations to make some assessment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say a few words about that presently. Much tough talking has been undertaken since the amendment was tabled some weeks ago, despite the various changes in its form for technical reasons. That has been encouraging. Without the amendment and the new clause, nothing would have happened. There has been an implicit acknowledgement that this is a serious matter which needs to be resolved; it will not go away. I hope that we do not return, this year and the year after, to discuss the same matter using the same arguments. However, that on its own is not enough basis for future progress when we return to the issue elsewhere and at a different time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman almost suggests that the Minister's answer has been satisfactory. My interpretation of his response is very different from that of the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson). I thought that the Minister was saying that widows did have to grovel—although that was not the word he used—to Richmond terrace. It now seems all right if some organisation does that grovelling for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other thing that we want to know is the time scale. The hon. Gentleman said that the time did not matter, but is not time of the essence? Many of these women are very old. Do we not want the Minister to do some negotiating and have some discussions with his hon. Friend before Report and to inform us of the outcome rather than to let the Report stage pass by?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1038</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made some valid points. I said that time did not matter as long as it happens as soon as possible. We can have any colour of car as long as it is black. It is that sort of argument. Of course, time is of the essence. This time next year there will probably be 3,000 fewer war widows. Whatever we are talking about, it has to happen as soon as possible. There are practicalities in getting an extra £200 million out of the Government at this stage of the financial year in any case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member invite the Minister to intervene to say that he would expect these negotiations to be carried out, either on Report, in the other place, or when we consider amendments from the other place? Those are the three stages when it would be proper to expect the Minister to conduct the negotiations. As the hon. Gentleman has moved the amendment, will he invite the Minister to intervene in his summing-up speech and give us an undertaking about the time scale?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the arguments and I am very grateful to all hon. Members for the constructive and co-operative spirit in which we have discussed the matter. I am glad that party politics have been kept out, because they have no place in such an issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened especially carefully to my hon. Friend the Minister, and I am prepared to accept that there may be one or two technical difficulties with the point at which service ends—whether it is pre-1973 or post 1973 and the use of the new clause. The Minister was gracious enough to accept that we had to do it that way; there is no other way. I accept also that there have been a number of improvements recently and that there is some force in the argument about the effects of the improvements for new entrants on the existing members of any scheme. If we have to do something for everybody beforehand, there will never be any improvements for the future. I accept also the point about the relative prosperity of a war widow compared with the deep hardship of an invalid. One case may be less deserving than another, but one person falls into the category of war widow and one does not, and the person who gets the benefit may not be so needy of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the other argument, we must get rid of it once and for all. You, Sir Paul, are a wise and generous man—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: He cannot vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that he cannot vote. As the wise and generous man of the Committee, I put a question to you, Sir Paul. Is there not a clear distinction between somebody whose husband was killed in war and somebody whose husband was injured in war? We are discussing widows. If something else arises because our proposal is used as precedent, let the course of time deal with that. But let us not worry about not doing something because we have not done something else. Let us take it step by step, for goodness sake, or we shall never get anywhere on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to what my hon. Friend the Minister said. At the end of his speech I became a little
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1039</span>
more optimistic that something might happen. However, I ask my hon. Friend if—when I have concluded my comments—he will be a little more specific on the time scale for his discussions. I think that that may present a way out, and although it is not enough for most members of the Committee, we must accept what we can get. I am prepared to accept it if he will be a little more specific on the time scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us take it step by step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we all want is improvement for that group of pre-1973 war widows. Therefore, I shall ask the Committee's leave to withdraw the amendment and new clause at this stage for two reasons. First, I sincerely wish to avoid a Division which I am afraid would inevitably be along party lines and, therefore, we would risk a defeat. Secondly, it is essential to maintain all-party support for what we have been trying to do. There is no doubt that if the amendment and new clause are not withdrawn, our all-party campaign will have been dealt a setback because its all-party nature will have been undermined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am dealing with reality. I understand the feelings of Opposition Members; it is difficult for me, too. I want to achieve something and if we press the amendment to a Division and it ^s defeated—as I believe it will be—where do we go from there? What improvement will we have achieved for the pre-1973 war widows?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>8 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question that we must also discuss is what will we have anyway, whether we vote or not? I make a further plea, because I have put my name to the amendment and I have a right to be consulted on whether it is withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are three further stages in the cycle of this Bill—Report, the other place and consideration of Lords' amendments—when we could be told about the timing of these negotiations, and it is not unreasonable to ask this of the Government. For us to walk away today, without even getting that to offer war widows, is a pretty poor deal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall return to this issue in a different place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I am sure that he listened carefully to the Minister's reply. I detected in it a
synethesis of a plan—which has been used in previous social security Bills—to hijack the quite considerable charitable funds that have quite rightly been built up out of sympathy for war widows and use those funds to argue that some other scheme can be developed. I honestly believe—I wish the hon. Gentleman would think very carefully about this—that the function of Committee members considering a Bill is to try to achieve the best that they can. My experience is that, if one does not win in Committee, one does not win on the Floor of the House. It is much better to press an issue within a Committee,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1040</span>
where there is a chance of winning it. There is then a position to defend on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amos</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall return to this issue. I have no intention of undermining the position of, or making life difficult for, a Minister who is, and has been, sympathetic. I hope that hon. Members will bear that in mind, if want progress. Of course we are talking about tactics—we are all politicians, we know what it is about. We have an honourable and sympathetic Minister who made some offer. We can perhaps press him further on the time scale, but for goodness sake let us take what we can get, otherwise we will end up with nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak again, and I was going to go along with what the proposer of the amendment and the new clause wished, but the Minister has not moved. He has not given us that timetable. We have nothing from this debate to offer to war widows. Let me turn the argument round. How would we feel if we were this kind, compassionate concerned Minister who is fighting his corner with the Treasury? Would not his position be strengthened if we were to carry the amendment, knowing that it is defective and cannot be implemented, that it had to come back, and that other proposals had to be made? Would not his position, as the Minister, be strengthened in that case? Rather than sending the Minister into the conference chamber naked—
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> That might well get the Treasury to give way!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a right to know what that timetable is, otherwise we are being bought off. As much as I wanted to support the hon. Member for Hexham for all the skill and finesse that he has marshalled in promoting this campaign, it would be wrong for us to go away tonight without at least offering war widows the assurance that the Government accept the urgency of these negotiations and that, within a time scale, the issue will come back to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I understand the reasons why he may withdraw his support of the amendment, as is his right, I shall not be withdrawing my name from it and I shall push the amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for Hexham and others will vote for it. There will then be great excitement to the end of the debate. Hon. Members will know perfectly well that although the amendment cannot stand as it is because it cannot be put into law, the Government will have to respond, and we will have strengthened the Minister's hand considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I genuinely think that Conservative Members have misread the signs from the Minister. I think that he wants a defeat on this amendment, because it will massively strengthen his hand. He dare not say so, because it would be more than his job was worth if it got out that he believed it would strengthen his hand. If we have a good story, we tend to tell it to our mates. Like Oscar Wilde, I can keep a secret—the people to whom I tell it cannot. What the Minister said would have moved like a bushfire round the Tory party. Let us send him to the Treasury with a vote of confidence. He knows that the amendment cannot be put into law, but that the Committee wants concessions from the Government on the time scale and on plans to improve the position of this group.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1041</span>
The Minister explained that there were knock-on problems, which I did not realise and which must be taken into consideration. He made a valid point when he told us how those who were injured in war would be treated. My earlier intervention was facile, as I did not understand the complexity of the matter. If I were the Minister for Social Security, I should want to leave the Committee this evening knowing that, although I had fought my corner well, the Committee had voted £200 million for me to bargain with the Treasury. When we come to vote, I hope that Conservative members of the Committee, who know that the amendment cannot stand, will strengthen the Minister's hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
