	<div class='legislation'>Draft Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (Amendment) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Ms Glenda Jackson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 (Amendment) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
This is the first time, Mr. Atkinson, that I have had the privilege of serving on a Committee under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order will permit local authorities to authorise 20 mph speed limits on their own roads. The current law requires the consent of the Secretary of State to be obtained for any limit below 30 mph—the national urban speed limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of 20 mph zones was formulated in the late 1980s, and the first were introduced in 1991. As the majority of injury accidents—especially those involving pedestrians, cyclists and children—occur on urban roads, it was surmised that simply putting up signs would not succeed in slowing the traffic down. Other measures, including road humps, were devised to slow down the traffic physically. The Transport Research Laboratory was commissioned to monitor the first 200 20 mph zones. The results, in road safety terms, were impressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TRL report was placed in the Library at the time of its publication in 1996. It concluded, on comparison of accidents and speeds before and after the introduction of zones, that injury accidents were reduced by about 60 per cent., child injury accidents by 67 per cent., pedestrian accidents by 63 per cent. and pedal cyclist accidents by 29 per cent. There is therefore no doubt that the 20 mph zone has been highly successful in slowing traffic where necessary and in reducing accident casualties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The zones have been in place for up to eight years, and local highway authorities have eight years of experience in their development and placement. We therefore feel that they should now be allowed to introduce such zones without reference to the Secretary of State. The draft order will achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order has two aims. First, it will provide local highway authorities with the flexibility and freedom to introduce 20 mph speed limits where they think fit. Secondly, it will retain the successful qualities of the existing 20 mph zone concept by making minor adjustments to existing regulations to provide a system in which authorities may introduce either signed 20 mph zones or 20 mph zones with the necessary traffic calming features.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Those changes will permit self-enforcing, traffic-calmed 20 mph zones, or 20 mph speed limits with repeater signs. The key point is that local traffic authorities will be able to choose. The proposal to allow local authorities such flexibility and discretion received overwhelming support when the Department held a formal consultation last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councils must consult the police and all emergency services about speed limit changes and traffic calming. In addition, the proposals must be consistent with the agreed plans under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, according to which speed is a local concern that forms part of the required crime and disorder audit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change matches our general approach to funding local authority transport strategies, which in future will be based on local transport plans. Money will no longer be earmarked for specific projects, and local authorities will be given the freedom to decide how to spend resources to meet their local integrated transport strategies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the order the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by giving the apologies of my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) for his non attendance. He has to be in the Chamber for the debate on road haulage, which he will wind up later today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for providing to all Committee Members prior to these proceedings a note setting out the main points of the order, which, as she said, is straightforward. We shall not oppose the order, but I would like to raise a few points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the reasons why Conservative Members are pleased by the order, which is an eminently logical step following the success of the trials, is that we recognise—as a new Member, I certainly do—the importance of giving power back to local authorities and allowing them the freedom to decide. That is completely in keeping with how Conservative Members now see things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present procedures are rather onerous—I am sure the Minister is aware of that, as she is on the end of the process—because they involve constant approvals for schemes piecemeal. The temporary orders that have sometimes been granted can—at least in the opinion of the House of Commons Library—sometimes be legally unsound. Temporary solutions must, of course, be revisited by local government, which takes time, money and energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave some interesting statistics about improved safety for vulnerable road users—children waiting to cross the road, cyclists and others—to show that they would benefit from a 20 mph speed limit. The pedestrian fatality figures given to me by the Library show a significant distinction between the 20 mph and 30 mph speed limits. The statistics are sobering. At 20 mph, only 5 per cent. of accidents are fatal for pedestrians; at 30 mph, the figure goes up to 45 per cent.; and at 40 mph, 85 per cent. of pedestrians are fatally injured. We are not talking about an arbitrary change in the speed limit, but one that will make a significant difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Will the Minister look closely at the effectiveness of the 20 mph speed limit? She said that a speed limit sign is often not enough. Those who drive know that to be true. She said that speed limits must be accompanied by other measures such as humps, pinch points and rumble strips. A plethora of measures have been tried to calm traffic, but the experience of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians is that the speed-calming measures chosen are not always appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will give local authorities more power to decide where 20 mph speed limits should apply and what engineering measures should be used to make them effective. I wonder whether an appeal process might be provided. Local residents and the agencies that the Minister cited—particularly the emergency services—often find that speed-retarding mechanisms are in the wrong place or of the wrong sort and they should be able to appeal to get them changed. For instance, the speed humps installed in the road where I live were put at the wrong end of a no-entry road, so the traffic goes over the hump not when it enters the road but at the end. That was an oversight, but it rendered the humps less effective. Another example is that of mini-roundabouts; they are meant to slow traffic, but cars are driven straight over them as if they were not there. Although I support the order, I would welcome an appeal mechanism to give local residents a say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Events in my constituency pose another interesting question. Local communities often appeal for a slowing of traffic through the area in which they live because drivers often blatantly break the speed restrictions. It is difficult to stop that happening if there is nothing other than a 30 mph sign. The parish council of a village in my constituency, Hampton-in-Arden, has asked whether, if it can raise the money for the engineering measures required to enforce the speed restriction, any objection would be raised to its installing the engineering works. When an audit was taken of what sort of speed retarding measures the village would like, the residents were overwhelmingly in favour of cameras.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure the Minister is aware, that is the most expensive option. The West Midlands police informed me that a speed camera costs between £14,500 and £17,500, and—I find this difficult to understand—the pole and cabinet on which it must stand cost another £15,000 to £22,000. Undeterred, Hampton-in-Arden parish council was none the less willing to spend that sort of money. However, it has met resistance from the local authority and the police in taking matters into its own hands. I should be interested to hear the Minister's view. The waiting list for such engineering measures is between two and three years. Experience shows that it takes a fatality in a community before engineering measures to enforce the speed limit are introduced. No one likes to wait for an accident to happen. I should like the Minister to comment on those points if she is able to do so, but fundamentally, Opposition Members welcome the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Adrian Sanders

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Atkinson. It is the first time that I have experienced your chairmanship, and I do not think that you will have any problems with me or, indeed, with any other member of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give credit where it is due to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker), whose early-day motion 310 called for 20 mph speed limits to be imposed outside schools without the need to seek approval from the Secretary of State. I must also congratulate the Government on listening and consulting and on designing a mechanism that allows local government some freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I suspect that the Minister will not be able to produce a rabbit out of a hat, I hope that she might be able to have a word with others in the Government about enforcement. On several roads in my constituency, motorists break existing speed limits of 30 mph. The word from the police is that the paperwork connected with enforcement is such that they could spend all their time enforcing speed limits, and any other criminal activity would go unpunished. Therefore we need to examine the question of enforcement, which involves a Minister responsible for transport. Perhaps the Minister has already had discussions with the Home Secretary about how to reduce the amount of paperwork associated with enforcement actions used by the police in enforcing speed limits. It is all very well imposing speed limits, but if they are not enforced, they will be ignored and will have been a waste of everyone's time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the Government on listening and in particular on allowing local government such freedom, which is a welcome step. I hope that in years to come, when road traffic accident statistics become available, the Minister can take some credit for having introduced the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Viggers 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gosport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would describe myself as persuadable but as yet unpersuaded. I declare interests as a motorist, a cyclist and a pedestrian, and my attitude to the road and other road users depends entirely on which capacity I am operating in. As a motorist, I find that pedestrians get in the way; as a pedestrian, I find that motorists sometimes come at me at great speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The attitudes of local authorities will no doubt be influenced mainly by their local residents—the people who vote for the councillors—so they will tend to err towards the pedestrian element. A local authority serving a small village will be subject to tremendous pressure from the local community to impose speed restrictions. I once lived in an area that abutted on a trunk road. A strong local movement was in favour of traffic humps and a 30 mph speed limit on that trunk road. Local residents were worried only about crossing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the road and not about the proper flow of traffic. I am worried that the Government now propose to tilt the balance away from the national interest—which the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions no doubt always had in mind—towards local authorites, which will have local residents' interests at heart in almost every case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already found that driving through some villages is rather like driving through toy town, with all the traffic-calming measures, some of which are, frankly, quite dangerous, especially those that narrow the road from two lanes to one. I am worried that the Government are tilting the balance in favour of those who support pedestrian interests and traffic calming—traffic slowing—without taking proper account of the flow of freight and passenger traffic, which is so important to this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Minister put the order before us without giving some facts. How many orders for 20 mph limits have been requested in recent years? How many orders were granted? How many were refused? How many of them were thought to be frivolous? How many orders can be expected under these proposals? How will the applications be monitored, or at least recorded? Most importantly, what will happen if so many 20 mph and other limits are imposed under the order that traffic is seriously inhibited?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.47 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Tyrie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chichester)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am wary of the order. There is probably good reason for having central control: national interests can conflict with local interests, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Mr. Viggers) has said. The supporters of such measures are likely to be concentrated and vociferous. They generally seem to have a moral case because they can refer to local casualties or near-casualties in pleading their case. Their opponents—those who favour the retention of an existing speed limit—will be a diffuse group and will seem to condone what many of us might think of as irresponsible behaviour, expecially that involving speeding. The opponents will be those who drive through an area, not those who live there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong theoretical economic case for trying to maximise, not minimise, the flow of traffic on roads. Every journey is an economic journey. In a market economy, no economic distinction exists between granny visiting her relatives and a delivery van, performing a more clearly economic task. They are both equally relevant and should be considered equally. If speed limits exist, journeys will be slower. Journeys will take longer, so more cars will be on the road during a given period. Some people will not make a journey, which carries an economic cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a flat in the City of London. As a consequence of the bomb in Leadenhall Street at St. Mary Axe, dramatic changes were made and traffic-calming measures were introduced in the City. Contrary to what people might think, the quality of life of City
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
residents has arguably fallen. If I want to go shopping on a Saturday, I can no longer drive my car on any of the minor roads to go to the supermarket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order will almost certainly lead to reduced speed limits in the City. I would be surprised if the City of London corporation did not introduce 20 mph speed limits after the order comes into force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear similarity between lower speed limits, road humps and holes in the road—they all reduce the flow of traffic and carry an economic cost. In theory, that cost should be taxed. The argument for taxing holes in the road is well known, but in theory, reductions in speed limits might also ultimately merit consideration for some sort of general taxation to reflect the fact that they reduce economic activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall leave the Minister with one thought. The Government make it clear in the transport White Paper that a review of all speed limits will be undertaken. Will the Government produce a comprehensive economic study of the costs of speed limits, so that we can make a better assessment of the effects, for example, of reducing speed limits to 20 mph in local neighbourhoods?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.51 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall touch on what the hon. Members for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) and for Gosport perceive to be the deleterious impact on the economic life of this country of the introduction of low speed limits. The greatest economic burden born by industry and business is the congestion on our roads. There is so much traffic that, in a sense, speed limits are irrelevant because traffic moves incredibly slowly.

The Confederation of British Industry and other organisations, which have no particular political axe to grind, have provided evidence that congestion costs alone in this country are running at £20 billion a year; the environmental costs have yet to be calculated. I may not have this entirely accurate, but the most recent report on traffic speeds in London shows that congestion means that, on average, we are travelling across this great capital city at lower speeds than we were travelling across it 100 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The best evidence that I recall is that traffic is now travelling at the same speed in London as it was 100 years, 50 years, 30 years and 10 years ago. London is a special case in which road use is rationed by congestion. We are discussing a speed limit that could ration road use in other areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If great economic disbenefit resulted from congestion in areas where 20 mph limits may be introduced, it would be logical to increase the amount of road space available and the speed at which the traffic flows, so that there is less congestion. Clearly, the slower traffic moves, the more congestion there will be. The Under-Secretary's argument is illogical; I am advocating not an increase in speed limits, but great caution in the introduction of any generalised reduction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon. Gentleman was advocating a return to the now discredited policy of predict and provide, and of laying down more concrete

and increasing the number of roads. Evidence shows that all roads do is attract more traffic on to them, which replicates the congestion from which this country is suffering because of the failure of the previous Administration to do anything about creating an integrated transport policy—which is one of the first things that this Government have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hastings and Rye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the order would be of significant economic benefit to the national health service? Given the figures that she mentioned, there will be enormous savings to both life and limb.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. It has been estimated that, on average, 24,000 premature deaths a year can be linked directly to environmental pollution caused by severe congestion on our roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that we are discussing 20 mph speed limits. I should be grateful if hon. Members could focus their attention on the order. We do not want a general debate on traffic or speed limits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. However, may I clarify the order because there seems to be a smidgen of misunderstanding about our debate on the part of the hon. Members for Chichester and for Gosport? If the order is agreed by the Committee, it will be possible for local authorities, without having to make reference to the Secretary of State, to introduce 20 mph zones or 20 mph speed limits on the roads of which they are the highway authorities in charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the concerns of the hon. Member for Gosport about such measures being introduced ad hoc on the national trunk road system are unnecessary. Such zones and limits are of great benefit, which is why they were introduced in 1981 in discreet residential areas. I have already enumerated the enormous benefits of reducing the urban speed limit from 30 miles per hour to 20 miles per hour in terms of children, who are obviously the most vulnerable group, pedestrians and cyclists. The hon. Member for Gosport was concerned about the number of zones that have been put in place. There are 300 such zones at the moment; I cannot tell him how many proposals might have been turned down. Local authorities cannot arbitrarily introduce such zones or limits without close consultation or wide examination of the implications for other roads in the area. No local authority would wish to introduce such zoning or limits if the only impact on the local community were an increase in rat running. The hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman) spoke about a scheme in her constituency where traffic calming had been introduced at one end of the road but forgotten at the other; that may not have been forgetfulness on the part of local authority—that part of the road may have posed the greatest danger because it abutted a major road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Viggers</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the information that 300 schemes have been approved, but a more interesting statistic would be the number refused by the Department, because those schemes will presumably go ahead when the order is passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall attempt to obtain the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, if such information exists. I repeat that it would be unusual for a local authority arbitrarily to introduce such a scheme or limit outwith a wider scheme to handle traffic and transport in residential areas; local authorities have to meet the demands of reducing accidents and ensuring a better quality of life for residents in such areas. It would be highly unlikely that any local authority would enter into such a scheme or make such a proposal without engaging in the sort of consultation to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gosport also touched on the issue of monitoring. Monitoring will be and is an essential part of our proposals. Grateful though I am for the support of the hon. Members for Lewes for 20 mph zones, I am sure that he would not claim exclusive responsibility for the introduction of the proposals that we are debating. The hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) touched on enforcement. The issue of enforcement, particularly of speed limits, causes anxiety to us all. I took his point on the police. The police are undoubtedly often overstretched and in the past have not been required to prioritise traffic offences and road offences as we now wish them to do. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires local authorities to consult closely with community residents and we will see a change on the part of the police in that regard. One of the great virtues of 20 mph zones and limits is that they are effectively self-enforcing. With the exception of the hon. Members for Chichester and for Gosport, we all argued for lower speed limits, most usefully on safety grounds because of the reduction in accidents that would result. Undoubtedly, we do not observe limits with the passion and commitment that we sometimes ask for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Meriden for her courtesy and for welcoming the Government's proposals. She asked several questions about the physical features of such schemes. A volume of advice has been issued on the subject, and local authorities can undertake work under regulations that detail the sort of features that may be used in traffic-calming zones. It is also incumbent upon local authorities to consult; they must certainly consult the emergency services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initial traffic-calming features, popularly known as "sleeping policemen", are now disappearing, and we now see far more with a cushion effect. That change is due, in no small part, to representations made by individuals, road user groups and the emergency services. Advice on best practice is available to local authorities. I have already said that monitoring will be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also asked whether it would be possible for a parish council in her constituency to introduce traffic-calming measures of its own, if it could raise sufficient funds. She said that the most
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
popular choice of the residents of that village was speed cameras. As I have said, it is not for local authorities or parish councils arbitrarily to introduce such schemes. They must consult and take account the impact that such zones or speed limits would have on surrounding roads, because none of us drives neatly up and down only one road. Wide consultation would be needed before such speed limits could be introduced—

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyrie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister for a second time whether she is prepared to give a commitment to ensure that a comprehensive analysis of the full
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
economic effects of speed limits, including the 20 mph speed limit, will be included in the report promised in the transport White Paper when it is published in six months' or a year's time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The transport White Paper was published last year. I am not quite clear to what the hon. Gentleman is referring, but I would be happy to find out whether such an analysis already exists. I have already pointed out to the hon. Gentleman that the greatest economic burden is the number of vehicles on our roads, not the speed at which they travel.
