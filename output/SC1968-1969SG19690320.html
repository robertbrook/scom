	<section>

	<div class='bill'>HOUSING (SCOTLAND) BILL</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed</i> [
	<i>18th March</i>],
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the Housing (Scotland) Bill in relation to the principle of the Bill.—[
	<i>Mr. Ross.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hannan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our last sitting I was referring to the question of environment. In paragraph 6 of the White Paper we find the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the neglect and dilapidation of the common closes and staircases and the back courts have often overwhelmed the good intentions of individual householders".</p></blockquote>
These are very wise words and I am very glad that attention has been drawn to that aspect, because there is nothing more dismal in the type of house with which we shall be dealing here than the four blocks of tenement buildings round a square, so that the housewife, who normally works at the back, looks on to a most depressing outlook.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We will not sort this out by legislation. It calls for discipline in several ways, including discipline among neighbours co-operating to keep entries, courts and stairheads clear. Unfortunately, many people who have been living in conditions of this kind for many years become inured to them and pay little attention to them. Just as one bad apple will spoil the lot in the barrel, one bad neighbour can create confusion and enmity in these circumstances. I hope that neither the Committee nor the Ministers will think this is an unimportant matter but that where there are a number of these buildings to be improved they will do what they can by suggesting to local authorities that there might be a need for considering the appointment of janitors or caretakers to ensure that these places are kept clean and tidy. There is a need for parental discipline, in this as in so many other fields. It is deplorable to see children quite deliberately attacking the cement and other surroundings of the area and thus adding to the deterioration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
This does not apply only to private property. Some local authorities, including, I am sorry to say, my own, the Glasgow authority, could do a great deal more in maintaining and looking after some of these blocks. I wonder how long it has been since some of the gutters and courts were cleaned. Gutters having been filled with water, they pour over and drip down at the back of the entries to some of the courts, making it impossible for householders to get to refuse bins at the back. If my hon. Friend is to tender advice to local authorities in this matter they might be asked to give greater attention to the development of systems of refuse cleaning and collection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome that part of the Bill which now clears up the ambiguity of the old Section 11 of the 1962 Act. The need for this became obvious in the aftermath of the Glasgow storm and that goes a long way to explain some of the difficulties of my right hon. Friend and the Minister of State when they were charged, quite unworthily, with not showing greater concern and urgency. The new power of local authorities to serve notice on property owners that the owners must repair these properties themselves or the local authority will do it and send the bill to the owners is to be welcomed. I believe that is an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my right hon. Friend will not consider this Bill as an alternative to the excellent record of new house building which the Government are now achieving. We know that their record is an all-time one, and when hon. Members opposite claim to have a monopoly of interest on behalf of owner-occupiers it should not escape their notice that the number of houses built for owner occupation in the private sector—8,720—is 1,200 more than in 1967. I hope my hon. Friend the Minister of State will have regard to some of my remarks, which have been attenuated in accordance with the overall wish of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Steel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to give the Bill a very genuine and warm wlecome on behalf of my colleagues. In particular I want to speak as chairman of the new advisory council of the Shelter organisation which has been set up in Scotland. Mention was made of that organisation on Tuesday last and it might interest the Committee to know that in the autumn
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
last year the Shelter organisation decided to set up a separate organisation in Scotland and that an office has been opened in Edinburgh. I am chairman of its advisory committee which includes a number of people expert in this field, including Professor Cullingworth on whose Committee's Report the Bill is based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would say at the outset that I hope the Government might be agreeable to including in the Bill a specific reference to the power of local authorities to assist the work of housing associations. In the few months that Shelter has been active in Scotland we have exceeded the financial target that was set. The response in Scotland has been great, which is a reflection of the fact that people in Scotland are well aware of the critical situation with regard to older housing. We have been able already to add to the previous record which Shelter had of giving finance to housing associations in Glasgow and Edinburgh and even to a small scheme in Greenock. I am sure that the work Shelter does in harnessing the enthusiasm, particularly of young people, to this work is extremely valuable in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not believe my ears when I heard some remarks by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) on Tuesday last, and I waited to comment upon them until I had read the Official Report. He said in relation to local authority tenants:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that nothing does more to undermine the whole sense of value and moral fibre of an individual as an independent and enterprising being than living in a subsidised council house."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 18th March, 1969; c. 40.]</p></blockquote>
I must say that that was one of the most extraordinary statements I have every heard in this Committee and I would have thought if anything were likely to undermine moral fibre it would be the inheritance of a large and comfortable mansion house in a beautiful part of my constituency; but I do not believe it has undermined the hon. Gentleman's moral fibre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, yes, it has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Steel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But he should not make such remarks about those in less fortunate circumstances than he. It is a remark which will not soon be forgotten.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. G. D. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made somewhat similar remarks—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."]—which have been misunderstood, whether deliberately or otherwise I do not know, and I would say that what I believe my hon. Friend was saying was——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman can also make a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will if I get the opportunity to catch the eye of the Chair. What my hon. Friend was saying was that if one does not have the opportunity of providing a house for oneself one inevitably loses some sort of independence which goes with ownership.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Steel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would make two points in reply. I was quoting precisely what the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North, said on Tuesday, not an interpretation of it. Secondly, I am well aware of statements which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith), has made in the past, but I did not expect him to be joined in those by his hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the Bill is to lay down higher standards and further incentives for improving old property. This is extremely important, because we have to recognise that not only is there growing obsolescence amongst Scotland's older houses, but, concurrent with this, there is an increase in the standard which we or anybody else would consider acceptable in housing. If we look at the way in which the S.S.H.A. is undertaking a programme of rehabilitation and upgrading of houses built in the 1946–1955 period we see how much more important it is in comparison with that to lift the standards of houses of an older period. I imagine that in my own constituency ten years ago we could not have conceived the situation where in 1969 there could be a new local authority housing scheme making standard provision not only for a bathroom but for a downstairs cloakroom and second lavatory, and warm air central heating. The whole standard of housing is going up at the same time as we are facing the problem of obsolescence in older houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In looking at this Bill should we not be considering extending some of the items eligible for the standard grant? For
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
example, electric wiring is extremely important, and if we are to spend money on older houses, from the grants laid down earlier and now increased in amount by this Bill, there may be a case for adding a standard of electrical wiring to allow, for example, for a sufficient number of 13-amp points throughout a house. I would like these points looked at further at the Committee Stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a particular improvement I would like to see it is in Clause 1, because I believe there is still a need for subsection (3) to be considerably strengthened. It provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every local authority shall from time to time cause to be made such a survey or inspection of their district as may be necessary for the performance of the duty imposed on them by subsection (1) of this section or for the purpose of ascertaining the availability of alternative housing accommodation."</p></blockquote>
I would like a specific requirement, first, for all local authorities to produce such a survey by the end of 1972 and thereafter to produce one on a regular 10-yearly basis. This should be a particular responsibility on the local authority, and it should be required to put proposals for remedies, and not only the results of the survey, to the Secretary of State for Scotland and have them published. These provisions will require stiffening, and I hope that the Government will be sympathetic to this view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with interest to the arguments on finance which were raised on Tuesday on how to deal with the problem of the private landlord. It is true we shall have to seek a higher level of rents if landlords are to be able to improve their properties, but, equally, there are many instances, some of which I have come across in my own constituency, where no reasonable amount of rent increase, and no amount of depreciation tax allowance, such as was proposed by the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell), will be adequate to enable some private landlords to carry out the expensive repairs which need to be made to property. The whole system of having housing owned by a few and rented to many, a system which must have been based on the profit motive, is outdated and cannot be accepted as normality in our society today. Unfortunately, some people who have no adequate private means, sometimes quite poor people, may find themselves in the position of having inherited old property and are in difficulty in
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
improving it. In this situation we must accept a trend towards the municipalisation of some of these older properties where the private landlord is unable to pay for necessary improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may make a specific suggestion, might the Government not allow a higher level of private rent to be charged to a tenant and then allow the private tenant access to the local authority rent rebate scheme? I shall be interested to hear whether this possibility has been investigated by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the main housing black spots in Scotland are in the cities, there are disturbing features in the Scottish housing situation which tend to get ignored. The report 
	<i>Scotland's Older Houses</i> contains a table which shows that an area which has a larger percentage of houses sharing or lacking a fixed bath is not Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee or Aberdeen, but Galashiels. This highlights the fact that one can find a legacy of bad housing in some of the small towns in Scotland where perhaps local authority expertise and resources are not as great as those in the cities which are tackling the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not only true of the small burghs in Scotland, but is also true of the rural areas. Slums are no more attractive simply because they are placed in a rural setting. Some of the most tragic housing cases which I have had to deal with as a M.P. are not in towns but in country areas. It is difficult for a landward local authority to have an adequate house building programme and to provide houses where people want to live. I should like to see the Government introduce a scheme providing for mobile housing units, which would be of great help to local authorities which find themselves in these difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened to Recommendation No. 70 of the Cullingworth Report, which touched upon the problem of rural slums and said that the problem requires separate study? Has that study been carried out and, if so, what has happened to it? If nothing has yet been done about it, then why not? It is important that in dealing properly with the amount of bad housing which exists in our city centres, we should not forget the squalor which exists in some of the outwardly attractive areas of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0161">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Adam Hunter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this Bill, for it has tremendous possibilities, if not in the short term, certainly in the long term. Obviously, the problems vary from constituency to constituency. In my own constituency we do not face the problem of large tenements. Any which we possessed went some time ago because of the forward-looking policies of town councils and county councils which got rid of such properties years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly pleased to see that the Bill increases the limits for discretionary improvement grants, with the maximum grant to private owners going up from £500 to £1,200. Many owner-occupiers felt that the improvements brought about by the existing maximum were not sufficient to provide a useful long life to older property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed maximum is an added incentive for younger owner-occupiers who have recently, or a few years back, purchased a house of an older type without the requisite modern amenities. The improvements possible from the new grants will compel many to look towards renovating or modernising an older house rather than burden their lives for thirty years ahead with high mortgage rates for a completely new house or a comparatively recently built one with all the modern amenities. I also welcome the suggested raising of the maximum of the standard improvement grant. This will be received with gratitude by owners of property and also by owner-occupiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part I of the Bill introduces attractive criteria to decide if a house measures up to a tolerable standard. The requirements mentioned in the Bill are positive enough, but one with which I am currently concerned could lead to difficulties, namely that the literal meaning of the word "dampness" is not upheld. Who will decide if a house is substantially free from penetrating damp? It is hardly possible at present to define "freedom from dampness". The usual and ever-recurring explanation on complaints of dampness is that it is caused by condensation. Just two days ago it was reported in the 
	<i>Edinburgh Evening News</i> that the Depute City Architect for Housing in Edinburgh stated that it was a problem not only in new houses in Edinburgh but was a growing problem throughout Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Bill will do something positive to help two housing schemes in my constituency, both of which are under
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
the Scottish Special Housing Association. I refer to the schemes in Woodmill, Dunfermline, and the scheme in Rosyth, the former built in 1948 and the latter back in 1914. The Woodmill scheme has a chronic damp problem. Dampness, mould and wet walls are featured in the complaints from many tenants. The seriousness of the position for the tenants is that the houses may be there for another forty years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The S.S.H.A. at the moment, like some local authorities in other parts of Scotland, has no remedy. A few years ago, in the Woodmill scheme, the system of heating was changed from solid fuel to other forms of heating. The result was soaring heating costs, but the persistence of damp.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Rosyth scheme is well known to my hon. Friend the Minister of State. He and I have crossed swords on this matter on many occasions, and once or twice he has dropped his guard and been very generous. But he is beginning to see that the sword has a double-edged blade. Even after modernisation in the Rosyth scheme a number of houses which I have seen, two of them as recently as Sunday last, have the undoubted benefits of the improvements of modernisation detracted from due to dampness to a lesser or greater extent. I trust that the Bill will allow more money to be released to the S.S.H.A. to provide a fuller and much more satisfying modernisation programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper, Cmnd. 3598, contains a significant paragraph, namely, paragraph 8, which I should like to read to the Committee:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government consider that worthwhile results will be achieved only if the local housing authorities accept that they have an important role in their districts, not only as the providers of houses for letting, but also as the co-ordinators of all efforts directed to securing satisfactory housing for the whole community. There will be a role for housing associations, and much will depend on the co-operation of owners, factors and residents, but the local housing authorities must take the lead in driving the policy forward in each district. Legislation can give them better powers, better techniques and better financial arrangements. They alone can provide the drive without which all else will be of no avail."</p></blockquote>
That is a most important paragraph. I can see that in future local authorities will play the role of overlord in compelling all sorts of people—private owners, owner-occupiers and housing associations—to carry out repairs and improve their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0162">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
property. Despite what housing associations, owners or owner-occupiers think, will the local authority decide what is best for all concerned?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of compensation and the compulsory acquisition of houses. The Bill and the White Paper use different terms in this connection. On the one hand slum clearance is mentioned, and on the other "housing treatment areas". What has happened to town redevelopment schemes? Redevelopment in towns is taking place in areas at the moment and it can be phased. Redevelopment in towns can also absorb perfectly good older houses without modern amenities and others with every amenity. Redevelopment may require, and certainly will require in my area, compulsory purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to ask my hon. Friend what is the position of the owner in a redevelopment scheme when he finds his good house being taken over by compulsory purchase. Is he entitled to the additional payments embodied in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part IV deals with the fixing of fair rents. This provides for the conversion of existing controlled tenancies into regulated tenancies. The 1965 Act had this embodied in legislation. What will take place as a result of the Bill is simply the end of controlled tenancies in some cases and the introduction of regulated tenancies which had previously been deferred. Many people may have some objections to the latter course. However, where improvements have taken place, my hon. Friend's difficulties will not be as great. In the Rosyth modernisation scheme it is well known that as soon as a tenant returns to his house after modernisation he has to bear an increase in rent of £14 to £16 per year, and I understand that this is accepted without demure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with Part V in relation to environment, which interests me very much. The constituency point which I wish to raise does not go as wide as the point which was raised by my right hon. Friend in introducing the Bill. For environmental purposes, the amount of money is restricted to £100 per house, which, in some smaller schemes, is a great deal of money. I welcome this Part of the Bill for I can see a way in which it will assist with a problem in my area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in mind a controversy which is at present raging in Rosyth where long blocks of housing exist and where the end
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
tenants are being asked now, after many years, to extend facilities to the middle tenants to pass round the end houses for various domestic reasons. The environment facilities could be greatly improved by cutting a wider communal path in the garden space between two blocks of houses and by striking off a narrow path up to each individual back door. This would give every tenant his own entrance, improve the external amenities, and make for a much more harmonious community. I welcome the Bill and hope that it has a quick and smooth passage through the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate on Tuesday was as a breath of fresh air compared with what we sometimes have in housing debates. I am afraid that the Committee will need a good breath of fresh air, since before this Session is over we shall be suffering from severe legislative indigestion. We have already had major Bills on education and on town planning and now we have this large Bill on housing. It is much too much for one Session. The Secretary of State would have done better not to have driven this Committee and himself quite so hard. After all, quality is far more important than quantity. At the end of the day one hopes that when the Secretary of State is totting up the score he will not preen himself on the number of Bills which he has produced, but will, rather, concentrate on the extent to which they actually improve matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that in spite of its good intentions the Bill is not likely to achieve very much. Nevertheless, I welcome it, not so much because it is likely to be a great contribution to the improvement of housing but because it is an indication of one of the most wonderful changes of heart I have ever seen, which I hope may lead to the really radical changes which alone will cure the housing problem in Scotland. What does the Bill do? It is really quite extraordinary. It proposes that the wicked landlord shall get some more money!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is almost incredible to think of the change of heart on the benches opposite. The Minister need not get busy—I shall pay him plenty of compliments. My noble Friend said that the conversion of

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could hardly believe I was hearing aright when I heard the good sense that for once in a while issued from the lips of the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton). I can only assume that this change flows from the recognition of the fact pointed out by the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) that the landlord is in a way the underdog, and that the desire to put more money into his pocket flows from that tradition of helping the under-privileged which is so much a part of the history of the Labour Party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is quite right about the ideal of helping the underdog, the bottom dog. The problem for Government has always been how to help the bottom dog without helping a dirty dog.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good point. I would go all the way in agreeing with the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was talking about the Secretary of State perhaps having a little bit of a split mind, not having quite exorcised the old Adam. Or this may well be just his cunning, in order to get the Bill, which may not be all that agreeable to certain elements of the Labour Party, though obviously that does not apply to any Member of the Committee. How otherwise, if he has not a split mind, does he explain that—so far as I can make out, though I may have made a mistake in reading the Bill—the owner-occupier gets full compensation for compulsory acquisition, as he should, whereas the landlord merely gets site value? This seems an
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
unfair discrimination unworthy of the right hon. Gentleman in his new guise of being fair to everyone, and we shall want to examine this prejudice a little more fully in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But at this stage what we should be asking ourselves, and have been asking ourselves, is whether this Measure, which is intended to improve the existing stock of housing and so the whole housing situation in Scotland, will really work, or, like so many other housing Measures, be a dead letter. Here I accept my responsibility for not perhaps achieving at the time when I was a Minister as much as one should. The Secretary of State said that he had a lot of figures which he was prepared to throw at me. I refer to the former Secretary of State who said that this is really not like a game of tennis for bandying figures backwards and forwards, but an opportunity to try to improve matters. It does not matter which party does it. If the party opposite does it and does it better than we did, nobody will be more pleased than I.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have grave doubts whether the Bill will do all that the right hon. Gentleman hopes. My doubts are, first, on administrative grounds, and, second, because of the financial arrangements. It is easy enough for us, sitting in this pleasant, well-heated Room to say, "Let us modernise houses". But where are the extenants to go while this is being done? If one solves that problem of taking them out and putting them back again, what will happen to the tenants for whom there is no room. because of the modernisation? Who will house them? Unless there is some power to compel local authorities to co-operate with private people who wish to improve their property the administrative complexities may deter many small people from ever going ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember when I was at the Scottish Office being very impressed by a scheme carried out by Lithgow's, of which the Minister will be aware. I felt that it was the solution to the whole tenement problem. But Lithgow's is a multimillionaire landowner with vast resources behind the firm, and there was no reduction in the number of houses. The houses were improved, the people were able to return, and the local authority was fully co-operating. What grounds has the Minister for expecting that the small man will get the same sort of co-operation and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>65</span>
help from the local authority as Lithgow's, doing a very large scheme, could get? With good will and a good deal of drive from the Scottish Office, which I hope it will provide, I dare say the administrative difficulties may be partially overcome, but it will not be easy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the financial aspects? Here I have much graver and more fundamental doubts. Before a landlord will undertake all the work involved and the trouble associated with it he must know what sort of return he will get from his investment and when he will get it. He is not a philanthropist, but just an ordinary man looking after his savings. Could the Minister give some estimate of what the figures are likely to be? It was because of this that I interjected in the middle of the Secretary of State's speech, when he introduced the Bill, to say that it was not lack of willingness but lack of means that had deterred private landlords so much in the past, and unless this means aspect is put right there will not be the progress that there should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard it suggested—I do not know whether this is true—that the return may be as low as 3 per cent., and that the full 3 per cent may not materialise till seven years after the work has been done. Now perhaps I shall be making a political point, but it has been made so many times before that the Minister will not pay any attention to it. At a time when, because of the Government's incompetence, the Bank Rate is 8 per cent. and the mortgage rate is so high that many people can no longer afford it, a return of 3 per cent., after seven years, coupled with the tremendous difficulties of organising the whole operation, is not likely to attract the surge of work necessary if this house saving or improving operation is to be the success which everyone in the Committee wants it to be and which I believe it could be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This makes me think that we should inquire what has gone wrong with housing in Scotland in the past. Surely, the answer is, simply, not enough return on capital. It is not the wickedness of the landlord. The Secretary of State rightly referred to the appalling conditions and the housing evils which exist, but it is not the landlord who is responsible; it is the soft-heartedness of various Governments: in trying to protect the tenants they have prevented there being enough money available to keep the property in good repair or to make improvements worth
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
while. It is a case of getting out what one puts in, and nothing like enough has been put in over the past fifty years. Right up to 1914, private people were putting their savings, often in quite small amounts, into the provision of new housing to let, thus creating a socially useful asset. They did not create slums. They did not want to. Nobody would deliberately reduce the value of his own property. It was Government intervention that started it, and Government fear over the years that perpetuated it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can never understand the former attitude. It is clear from the support the Bill has had that this is no longer the attitude of hon. Members opposite, who apparently in the past thought that it was perfectly all right to provide bingo halls and things like that and charge what was necessary to make them operate efficiently, but that it was wrong to do the same for housing. I am glad to say that that is now an old attitude. I do not want to rub salt into the wounds, but this attitude, so long espoused by the party opposite, is responsible for slum conditions and makes the Bill necessary. It held back the Conservative Party from doing what I at least thought right when a Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State is always saying, "You did not do so well. You did not do half as well as we have done". This may well be true enough. The Minister may be right in saying that we had the power and could have done it. But he knows as well as I that one does not operate power in a vacuum. A great deal depends on the political climate. If the political climate in 1962 had been the same as it is today, the party opposite, when in Opposition, had had the same attitude towards the problem as it has now, we would have been able to make more progress. I do not want to make too much of this, but I do not want the Minister to waste time in saying that he has done better than we. I am very willing to accept that he may have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is that the policy which the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important point about all this is that we seem gradually, perhaps by different methods, to be coming round to the same aim. I am very glad that that should be so. Now that there seems to be no ideological difference between the two sides—[
	<i>Laughter</i>]—Surely that is so? I am very surprised at that reaction. Now that there seems to be no ideological difference——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Woodburn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since we are all cleansing our souls today and purging our past, does the hon. Gentleman agree that part of the trouble in Scotland is that this is the Lord punishing the Conservative Party for educating the people for over one hundred years that it is a sin to pay rates and a sin to pay rent, and that, therefore, he cannot expect the public to alter that attitude in Scotland after the maleducation for about one hundred years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that one could say that it was the Conservative Party that educated them like that. The ex-Minister, with his great knowledge of history, will know that in the nineteenth century one could bundle all the Tories into one railway carriage on the way down from Scotland. It was really a Liberal Administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in this sphere there now seems to be, if not no ideological difference, at least much less difference than there used to be between the two sides, what is wanted is an attack on the housing situation in Scotland on a slightly broader basis than the Bill provides. What I shall say now may not have the full agreement of hon. Members opposite, but I hope that they will accept it in the spirit in which I have been speaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first thing that would help a great deal would be to encourage a sitting tenant in a council house who is willing to buy that house to do so. This would provide money for the local authority to help in the job of repairing old houses, because it is here that finance is a limiting factor—for example, in the difficulties which are being experienced with regard to Erskine and Glasgow. Why should not this be in the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly—and to my mind this is a far more important and fundamental matter—if the Minister could introduce a little more of the law of supply and demand into the determination of rents, both for council
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
houses and for private houses, this would help a great deal. If the Secretary of State wants results, he must do something along those lines. I realise that the right hon. Gentleman is in great difficulties because the S.T.U.C. says that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Cheap housing is a basic human need."</p></blockquote>
If one says that, why not cheap clothes, and cheap everything? But if one does one gets into an impossible position. Once we allow the law of supply and demand to operate instead of subsidising council tenants who do not need subsidising at the expense of the ratepayers, and subsidising private tenants at the expense of private landlords, which inevitably produces slums and makes the Bill necessary, we shall be on the way to solving the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of the present system, we should subsidise people irrespective of the houses in which they live. Surely this would be good Socialism, and would appeal very much to the kind heart of the Minister, who told me the other day, "From each according to his ability, and to each according to his need"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, West, said that this problem of determining rents in a fairer way was one of the great hot potatoes of our time. I do not believe that. It is not a hot potato now, because this is something out of which we on this side of the Committee would not try to make any political capital. I am sorry to say that had we tried to do this seven years ago this harmonious state of affairs would not have existed. If this were done it would encourage the better off to leave what for them would be a highly rented council house and to provide privately for themselves, and so increase at no cost to the public the stock of houses in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here perhaps I shall be treading on thin ice, but I hope that I shall not be misunderstood. I am trying to interpret what my noble Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith), said about creating a sense of independence and responsibility. I believe that if someone is fortunate enough to be in a position to provide himself with a house of his own it inevitably gives him a sense of independence and a sense of responsibility. I wish it were possible to discuss this in a rational atmosphere, instead of having the hon. Gentleman over there looking at me as though I were a rabbit coming out of a hole, and he a ferret just waiting to pounce
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
on me—and have my words printed and circulated around the constituencies; we know what happens. But this is a great pity, because nobody is trying to run down council tenants. Many of them cannot provide houses for themselves, and it is right and proper to help them, but many others who, at the moment, are in council houses could, if matters were differently arranged, provide for themselves, as in Belgium—and my wife is a Belgian so I know quite a lot about that—and also in Australia, where people who were working-class people in this country and never dreamed of having a house of their own have [provided 'themselves with a house because it is the accepted thing to do, and they feel very much better as a result. One hon. Gentleman referred to the terrible vandalism which goes on, the destruction of the concrete outside a house, and the defacing of houses. I am certain that no parent would allow his children to do that if it were his own house. There is no doubt at all about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and quite as important, the higher rent which a private landlord would be able to get if there were a free operation of the law of supply and demand would enable existing houses to be properly maintained. This is as big a problem as improving houses. This is not a once and for all operation. Houses are improved, and in a few years more money has to be spent on them to keep them up to standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, it would encourage people to put their private savings into the socially useful provision of houses instead of into the building of bingo halls and things like that, because there would be a sure economic and viable return, as there used to be fifty to sixty years ago. This would be a highly desirable change. A permissive society is all very fine, but a purposive society such as I suggest would be very much better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alas, the Government have drawn back from this bold attack. They are like a horse going into a jump. The Minister does not live in a horsey district, but the Secretary of State does, and I dare say he attends all the race meetings at Ayr and knows how horses sometimes run away from a jump. The Government have drawn back from this bold attack. They have seen the light, but they have lacked the courage to go the whole hog.—[
	<i>Laughter.</i>] I am glad that hon. Gentlemen opposite are having a good time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
After all, these affairs are sometimes rather dreary. The Government have failed to observe the wise saying of the distinguished Scottish judge:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is necessary to will the means as well as willing the ends."</p></blockquote>
This is where the party opposite has made a mistake. Hon. Gentlemen opposite relish the vital statistics of Cullingworth, the evils of the housing situation, as the Secretary of State called them. But we must have all of Cullingworth, not just the vital statistics. We must, in particular, have Recommendation 23 which referred to a reasonable post-tax return. Till this is recognised, I do not think that any really significant progress will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that from a practical point of view the Bill will be a failure. It will not fulfil the hopes that are expected of it, but for the future it is a great psychological advance, and will pave the way for a more radical Measure by the next Government and next Scottish Administration headed by my hon. Friend. We shall be able to carry this new philosophy in the Bill to its logical conclusion, because the party opposite, having accepted the principle of adequate money going into houses, can hardly object if we implement what it has not quite got the courage to do now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Bill buries old quarrels, I believe that it is a very good Measure, though a half-hearted one. I urge the Secretary of State to stiffen the Bill, if he has the guts to do so, along the lines which I have suggested, so that it will achieve a little more than it is likely to do in its present form. If the right hon. Gentleman does that, he can be sure of 100 per cent. support from this side of the Committee, because it is not the landlords of Scotland about whom we are concerned but about housing and the houses of the people of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) appeared to be looking back with a certain amount of nostalgia.

Gentleman has been acting as a kind of peacemaker or mediator.

The noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) paid a tribute to the housing record of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
City of Edinburgh. Indeed, he mentioned the convener by name. I think that the noble Lord laid himself open to the charge of making a plug. I do not know whether it was an electioneering plug. There is no doubt that he wants to pursue that line, but I think that many people in Scotland will quarrel with his measurement of what constitutes a wonderful housing record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Edinburgh is to be praised, I think that the neighbouring constituency of Midlothian deserves even greater praise for its performance in the building of houses. Perhaps it should, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) has often said, be called the premier county of Scotland. If we want to praise housing conveners of councils, I do not know what sort of praise would be in order in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only yesterday the Master of Works, Mr. Anderson, was able to report a record figure for building of £17,817,519. In 1965 the value of the work approved was nearly £9.5 million. In 1966 it was about £5¼; million. In 1967 it was about £12¼ million. In 1968 it rose above £17¼ million, an increase of more than 40 per cent. What is germane to this discussion is that £13 million worth of work in 1968 was for new houses and garages for both local authority and private housing. It represented about 4,000 houses built in 1968. If the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North wants to pay tributes, I suggest that he should pay tribute to the county which I have the privilege to represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should remind my hon. Friend that Edinburgh's housing record is similar to that of the Tory Government's. It really is deplorable. The average since the war has been 1,200 houses per year, which is well below the targets set by Edinburgh Corporation for years and years. Some of the areas which have been cleared there should have been cleared fifty years ago. I remember being on a deputation to achieve that nearly forty years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against the background which I have illustrated, there has also been talk of rates. The record of my county is all the more distinguished for the fact that, with a rate of 18s. 3d. in the £, it is the thirteenth lowest of the 33 county authorities in Scotland from the rates point of view. This gives the lie to the belief that if an authority pursues a vigorous housing policy that must bump up the rates.

I take issue with the noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North, over his remarks about bankruptcies. He went out of his way to give the figures for England and Wales. I found it a bit surprising. I thought at the time that he intended to give the figures for Scotland, given in Answer to a Question I posed in the House.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
I thought I was entitled to draw to the Committee's attention the fact that the figures are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When introducing the Bill my right hon. friend was right to draw attention to the fact that we have achieved the best housing record since he was appointed. As my right hon. Friend pointed out, while there is no room for complacency it is a record of which to be proud. During his speech he complained about the number of interruptions. Quite frankly, I wish he had been interrupted more often, because it would have been even more embarrasing for hon. Gentlemen opposite, because, with each answer to each interruption, my right hon. Friend revealed the record of hon. Gentlemen opposite when they were in power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of private housing figured largely in the debate. My right hon. Friend might have told hon. Members that under Labour the country has built the highest number of private houses since 1934. I hope that the Minister of State will shed his modesty and speak of this achievement when he replies later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to landlords. While not all landlords are bad, they are not all good. Nor are they all owners of a small number of houses. I felt that at last Tuesday's Sitting a case was being unconsciously made by hon. Gentlemen opposite for different treatment to be meted out to small compared with large landlords. In my experience, the greatest injustices in housing have been perpetrated by the larger-scale landlords. I would not claim that one could have an iron formula about this, but I wonder if hon. Gentlemen opposite intend to move an Amendment in Committee to define the various categories of landlord? That seems to have been a thread in the debate and perhaps the hon. Gentleman, when he winds up, may wish to make some comment about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my most satisfying jobs in public life was that of housing convener of a county housing authority. I occupied that post for nine years. I was, therefore, interested to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton), refer to multistorey flats and the social consequences of them. I would not necessarily compliment a local authority which did not build multistorey houses, as long as ample lift facilities were provided. If one builds high one must provide these facilities or this type of
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
accommodation, particularly for the infirm and elderly, can be a sort of imprisonment. The noble Lord said at Tuesday's Sitting:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I believe that nothing does more to undermine the whole sense of value and moral fibre of an individual as an independent and enterprising being than living in a subsidised council house."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 18th March, 1969; c. 40.]</p></blockquote>
I found that offensive, and the noble Lord should not be surprised if people retaliate in an equally offensive manner. Some might say that it is the titled speaking to the entitled. I think that perhaps his party will be annoyed that he said that. It seemed that his hon. Friend the Member for Hillhead was trying to act as peacemaker. I do not know whether the noble Lord was trying to foment a class war or a class struggle—[Hon. Members: "Oh!"]—but I assure him that his remarks give rise to anger if nothing else because they were both offensive and unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing serves a social need and the whole community benefits. In our debate in the House yesterday I did not hear hon. Members refer to a subsidy being given when we were discussing the Price Review. Indeed, it would have been unfair of them to have made that remark because even to subsidise food is to do something valuable for the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I speak on behalf of my constituents. Thousands of them, in addition to thousands of people throughout the country, will never have the capital to buy their own homes because their wage-earning capacity is too low. Nevertheles, these people have already invested something far more important than capital. Some of them have invested their whole lives in industry and it is my belief that they are one of the country's greatest assets. They are more important than all the noble lords and all Members of Parliament strung together. When we talk about them we should do so with great humility—and I mean, all of us. Perhaps if we had done that there would not be the disillusionment with politicians, with Governments and so on. I can only say I deplore the kind of remark which the noble Lord made. I believe that he will regret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having contacted some of the burghs in my constituency about the Bill, I assure the Minister that they are unhappy because it does not enable them to deal with older local authority houses. Their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
case is that those older houses should be brought up to standard before they become time-worn dwellings. I am, of course, not speaking of slums. It seems that the Bill does not cover this aspect and I trust the Minister will look into this. They argue that houses of this kind require modernisation and that, as matters stand, there are complications in their housing allocation policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of issues remain to be discussed. I hope that I will be a Member of the Committee which examines the Bill and, if so, I will raise those other matters at that stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) talked of a conversion on the road to Damascus in respect of the Secretary of State and this Bill, and I think he went a little far, but in respect of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) his remarks were, if anything, an understatement. On reading in the OFFICIAL REPORT that hon. Gentleman's comments I could not help feeling that the attribution of these remarks to him must clearly have been a printer's mistake; because the contrast between the remarkable sense which he talked many times on Tuesday morning and what he has said on
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
so many occasions in the past has been so flagrant as to be almost unbelievable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view, to describe this Bill as a conversion on the road to Damascus is something of an overstatement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would extend to the Bill the kind of welcome one might extend to a Panama hat in a thunderstorm—it is better than nothing but not very much better than nothing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith) in his most valuable contribution when he said that it represented a change of climate; and if the party opposite, when it returns in due course to this side of the Committee, takes across with it some of the philosophy that lies behind this Bill, I believe with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead, that the next Conservative Government really will be able to make progress on our housing problems without having to face the appalling, controversial climate which any Conservative Government, trying to deal with these acute problems in Scotland, had to face in the past. We have only to ask ourselves what kind of reception the party opposite would have given to a Bill of this nature, or indeed to this very Bill, if it had been introduced by a Conservative Government. We have only to think of the cries that would have gone up about the largesse being distributed to landlords. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead, that that is not the kind of climate which makes it easy for any Government to deal with the problems of housing in Scotland in the way they need to be dealt with. If, therefore, this Bill does mark a change of heart, even a modest one, to that extent it is certainly welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) mentioned that some of the worst conditions were to be found not in the big cities but in small, landward areas and small burghs. He referred to Galashiels which, he rightly pointed out, has the highest proportion of households not sharing, or lacking, fixed baths. Arbroath, in my own constituency, shows the highest return in Scotland for the percentage of dwelling stock rated as unfit. It is only fair to say that that is a fairly subjective judgment. Anybody looking at the fifth column of figures on page 82 of the Cullingworth Report will see that it is clear that the return of unfit accommodation has been very much a subjective
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
judgment on the part of the local authorities themselves. That is inevitable. Nevertheless, both Arbroath and Port Glasgow have a depressingly high percentage of households without a fixed bath or water closet, as in the first two columns of figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, therefore, no dispute that this is a problem which affects all our constituencies. It certainly affects mine. I welcome the provisions contained in Clauses 18 to 23 in the Bill which may facilitate the clearance of housing that is incapable of improvement or modernisation, and I welcome in particular the provision for compensation for the owner-occupier who has to be moved out, so as to make good the difference between the site value and market value, although I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead that this should be extended, by the same context, to the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my mind, however, the kernel of the Bill is that part dealing with houses which are capable of renovation and improvement. I believe this is the most important aspect of the whole Bill, because for too long we have allowed houses in the private sector capable of improvement to deteriorate. If we can now reverse that process we shall be saving an enormous amount of housing which we cannot afford to lose. Unfortunately, I do not believe that the Bill as it is at present drafted is going to achieve much in that context. There have been many references to Recommendations 23 and 25 of the Cullingworth Report. They were quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell), but I do not believe that the Bill can be said to hold out the prospect of providing a reasonable rate of return for a private landlord who puts his accommodation into a reasonable state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First of all, the maximum grant, even with the increased provision in the Bill for improvements, still leaves the landlord to find half the total cost of improvement; and where is the money to come from? I have had instances, which I have referred to the Minister of State and his noble friend Lord Hughes, of constituents of mine with properties with controlled tenancies who are getting rents of £4 a year. I had one case of an old-age pensioner living on the ground floor of a tenement block. Up the stairs were two flats, one of which was owned by this
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
old lady. She got a rent of £4 a year. On the other side was an identical flat which was let at £4 a week. How is a landlord getting a rent of £4 a year to find the resources to modernise property in the way outlined in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could my hon. Friend say whether that rent of £4 was a regulated rent or some other kind of rent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not the precise details but I believe the flat let at £4 a week was a furnished rent. Nevertheless, the contrast is sufficiently striking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had dozens of these cases of controlled rents ranging from £4 to £15 or £20 a year which I have referred to the noble Lord, Lord Hughes, the Minister of State; and I have found by experience, in opening the replies, that I have to put a bucket underneath to catch the crocodile tears which come pouring from the paper. But it will take more than crocodile tears to enable landlords like these to take advantage of the provisions in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They have to find 50 per cent. of the cost of improvement. How are they to do it? They have to pay 8, 9 or 10 per cent. if they can raise the money; and where they are to raise the money from is a mystery to me. Even if they can do so, what kind of return are they going to get? My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead, referred to figures suggesting that the return might be as low as 3 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to quote from representations which many hon. Members will have received from the National Federation of Property Owners and Factors of Scotland and I would like to hear the comments of the Minister of State on this. The Federation says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Federation … fears that on the basis of the limit of the new improvement grants and the amount of capital required to be expended by private owners in relation to the rents to be fixed by Rent Officers the owner will not receive a reasonable return on the capital invested. The Federation knows of cases where this may be as low as 2 to 3 per cent."</p></blockquote>
We had an Answer in the House which showed that, after allowing for the standard rate of tax and the current rate of inflation—and, of course, the kind of landlord I am talking about is not paying the standard rate of tax—a real return of 12 per cent. would be needed to produce a net return of 3 per cent. If the Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
of State doubts those figures he should look up what was said by the Financial Secretary to the Treasury in reply. The return would be 2 or 3 per cent.; if the real rate of return to the landlord under the terms of the Bill is likely to be anything like that it will be a negative return. It cannot be anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is going to be years before there is any prospect of even this modest return being received. Under Clause 51 of the Bill, in the case of accommodation which is already up to standard, the landlord may have to wait till January, 1972, at the latest before he can even get a qualification certificate; and under Schedule 4 he may have to wait four years before he can begin to draw the full rate to which he will then be entitled. If it is a property which requires improvement there is still a delay of up to five years before the full regulated rent might be payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not enough for the Secretary of State to justify this by reference to the pressure on the rent officers. As I understand it, there are in all about 15,000 properties which might at the present time qualify for a regulated rent without further improvement. I am bound to say that in my experience I do not think many of them are in my constituency, but I find it hard to believe that this is a problem that really needs seven or eight years to solve. It is clear that the basic reason is the problem of facing the tenant with a sudden and very substantial increase in the rent he is required to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come here to the crux of the situation, because several hon. Members have pointed out that very often the tenant of privately rented accommodation may have a much lower income than the tenant of a council house. We have to recognise that there might be hardship in certain cases if the rent were automatically adjusted overnight, more or less to a regulated rent, but, on the other hand, it is recognised, and the Government at long last recognise, that unless the private landlord is allowed a reasonable return on his capital investment, a return, I would submit, far above what this Bill appears to offer, there is no hope of getting the renovation of our housing stock and the expansion of houses to let that is so badly needed in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To my mind, therefore, we come here to the real crux of the problem: how are we to deal with the situation where a
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
higher rent is needed which the tenant, because of the nature of his own resources, cannot be expected to meet? It is quite clear that we have to move away from the existing system of subsidies on the housing to subsidies on the individual. Only in this way can we eliminate the disparity at present existing between the public and privately owned sectors of rented accommodation under which the council tenant has a rent rebate and the private tenant has nothing of the kind. The subsidy should be on the individual and not on the house or on any other facility. That is how we should be moving. Only when we move in that direction shall we be able to divert into the housing programme of Scotland the resources that we must have if we are to solve this very acute problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the time factor I shall concentrate on one part of the Bill, Clause 58, which would enable local authorities to create play spaces for children. My hon. Friend will already have guessed the tenor of my remarks, because with his assistance, which was very helpful, I have for a long while been engaged in a struggle with the Corporation of Glasgow on this particular subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The irony of Clause 58 is that, at the very moment when we are discussing a Bill which seeks to provide more houses, we are at the same time wiping out, in the part of Glasgow in which I live, the open spaces for children which are proposed to be created by this Bill. I agree that this to some extent arises out of the necessity for more housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In facing up to this problem Glasgow Corporation has played a wonderful role. I see the result of its work in the part of Glasgow where I live, and also in the part of Glasgow which I have the honour to represent, the Parliamentary division of Govan. We have in Govan some of the oldest properties in Scotland; dwellings which have stood so long and become so weary in so doing that they have just "sat down". In one case a property decided to "sit" at a time of day when the women who lived in the property, at Kinning Park, were out shopping, the men at work and the children at school. Had that event not occurred at that part of the day, there would probably have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
been one of the greatest tragedies of all time when that property collapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On another occasion I was called to see a dwelling in which, during the course of an evening, the whole side fell out. The three children sleeping in the house duly wakened to find an uninterrupted view of the Clyde and the shipping moving along its sides. That sort of thing has been happening and is an indication of the problem which Glasgow Corporation had to face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with that problem it has used the multistorey method of building. Although I have criticisms of multistorey flats, I agree that in solving Glasgow's problem the multistorey flat is essential. We have them in Govan and they have made a wonderful contribution to building the new Govan. But in my view the multistorey flat is an instrument of solution to be used only at ground level; it is not for use on heights. To place, as the Corporation of Glasgow proposes to do, on the hill at Mansewood above Pollokshaws some 300 feet high, a series of multistorey blocks was a social crime and it created opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood the scheme the flats were to be twelve or thirteen storeys high. They may have been of help in meeting the problem in numerical terms, but a series of multistorey flats at such a height in the southern part of Glasgow was an injustice to the people who live in that area and in Glasgow itself. The wind from the southwest, which can be regarded as Glasgow's cleansing wind, would be impeded by these flats, would be lifted up and pass over a great part of the city. Further, it would have meant that for a period of at least two hours the setting sun's rays would not have fallen on a large part of the southern side of Glasgow. These are some of the reasons for which I and others oppose that particular proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, this was the solitary playing place that was left in that part of the city for the children in the area, and it was proposed to consume it in the scheme proposed by the Corporation. I felt that this was wrong since, if children are to grow up properly they must have space in which to play. This was their playground and it was going to be absorbed. Where is space for children proposed to be created in that part of the City of Glasgow? A struggle developed between the Corporation and myself and others, and my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
Friend was of great help to the ratepayers in that part of the city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my hon. Friend in his reply able to tell the Committee what limit in height has been imposed upon that housing development? Can he also give us some idea of the cost, which is an important factor? There are rumours that because of the immense amount of development work involved in the choice of site—almost four years have passed since it started and it is only now that the houses are beginning to emerge—cost has piled up as the years have elapsed. One must take into account the costs involved in the probings which lasted for the best part of a year in order to find a satisfactory base on which to place the houses. There was also the enormous task of making roads on the hill for use by people occupying the flats. All these factors have added up to a price for each house of between £6,000 and £7,000. This is a serious aspect of this development, apart from the other aspects which I have dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would emphasise the fact that if children are not to have recognised safe play spaces then they will use the streets where cars often speed at 60 miles an hour, in direct violation of the regulations. Yet that is now the playground of children in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I was in Glasgow on Saturday last I looked at some of the adjacent new housing areas in this part of Glasgow. I went to one which is still in process of construction. In parts it is at this moment as near to a slum as anything I have ever seen in the city. Most of the people living there have come from slum areas in Glasgow. Unfortunately this new development abuts one which was made before 1945. The contrast in appearance between the two and their quality is so marked as to be unbelievable unless one sees it. The property which was built over twenty years ago is better in every sense—better in structure, in positioning, and in all the qualities that accompany good houses—compared with the property adjacent to it which is still being erected by Glasgow Corporation. The new development is fouled by decorative abuses, and the stream which flows through the area is choked up with almost every conceivable bit of machinery one could imagine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In creating these costly new developments could we not at the same time see that somebody is appointed to maintain
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
the property as near as possible in the state in which it was when finally completed? The desecration which now occurs is quite shocking. It becomes more noticeable when it takes place near another group of dwellings which have been standing for twenty years, which have been better cared for and which are in a better state of repair than the new development still in process of creation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Children living in it use the streets for play, instead of the public park which is open to them. I feel that guidance should be given about utilities. The children might never have known a public park, so the provision is ignored and they still play on the streets. Therefore, the social aspect of housing should be kept under constant review and persons properly trained for the job of guiding young people in these areas should be part and parcel of the equipment of the new estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust you are not getting too impatient, Mr. Robertson. Perhaps I am talking too long. But not for me. I have sat here for two days to enter the debate. I hope that in occupying 10 minutes my speech is not becoming intolerable, because I have a lot more to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with particular cases, but I have not dealt with the general case. My general case, after I have listened to the continuing attacks from hon. Members opposite, is that a Labour Government only really got down to the problem of re-housing for the first time in 1945, when they had the majority they needed. [In wenty years they have done more to create a better and healthier Scotland from the housing point of view than the Tories did in the hundred years in which they had the problem to solve and failed. [An hon. Member "What about the Liberals?"] The Tories made Labour's task even greater. There might at least have been a word of encouragement and thanks today from the Opposition on the job the Labour Government have done in helping to solve the housing problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the great features of the debate has been the wide amount of agreement between Members on both sides. I am sure that you sometimes found this rather awkward in your position as Chairman, Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
Robertson. From your previous record in the Committee, I can imagine that there must have been times today, with compliments going backwards and forwards from one side to the other, when you were itching to get in and mix it up a little in your own style, as you have in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we may have had a fairly quiet debate, in view of some of the specific points raised I am sure that we shall have plenty of controversy in Committee on a great number of matters. At the same time, I repeat what my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) said in opening, that the improvements we shall put forward will be constructive, and we shall do our best to make sure that when the Bill leaves the Committee it is much better than it is now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all this atmosphere of peace and quiet, with just one or two interruptions, I ate to introduce any note of discord, but I know that the Minister of State is always very good at stirring matters up towards the end of the debate, and it is rather a pity to let things pass too easily. What I have to say now follows on from what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), said in trying to praise the record of his Government and party. None of us has failed to notice the window-dressing operation which has been going on on the Government side in the past ten days. Questions of a very similar nature have been asked seeking information of one sort or another, and I cannot help reflecting on what the purpose is. Are these the last gasps from a dying Government? Or are we perhaps—and this may be it—witnessing the sudden dawning of the moment of truth upon hon. Members opposite that their record is not all that good, and that they must do a bit of window dressing to make it look as if it is worth something?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain points have not escaped my notice. I am sure that others have also noticed that in almost every case Ministers in reply use money figures, conveniently forgetting that the value of the £ has dropped by 2s. l0. in the four years of Labour Government, and that in those four years we have seen an increase of taxation of over £2,000 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will answer that. We welcome the housing record. So we should, in relation to the money taken from us as private individuals. If more money had not been spent we as taxpayers would have every right to ask where the money was going. We only wish that the record were as good in other sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish Ministers had given more figures in physical rather than money terms, particularly in relation to the numbers of school places or jobs in Scotland. Then we might have had a more realistic picture. But I shall not pursue this point further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is that despite a great deal of good in the Bill—this point was robustly made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith)—it may be just another window dressing operation. I hope that it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We admire the Secretary of State's optimism, and that of the Minister of State. but we hope that they will keep their feet on the ground. The Secretary of State said nothing to minimise the problem we face. But from some of the speeches on both sides I wonder whether we are fully aware of the enormity of the problem we are trying to tackle. The Cullingworth Report, which is the basis of the Bill, recommended that over 300,000 houses in Scotland should be replaced, and that over 200,000 houses must be improved. That is a total of more than half a million houses, nearly a third of the total stock of houses in Scotland. If we are to tackle the problem over a period of 10 years, as Cullingworth suggests, we must try to reach a rate of 30,000 houses a year replaced and 20,000 houses a year improved. This brings our feet back on to the ground, and we see the enormity of the problem. However much hon. Members opposite may praise the Government's record, the target is way ahead of what we have achieved in the past. In many ways the problem fills us with awe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of demolitions was mentioned by the hon. Member for Fife, West
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
(Mr. William Hamilton). We are glad that the trend of demolition is rising, but will it be enough if we are to reach the Cullingworth target of 27,000 houses a year demolished? The hon. Gentleman gave great praise to the Government for the 19,000 houses demolished in 1967. We do not have the full figures for 1968 yet. We welcome that total, but let the hon. Gentleman also remember, when he speaks of the improvement since 1964, that when we came to power in 1951 no houses were being demolished. We raised this to over 14,000 in 1964. So in percentage terms we also have a very good record. This puts in perspective the Labour record that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan, was trying to defend. There was nothing to defend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also remember that in addition to the size of the problem there is its continuity. It will be with us for a very long time. It is not just a problem which affects the older houses in the older parts of our towns and cities. It also affects some of our older council houses which were built much more recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel), said, there is also the problem of housing standards rising. This is very important. We have seen that some things which households never dreamed of having ten years ago they now want. Two examples are central heating and double glazing, which is coming in considerably in certain areas. This demonstrates that the problem will always be with us and will always grow. The longer we delay tackling it the bigger it will become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State remembers that we cannot deal with the problem with a once and for all blitz. We must show determination and follow it through. I hope that everyone in the Committee agrees that we should treat the Bill as being only a start. The measure of its success will not be in its passing but the way in which we manage to carry it out and follow it through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst we all appreciate the great size of the problem and the long time-scale over which we shall have to deal with it, the real question we come down to is whether we have the resources to tackle it. All of us would like to know in financial terms how the Minister will fit in dealing with the problem of demolition and the programme of housing improvements with the new house building programme. At
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
any time there is only a certain amount or money available for housing needs as well as for other needs. What weight within the housing programme will be given to house improvement and demolition in relation to new housing? We have heard from the benches opposite of a target of 50,000 new houses a year, and we know that it has not been reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1970.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. But the prospects are not very bright for reaching it. It may have to be toned down a little if we are to do more of these improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's faults is that they are too prepared to tell the public that they will put some wonderful pie in the sky and will achieve wonderful targets, but, after raising people's hopes, at the end of the day they do not meet them. This has caused a great deal of disappointment and disillusionment. I hope that the Minister will learn the lesson from this and not raise people's hopes too much only to dash them. We want to hear realistically how the programme of improvement is to fit in with the target for new house building.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important question is whether we shall have the physical resources to deal with the problem. A very straightforward question raised in many speeches, particularly by my hon. Friends the Members for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) and Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith), is whether we have the resources in terms of labour and the type of firm needed to carry out this kind of improvement. In many cases, a different type of firm carries out such improvement work, as compared with the work in our new housing schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great difficulties are raised in relation to quotations. It is difficult for many firms to give realistic quotations for working on old property. I know this from personal experience. If a lot of new work is available firms will not quote for repair and improvement work, because it is easy for them to burn their fingers in taking on that work. I hope that this is borne in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
I hope, too, that when we come to discuss the question of repairing tenements consideration will be given to co-ordinating the work between local authorities, owner-occupiers and landlords, because if a whole tenement, or a whole area of property, can be renovated and improved at one time through a consortium of these different interests it is much more likely that the bigger firms will quote for this work than if we try to leave the work to the smaller firms. As the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Wood-burn) said, this is a real practical problem, and I hope that it will be tackled in a practical way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will tell us his experience of dealing with storm damage, because this is an analogous type of problem. It does not cover the breadth of labour trades that one gets in a general improvement scheme, but dealing with storm damage will have given the Minister some indication of how this problem can be tackled in practical terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to possibly one of the most encouraging features of the debate, and this is the responsible attitude which has been shown towards this whole question of rents. I think that the tone of the discussion was very much set by the hon. Member for Fife, West. It is quite clear that we cannot possibly solve the problem of older houses unless we enlist the help of, and give assistance to. the owners of rented property. It is essential that we get proper rents. As my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn said in opening the debate, if we do not get proper rents, there will not be the cash available for landlords to carry out the improvements which we all want to see. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) showed this very graphically in the example that he gave from his constituency of what a disincentive this is to a landlord to improve his property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also remember, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead said, that no landlord willingly allows his property to depreciate. This is an important point, and it cannot be made too often. A landlord has an asset, and nobody who owns something, be it a motor car or a house, will willingly allow that asset to depreciate. Therefore, as the Secretary of State said on Tuesday, while there may be some landlords who are willing to improve their properties,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0176">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
we have to be certain that we provide them with the means and the financial help to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Fife, West spoke about progress in other countries, and quoted international comparisons from 
	<i>Barclays Bank Review</i> on the progress in co-operative housing and co-ownership. One of the tragedies in Scotland is that this type of development has not gone on faster than it might have done. We all realise, too, that this is linked with the rent structure of local authority housing. The Report of the Housing Corporation refers to a
	<br><blockquote><p>"modest but steady year of progress in Scotland" compared with its work in England and Wales. I think we realise that in co-ownership and in cost-rent letting there is great scope for improving ourhousing stock.</p></blockquote>
I have two comments to make on the question of rents. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn said, we must look at this not only from the point of view of the actual rent but also from the point of view of the post-tax return which a landlord receives from improving his property. I reaffirm what my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus said, that this must be tackled through the Treasury, which must allow landlords a proper depreciation allowance on improvements which they carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second thing that we have to do—and we shall return to this in Committee—is to speed up the procedures by which a landlord can apply for a qualification certificate. We must speed the procedures not only in relation to property which is to be improved, but also in relation to property which has already been improved. It may be necessary to delay the certificates taking effect till 1971–72, but landlords ought to be able to apply straightaway and take their place in the queue of applications before rent officers. They must know what improvements in level of rent they will receive, and tenants given notice of the rents they will be expected to pay. This will give more realism to the situation than exists now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we must be clear about exactly what the Bill is trying to do. I think that we have to strip it to its bare essentials. On the one hand, we are trying to remove obstacles which prevent owner-occupiers and, in particular, landlords, from improving their houses. On the other hand, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles said,
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
we must try to assist tenants in hardship. There is no doubt that many people living in the older type rented properties are on lower income levels, and that they very often find themselves in financial difficulties of one kind or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sad fact is that these twin aims of the Bill are in conflict. I implore the Minister not to allow them to conflict. If he tries to compromise between those two aims he will get the worst of both worlds. The Minister must tackle both problems. He must make sure that landlords get fair rents so that they can carry out the necessary improvements. Secondly, he must tackle more realistically the problem of the less well off tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that we all wish the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles well in his work with Shelter in Scotland. I agree with him when he says that we must tackle the problem on the basis of the family, and not necessarily on the basis of the house. I therefore ask the Minister whether, in the interest of equity, we can extend the rent rebate scheme from local authority tenants only to private tenants as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is good, but I must ask the Government whether they are thoroughly convinced that they mean to carry it through. We admire the vigour of the Minister of State in dealing with these matters, but I should like to leave him with a quotation from paragraph 281 of the Cullingworth Report, which I think should be the motto of the Minister of State because I think that this applies very much to his efforts in Scotland:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No amount of exhortation or the publicising of targets can provide a substitute to a rational financial basis."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will keep those words before him, not only while the Bill is going through the House, but after it becomes law and he is trying to carry out its provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are living in a time of economic crises, of rising costs, and of soaring interest rates. Are the Government really prepared to provide the cash which is needed for this job? Are they prepared to make sure that local authorities carry out the provisions of the Bill? Are they equally prepared to provide the means for the private sector to play its vital and essential part in achieving our aims?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

(Mr. Buchanan-Smith) on his speech, and particularly on his admonition to us for the future. I have no doubt that many of the points he made will be discussed 
	<i>in extenso</i> in Committee, but I cannot go with him—nor with some other hon. Gentlemen opposite—when he defines the principal purposes of the Bill. The principal purpose of the Bill, as distinct from the English Measure, is to clear away slums faster than we have ever done before. That is the first thing. Its object is not to keep going many old houses which ought not to be left standing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important Cullingworth recommendation—and I emphasise this—is No. 2, which gives the kind of figures which the hon. Gentleman recited, though I did not understand his differentiation between 27,000 and 30,000. Cullingworth was talking about a period of ten years. The important thing is that Cullingworth—and when I say Cullingworth I refer not only to the distinguished academic but to his Sub-Committee, with which I worked closely when I was Chairman of the Advisory Committee, which we set up after the Tories abandoned it in 1951, and which has done splendid work—set targets, and this Bill is the first fruit of Cullingworth's endeavours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Cullingworth thought that within ten years 300,000 houses ought to be, not improved, but cleared away. When one looks at the figures and realises the number of years that have gone by, one realises how regrettable it is that we bumped along at such a low average in relation to slum clearance. To be fair to the party opposite, in 1955, taking the best figure that I can find for that party's benefit, the figure was about 12,000. In the last full year of their tenure of office it was 12,058, although for part of 1964 they managed to get it higher than that. We are up to 19,000, and we are still not satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a measure of the Bill. It is a definite attempt by the Government, in conjunction with local authorities, to step up the slum clearance rate. And that means new houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce-Gardyne</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And that is when?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So I take the point made by the hon. Gentleman that this has to be looked at in the context of the demand on our resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
We are spending about £120 million a year. I am sorry to quote money figures, but it was a money question. The number of houses built last year was 42,000 less eleven. The year before that the figure was 41,400. Those are both pretty good figures, and I do not think that we would have achieved them if we had not had housing targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A slum clearance target of 30,000 is the Cullingworth target. Despite what he said, he is not against targets. Targets are aims. The party opposite criticise us if we do not reach them, but if we do they forget all about those targets and look at the next ones. It is still our determination to get up to 50,000 new houses in Scotland a year—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Eadie) that last year's figure for the building of private enterprise housing was the best in the last thirty-four years. That is a pretty good record for this Government, particularly as we are often accused of being opposed to home ownership. That is a slander on this party which, from its inception, has believed in the right of an individual to own his property, and not to be exploited by anybody else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Land Commission has done a good job in extracting land from reluctant builders who were holding it back. The Commission has brought forward large sections of land by speeding up the procedures. Had it not been for the Commission's activities, this land would have taken much longer to get. The hon. Gentleman asked me to speed up procedures, and here we have done that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite give the impression that there is a great conversion on this side to this kind of Bill, and to the improvement of houses. The Hon. Gentleman succeeded the late Dick Brooman-White, whom we all liked. In 1964, in the United Kingdom Committee, only three Members on the Scottish Labour side were able to get on that Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one can forget my right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have studied the proceedings and it is clear that Labour hon. Members made an admirable case. When we debate this Measure it will be with about half of the Scottish hon. Members present and they will be able to debate it not confined and cribbed in a United Kingdom Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former Act was, if anything, bad in terms of how it turned out in operation. Once that Act was passed the number of houses improved under it was less than 90. There were 20 in that fine little Burgh of Lochgelly, which worked hard and got landlords to agree to improve those 20 houses, and the hon. Member for Dumfries (Mr. Munro) will be glad to know that the other 70 were in Dumfries. I assure him that the people of his constituency are anxious to get the Bill so that they can get on with the rest of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another 45 houses will be dealt with under these much better provisions. The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. Gordon Campbell) had better not scold us about our Measure not being well thought out because he will appreciate that the earlier Act was not a good one. We want local authorities to know that we are trying hard to improve the processes for the clearance and improvement of houses in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of attaching subsidies to persons is a wide issue and we can go into that matter in greater detail following the publication of the Report of the Prices and Incomes Board. In view of that, hon. Members will not expect me to comment further on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that hon. Gentlemen opposite wish to improve the Bill in a constructive way. I have always worked amicably in Committee with the hon. Member for Moray and Nairn. Occasionally he has become bad tempered and fallen out with me, but usually we have managed to get a good Bill. I am sure that hon. Gentlemen opposite are sincere in saying that they seek to improve the Bill in a constructive manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
I wish to encourage local authorities and others who wish to improve the Bill to let the Government, as well as hon. Members, know their proposals. For example, I regret that the Federation of Property Owners did not make its representations direct to the Government. I do not believe that any of my hon. Friends have received copies of its submissions, and it seems that they were sent only to hon. Gentlemen opposite. The Federation should have supplied all hon. Members with copies, and that goes for any representations which people may wish to put before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin), about Hill Park, I shall write to him on the subject because circumstances have changed and he will not expect me today to go into the matter in detail. I assure him that we appreciate the general point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the number of houses that will come within the regulations, this is another matter which we can deal with in depth in Committee, because I do not feel that the figure given by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) was correct. It is probably double that; but I will not deal with that subject now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that some of my hon. Friends raised the question of not just the improvement of private houses but also the improvement of council houses. Local authorities already have power to improve houses, whether or not they are subsidised. I have been at great pains, as has my noble Friend the Under-Secretary, to get local authorities to carry on with their schemes of improving a variety of older houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly with housing associations, there is no need to make special reference to them in Part III because the 1968 Act already contains full powers for local authorities to assist housing associations. This is a matter in which I should declare an interest in in that I am keen that we should push ahead with housing associations, although I would not accept the criticisms of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns about rents. This is a matter of organisation and dedication to the principle of co-ownership and cost-rent schemes. When in Opposition, the Labour Party welcomed the relevant Section of the 1954 Act, and nobody can say that, in Government, the Labour Party
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
has not tried hard to develop these schemes in Scotland. The English have done rather better than the Scots in this connection, largely because, as individuals, they have pushed ahead harder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Adam Hunter) referred to the question of compensation for landlords, which reveals how fair my hon. Friends are in debating this subject. Unlike the party opposite, we are providing in the Bill—we were reminded of this in yesterday's debate in the House—for owner-occupiers who suffer hardship to get proper compensation. Clause 20 applies Section 18 of the 1967 Act whereby, for example, young couples who have entered into hire purchase arrangements for buying their homes and who then have them taken away for demolition purposes will not necessarily be left having to pay what they owed on their homes. The Government have arranged matters so that the courts can arbitrate on how much of the remaining debt should be repaid or whether it should be completely extinguished. We are, therefore, anxious to encourage compensation to be paid and for adequate arrangements for compensation to exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the return which a landlord should get for improving property is a matter for the rent officer and, on appeal, for the rent assessment committee. A sorry state of affairs existed when the party opposite was in power, because although it speaks in a doctrinaire way about rents, it should be remembered that it set the landlord free above £40 rateable value in 1957 but did not have the political guts to take its doctrine the full stage and set everybody concerned free. It did not have any transitional arrangements, apart from creeping decontrol. We, on the other hand, have made an attempt to get a fair system between the landlord and tenant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not accept the analogies of the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns or the argument of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galbraith). I was grateful for the hon. Gentleman's speech. It was statesmanlike, although there were bits of the old Adam in it; he cannot help that because his conversion is not complete. The road to Damascus stretches a long way ahead for the hon. Member for Hillhead—but I appreciate his remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
I was asked about the acquisition of a good house as opposed to a substandard or slum type of property under a redevelopment scheme, but I suggest that we can discuss this matter further in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead reflected a speech made by his hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Wright), at the Glasgow Property Owners and Factors Association—if ever a speech was tailored for the purpose, it was that one—in which he argued the case for what he called a reasonable return on rents. The hon. Member for South Angus referred us to Recommendation 23 of Cullingworth. He also referred to the existence of Recommendation 24. I would like them read together, because one without the other does not make Cullingworth sense. We have provided in Part IV for paragraph 173 in Cullingworth, and also for Recommendation 24.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen (Mr. Gregor Mackenzie) raised the question of improvement costs. I agree that this matter has been the subject of much debate. We conducted a survey to determine a typical sample of Clydeside tenants. That showed that the incidental repair costs arising from limited improvements of the kind we are envisaging under the Bill should not be as great as is commonly supposed. We reckon it to be about £150 for each improved house. The Scottish Development Department is anxious to associate itself with pilot improvement schemes which will begin under the Bill to see whether or not things are working out in a desirable way and to see whether, not only in terms of finance but in terms of technique, we are on the right lines. It is not a question of laying down the law. For this reason I do not want things to be specifically laid down in the Bill. I prefer to arrange matters by regulations, which can be atered if we find, as a result of experience, that alterations are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this is a sad commentary on the fact that for so long so little was done about housing in Scotland, not only in terms of the need established by Cullingworth but in terms of how we should go about tackling the problem of meeting that need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman is right to use the figure of £150, although I have been unable to find a reference to the 12½ per cent. He said that my right hon.

I have taken the point that has been made about storm damage. We have learned a great deal about the organisation involved in what is a highly fractionalised industry. At one stage in Glasgow we found that we had more contractors than workmen. That is not untypical of the construction industry over the country as a whole. It is one of the most divisive industries possible. At one stage in the storm damage discussion we were given a figure twice the true one because people were double counting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was nothing mercenary involved in it, and they were genuine in giving their figures. It was simply a question of workmen being counted twice because they were also working for other contractors. As I say, we have learned a great deal about co-
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
ordinating the work of small firms and about the need for a steady flow of work. We have put this matter to some of the larger authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my right hon. Friend the Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Wood-burn) that we are conscious of the need to see that operations of this kind are organised in a proper way. We are now retraining about 10,000 workers a year in Scotland—not as many as we would like—and some of them are learning these skills. We will have a great need for their services in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn raised the question of the satisfactory standard. There is a misunderstanding here, but I would prefer to go into the matter later. We are not now debating discretionary grants and so on, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we intend to raise the standard. It will not be firmly fixed, and I trust that he agrees with us about the need to improve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point was raised—the misunderstanding between the chief sanitary inspector for Edinburgh and ourselves. His memorandum is a good example of a useful document and I would like to look in detail into some of the suggestions made in it. I assure the Committee that we do not regard ourselves as the repository of all knowledge and wisdom, and that we are anxious to accept any suggestions which we consider to be useful. However, I think that there is a misunderstanding about the point of the tolerable standard, and I will willingly debate this matter when we discuss the relevant parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 2 the Secretary of State has power, subject to the Affirmative Resolution procedure, to vary the standard in relation to any district or part of a district of a local authority. Thus, if there were general regulations, they could be different for different parts of the country—for example if it turned out that Edinburgh were in a singularly advantageous position and would not, therefore, benefit under the Bill. I willingly give the noble Lord the Member for Edinburgh, North (Earl of Dalkeith) that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill can be summarised in three ways. First, it is intended to clear houses faster than ever before and to get rid of slums. Secondly, it is intended to improve houses which are tolerable and which can be used for the next ten to twenty years, as Cullingworth said. Eventually they will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
be swept away, but it is intended to improve them in the intervening period. Thirdly, it is intended to be fair to those concerned in the intervening period so that we can get on with the better housing of the people of Scotland.
