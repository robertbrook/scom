	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee do meet again this day at Four o'clock.—[
	<i>Mr. Redwood.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. John Redwood)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the implications of the Budget for Wales.</p></blockquote>
Yesterday we saw a virtuoso performance from my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor. This year's Budget is a great Budget for the United Kingdom and a great Budget for Wales. It is a Budget for jobs, a Budget for economic recovery and a Budget to curb the deficit. [Hon. Members: "Whose jobs?"] Opposition Members do not understand the essence of the Budget; they do not want to believe that the recovery will grow stronger and continue year after year as the economic forecast suggests. I must disappoint them: the recovery will do that, and that will mean that the next election in a few years' time will be fought against an extremely good economic background. That is why Opposition Members are so glum and do not want to believe what is happening: they can see clearly that there will be low inflation, high growth, more prosperity and more jobs, in Wales as in the rest of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomery)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt the rivulets of rhetoric and ask the right hon. Gentleman where the Budget makes provision for jobs to replace the jobs that will be lost as a result of the savage cut in hill livestock compensatory allowances that was announced yesterday as the Budget was being delivered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a bit rich for the hon. and learned Gentleman to intervene so early in the debate when he spent much of our recent debate on the floor of the House deliberately preventing me from dealing with issues that are of concern to hon. Members and to people in Wales. The fact that I gave way to him so early in my speech shows what a generous spirit I have. The hon. and learned Gentleman made an erroneous point, taking into account only one element of support for hill farming, rather than all the elements of support from the common agricultural policy. He does not want to know that hill farming incomes have been increasing and that the common agricultural policy is giving more generous treatment. Instead he puts his finger on one small part of a much broader issue and will not admit—he will never admit—that things are getting better. Many hill farmers have been experiencing rising incomes this year and will be pleased by the increases announced under the common
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
agricultural policy in the recent statement on public spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amid the welter of information produced in connection with the Budget, one aspect has received too little attention. Page 16 of the Red Book states in a rather technical language and even, perhaps, in a little jargon:
	<br><blockquote><p>"gilt sales will be some £6.8 billion lower than indicated by the normal operation of the full fund policy. This will help to ease the exceptional degree of cash shortage in the money markets."</p></blockquote>
[Hon. Members: "Eh?"] The Opposition do not understand that that is perhaps the most important item in the Budget. Either they have missed it or they do not understand it. What that statement means is that we are serious about recovery and will ensure that money conditions are right so that business can expand and so that jobs are created. That follows the great success of our policy in recent months, cutting interest rates from 15 per cent. to 5.5 per cent. As a result, there has been a pick-up in lending, a pick-up in business activity and a pick-up in jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnor)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition in general may not understand these matters, but one of their number who tends to understand them is the right hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), who, I am sorry to say, is not in his place this morning. Did my right hon. Friend share my incredulity upon hearing the right hon. Gentleman broadcasting to Wales this morning that the Government had "a fetish" about reducing the public sector borrowing requirement? Contrary to the remarks that my right hon. Friend has just made concerning gilts, and the difficulty with the level of Government borrowing the right hon. Gentleman said that there was no difficulty in funding that level of public borrowing for many years to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. His remarks show that there is still a lack of comprehension on the Opposition Benches about how to make an economy work well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Swansea, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way when I have dealt with my hon. Friend's point, which was an extremely good one. Any responsible Government must bring the deficit down. The essence of the Budget is that the deficit is being brought down by economic recovery, which will generate more tax revenues, as well as by a judicious mixture of tax increases in the two Budgets this year and sensible reductions in public spending, which were also much needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Anderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the right hon. Gentleman is adopting a somewhat sneering and patronising tone towards Committee members, the majority of them Opposition Members, can hardly endear him to those on the Opposition Benches. Would it not be better if he adopted a little humility—first, asking himself why the deficit arose in the first place and, secondly, reminding himself that his bullish opening remarks are exactly similar to those of the Chancellor last year, and the year before, and the year before that? Chancellors have repeatedly assured us that the tax decreases would lead to greater investment by business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Last year, the Chancellor made optimistic forecasts and they proved to be right. We have had a year of growth, a year of progress and even a year of diminishing unemployment, which I hope the Opposition will welcome. Of course, we must correct the ravages that the recession has wrought on the public finances and we need more jobs. Central to the Budget is the creation of conditions for enterprise and prosperity to ensure that those jobs come forward. Jobs are already coming forward: we predicted last year that that would happen and some have come, and we predict it again this year and there will be more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Hain 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Neath)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli this morning, surely the Secretary of State will agree that there is no problem funding the deficit. What is involved is investment: it is easy to fund it at the moment. The problem is that the Government's deficit is primarily structural, in terms of the cost of unemployment and so on. That is why the Government are in such trouble. May I also refer the right hon. Gentleman to p.97 of the Red Book and ask why the figures given for Welsh Office spending in this year and the coming years are different from those in the Welsh Office press release issued yesterday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will find that there is some rounding of the figures in the Treasury booklet, which accounts for any divergencies that the hon. Gentleman may have noticed. On his more substantial point, it is true that an element of the deficit is the result of the recession, and that that element will reduce as employment and activity pick up and as tax revenues arise from the recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also true that quite a lot of the deficit is to finance large programmes of public capital expenditure. The tables in the Red Book show, on different definitions, between £22 billion and £29 billion-worth of fixed domestic capital formation or capital investment in the public sector, which will be financed by borrowing. It is perfectly reasonable to finance capital investment by borrowing. If the projects are good, if there will be a good return from them, and if there are future revenues. If they are other types of investment, one must be careful, however. If there is no revenue to match the interest charges, one has to consider the impact on taxation in future years of meeting the cost of such projects, even though they are of a capital nature.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cynog Dafis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ceredigion and Pembroke, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State think for a moment about the massive implications for the Welsh economy of the increases in fuel prices which are occurring now and will continue for several years? Does he accept that they will have an enormous impact on the Welsh economy, which suffers from peripherality and has many scattered communities and a scattered economic structure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Welsh Office undertake to carry out a thorough investigation of the implications of that for the Welsh economy and, in particular, ensure that there is corresponding investment in public transport, specifically in rail freight development? I hope that the Secretary of State will ensure that when the results of the prescribing analyses and costs study of freight and railways in Wales emerges, there will be a response and a willingness
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
substantially to invest in an area which will be important in an age of increasing road fuel prices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition parties and Members of Parliament—especially but not only the Liberal Democrats—are usually queueing up to urge us to be greener and holier than they are. They are always suggesting that fuel should be made more expensive and that motorists should be penalised. We have come up with sensible measures which take into account the fact that fuel prices have been falling in real terms. What we have suggested is a good compromise between the desire to fulfil our green commitments and not making prices unrealistic for people in rural areas. Were the Opposition parties ever let loose, motorists would be clobbered severely and great damage would be done to people in rural areas as a result. The Opposition parties are always telling us, "Cane the motorist, put up the taxes on all kinds of fuel." They believe that we should be greener than we have suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) that rail can make an important contribution to our transport needs. I have had a conversation with the chairman of British Rail about how the railway system can work better for Wales and how it can be marketed more effectively. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport's proposals will make it that much easier to have a competitive, hungry, decent railway which successfully competes for more business, from both freight and passenger traffic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barry Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Alyn and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned transport and the predicament of the motorist. May I raise with him the prospects of the £60 million River Dee crossing project, which is urgent and important to the community and that I represent? Will he give Clwyd county the transport supplementary grant that will be sufficient not only to begin the project in the next year, but to enable the county authority to undertake that great project as soon as possible? Does he agree that the crossing should be built, and built urgently, and that it would help the community that I represent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that that is an important project. I shall make an announcement soon about the priorities in the road programme and the money available for roads financed by local authorities and by the Government. The hon. Gentleman can rest assured that I shall recognise the importance of the project when I announce my decision.

I was discussing the favourable impact of lower interest rates before a series of interventions diverted the Committee's attention. To remind the Committee, big interest rate reductions have given a huge injection of money to British business—£12,000 million extra a year—and a welcome injection to many household budgets. The average mortgage holder is £170 a month better off as a result of the big reductions in the main base rates and the mortgage rates related to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of that can already be seen in retail sales, which are moving ahead nicely. That is feeding through to demand for goods from factories in Wales and elsewhere. Improved retail sales and higher disposable incomes for those with mortgages have been accompanied by a change in tone and mood throughout Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom.

The trend of share prices is a reliable indicator that politicians cannot arrange or fix. New highs have been registered for many months, reflecting the confidence of investors at home and abroad in British industry and showing that the City believes that profits are rising and will rise strongly. That is good news for investment and for jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Land prices are beginning to stabilise or move ahead in areas of the United Kingdom in which they have been hard hit. There are growing signs of confidence in house building and in commercial property. My recent discussions with house builders and with commercial property specialists in Wales and in the rest of the United Kingdom have been very different in tone from those of a couple of years ago. The questions that now are being asked concern land availability, planning permissions, looking into the future and creating new opportunities, whereas a year or two ago they concerned high interest rates, the lack of tenant demand and the impact of the recession on such businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Property development and redevelopment will be an important part of building the new Wales. We need the confidence and support of the people involved in that business to ensure that the valleys initiative is seen through to a successful conclusion, that the Cardiff Bay development corporation also makes good progress and that, throughout Wales, modern business is properly equipped with the right buildings.

Economic progress has been most visible in the past year. Unemployment has fallen throughout the United Kingdom, by 129,000 for the United Kingdom as a whole and by 2,400 in Wales in the past month—a most encouraging figure. I should like to remind the Committee briefly of the position in March 1986, when unemployment was last at very high levels. In those days, Wales had 13.8 per cent. unemployment. In the rest of the United Kingdom, unemployment was at 11.2 per cent. Today, the United Kingdom and Wales both have an unemployment rate of 10.2 per cent. That rate is below the unacceptably high levels of 1986, but in Wales the fall has been much greater. Unemployment in Wales is now in fine with the rest of the United Kingdom and below the European Community average. Welsh and United Kingdom unemployment is falling while unemployment in most of the rest of Europe is going up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Secretary of State is extolling the virtues of his Government's economic policy, will he bear in mind that, in my constituency over the past 12 months, more than 1,000 jobs have been lost at Du Pont, Parke Davies Royal Ordnance and elsewhere? Those were well paid, highly skilled jobs. If they are to be replaced at all, it will be by low-skilled jobs that do not offer much money. Such jobs are sometimes part time and sometimes temporary.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It certainly is not my vision, nor is it the reality.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hain</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State referred to unemployment figures.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that unemployment is too high, especially in the valleys. That is why I intend to put much effort into the valleys initiative.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. It is a great embarrassment to the Labour party that its leader has signed up to a socialist manifesto in Europe that includes a large number of job-destroying measures which would threaten people in Wales and in the rest of the United Kingdom.

	<br><blockquote><p>"There are just no jobs about. The Job Centre has never notified me of any job and I've said I'll work at anything …</p></blockquote>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pontypridd)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Secretary of State for being so generous in giving way. How will the unemployed be helped by the fact that they are now to be removed from the register after six months and that, if their wives or husbands work more than 16 hours per week—regardless of the hourly rate of pay—there will be no income support for them? How can that possibly help unemployed people in south Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be benefit for all those who need help with their family budget to pay the bills. [Hon. Members: "There will not."] The scheme was clearly outlined by the Chancellor, who made it clear that no one would be in want as a result of the proposals. But surely it makes sense to bring together two rather complicated benefits with separate administrative structures and operate a single benefit. We want to spend the money on services and people and not on administration and bureaucracy. That was a vital theme of the Budget, which Opposition Members would be well advised to study and to which they should accord some merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State appears to have misunderstood the point made by the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), which was that if an unemployed person's spouse is working more than 16 hours a week, for however modest an income, after six months the unemployed person will drop out of the unemployment register. That provides the Government with an enormous presentational advantage. They will be able to claim that unemployment has lessened when it could easily have gone up. Only claimants appear on the unemployment register, and people will cease to be claimants after six months, even if their spouses have only a modest income from 16 hours work. They will disappear from the register and appear not to exist. The Government will do nothing for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the scheme. Its importance is that anyone who needs financial help will receive it, but there is no point in providing two separate benefits through two separate and cumbersome administrative structures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Secretary of State give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make progress in developing my argument about how the economy will improve. Unemployment is down and inflation is down. At 1.4 per cent. it is well below the European Community average and the levels in such countries as Italy, Spain and Germany. We do not hear much about that from Opposition Members. A particularly encouraging aspect of the Budget is that the Chancellor strongly believes that inflationary pressures are subdued and therefore that we can advance, allow more money into circulation and go for growth without adversely affecting inflation. Of course, my right hon. and learned Friend will take no risks with inflation, but he judges that he can now expand the economy further because inflation is well down and there is no immediate sign of any resurgence of inflationary pressures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
It is good news that international commodity prices are weak—or certainly not going out of control, at any rate. It is good news that many prices in the shops and elsewhere are now stable or, in some cases, falling, because of the competitive conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Output is rising. It is up this year and is expected to do well again next year—at a time when industrial output is down in Japan and Germany and in many major countries of the European Community. There are well-based forecasts for strong growth in future years. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor is expecting growth in output in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996. I am sure that he is right to do so, because the economy is now performing strongly and encouragingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget had to address the crucial issue of the deficit. As we come out of recession, it will begin to fall anyway, because some expenditures caused by recession will decline and taxation revenue will pick up. The Budget produced a sensible mixture of further public expenditure reductions instead of the planned increases that we announced a year earlier, as well as some modest tax proposals to add to those in the March Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within his range of measures, my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor was able to produce tax proposals that will be extremely beneficial to business interests. Small business is crucial to the generation of jobs and prosperity in Wales, and a range of measures will be welcomed by small and emerging businesses. There is a good increase in the VAT threshold, which means that many small businesses will no longer have to worry about paperwork. There is a good reduction in regulations affecting small business, including audit and the pay-as-you-earn system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are proposals to tackle the difficult matter of late payment of debt, which has been a major issue for small business during the recession. That is a welcome sign from my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about consultation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members object to the Chancellor consulting on those matters. Surely it makes much more sense for the business community to make known what it thinks about them and to offer suggestions. Instead of being so churlish from a sedentary position, the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery, who is trying to stir the pot again, ought to be a better democrat by allowing me to speak in big debates—and stand if he wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islwyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->

Will the right hon. Gentleman concede that the consultation exercise, welcome though it is, is far from being proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is right—it is a consultation exercise, but my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor signalled clearly his wish to do something about that problem. I hope that Opposition Members welcome that.

For larger firms, which had inquired about these, there was welcome news about Export Credits Guarantee Department premiums and cover for various overseas markets. For businesses of all sizes, there was a welcome reduction in the proposed increases in the business rate. That will make an important contribution to their cash flow, compared with the increases they would have faced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Secretary of State aware that not only large private sector businesses but Government Departments, especially in the health service, are responsible for creating that problem for small businesses? Is he aware that some trusts refuse to pay invoices for up to three months? As, apparently, the right hon. Gentleman favours the proposals, will he instruct those hospitals and trusts in Wales—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and local authorities. Will the right hon. Gentleman instruct them, and organisations that he controls, to honour the commitment that he appears to give?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is Government policy, and my policy, that bills should be paid on time when work has been done or a service supplied to the required standard. I would like to know about people or institutions within the umbrella of the Welsh Office that do not follow that policy, and I shall personally pursue the matter. I agree that what is fair practice for big companies is also fair practice for Government—and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) mentioned—for local government. Government and local government together account for huge spending power in the Welsh economy. They are extremely important to many small businesses and it is only fair that small firms be paid on time when they have done a good job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor also rightly placed considerable emphasis on the need to attract yet more private capital into investment schemes, on top of the public capital produced by the Government—for both partnership schemes, where the Government finance part and the private sector the other part, and privately financed schemes that it would otherwise have fallen to the public sector to pay for. I hope to see more than £400 million of private finance come forward for such schemes in Wales, with special concentration on the work of the Welsh Development Agency, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation and Housing for Wales, where we believe there are good opportunities for raising more capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pensioners are big beneficiaries from the Budget, to protect them from the impact of value added tax on fuel. The package was far more generous and wide-ranging than people expected, and rightly so, because my right hon. and learned Friend and I do not wish pensioners to be in the cold, unable to pay heating bills. That is why we have approved improvements in cold weather payments, an across-the-board pensions increase and major increases in benefits to cover the cost to those receiving benefit. We have also launched interesting new savings bonds to help people whose savings income has been adversely affected by the fall in interest rates, which were so important to businesses and mortgage holders. The combined package means that every pensioner will benefit and enjoy some reprieve from the impact of VAT on fuel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that the family spending survey for 1992, available through the good offices of the House of Commons Library, makes it clear that a single pensioner faced with an average weekly fuel bill will need an extra 74p to cover the 8 per cent VAT from April, and an extra £1.62 a week in 1995, and that yesterday's announcements went nowhere near covering those average figures? Does he also accept that because many rural areas of Wales do not have the benefit of a supply of gas—usually the most economical fuel—their average heating bills are far higher than those of other parts? Does he not agree that the Chancellor's announcement is a sham that goes nowhere near covering the VAT payment required of single pensioners or people receiving benefits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with those calculations. The Government believe that our generous measures will protect pensioners from the impact of VAT on fuel and from increased fuel bills. The hon. Gentleman must also take into account the fall in the cost of fuel in recent times. We believe that pensioners will be able to keep warm and not have to fear the bill because of the range of increases that we have introduced for savers, for those on standard pensions and for people receiving benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kinnock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I put it to the Secretary of State that the figure of 74p is the figure endorsed by Help the Aged, which is in no sense a partisan body? Can he assure the Committee that if, at the end of the next financial year, it is demonstrated that the effect of the 8 per cent. VAT levy on fuel bills has been to produce an additional average cost of 74p for single pensioner households, his right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will come to the House and admit that because of the extra VAT the additional cost of fuel bills has been not 50p, as announced in November 1993, but 74p?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman said that fuel costs have fallen, but is it not true to say that standing charges have not fallen? Can he explain why pensioner households will have to pay 17.5 per cent. VAT on standing charges, whatever happens to fuel costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that what matters is the bill and what people pay, but to

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
get at the truth of that it is necessary to take into account the movement in fuel prices and, of course, standing charges, as well as the impact of the tax. The Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Social Security have produced their proposals, which are far more generous than people thought. They believe that they will deal with the problem. The subject will be debated in many places over the next few weeks, but I am happy that there has been a generous response to a difficult problem. I am pleased to recommend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next main subject is public spending and the extra £320 million for Wales. Where are they now, my critics of recent weeks who said that I would slash public spending in Wales, lose out in Cabinet arguments about public spending in Wales and short-change public spending in Wales? All that is untrue. Instead, we have an extra £320 million—a 5 per cent. increase in cash expenditure. Why is the increase so great? It is so great—I am pleased that it is so great—because a lot will go on health and on education, which are the Government's priority areas throughout the United Kingdom. The needs of Wales have been recognised by my right hon. Friends in the settlement that I am able to announce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the next few weeks I shall be making detailed announcements about the distribution of the £320 million and the money in the current year budget, which will also be available next year as additional money, to show my hon. Friends and Opposition hon. Members how priorities are going to develop. I will today confine my remarks to saying that education and health are the top of the list. They are the big spending areas and will be looked after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State mentioned that the £320 million is 5 per cent. in cash terms. When it is spent in the Welsh economy, what will its real value be? I have seen a figure which placed it at 0.9 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not be that mingy in assessing the real impact. We can do better than that in obtaining value for money—1.4 per cent. for retail prices or about 2 to 2.5 per cent. for wages in the public sector, or perhaps a little less. There is plenty of scope within a 5 per cent. cash increase to buy real improvements in services, more investment for Wales and a better quality of life in Wales. That is my intention, and that of my right hon. Friend the Minister of State and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. We want that money wisely spent so that it means better health care, better education and training, more people being educated to a higher standard and good programmes to promote and encourage the economic development of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State cannot get away with saying that there will be a massive increase in expenditure. On page 118 of the Red Book, it is clearly shown that the estimated outturn for 1993–94 is £6.1 billion. The figures for 1994–95, 1995–96 and 1996–97 are £6.2 billion. That is a £ 100 million increase in real terms over three years, not a £300 million or £400 million increase in one year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the figures. Clearly there is £320 million more. As I have explained, if my right hon. Friend, my hon. Friend and I are good at obtaining value for the money that we spend, we can translate that £320 million into a high real increase in services and quality. That is our intention. Opposition Members may try to stop us, but will not succeed. I intend to press on because I owe that to the taxpayers and the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to announce a proposal in the road programme which is important to many Opposition Members. I want to give priority to the major strategic routes. In 1994 the A55 from Chester to Bangor will be completed. It is the main route for north Wales and is crucial to its economic development. In the months ahead the M4 will be completed, creating a 200 mile motorway from south Wales to London, which is a vital artery for south Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe also that the A465 should be an important route—another vital economic artery to serve the top of the valleys in the same way as the M4 serves successfully the coastal plain and the bottom of the valleys. Therefore, I am announcing today that we are letting the contract for the section from Aberdulais to Glynneath—9 miles of road, at around £80 million. I have asked officials to propose the other section. I am awaiting their advice on the extent to which we can accelerate the programme, but I want the entire route from Abergavenny to Neath to be completed as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is making an important statement about a lifeline to our valleys communities. He will know that it is not planned to make a dual carriageway of the A465—the heads of the valley road—until nearly the end of the century. Is he now saying that he is setting a much earlier target for the dualling of the A465?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, in the interests of accuracy, I refer him to page 118 of the Red Book, about which the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Mr. Wigley) spoke. I suggest that that page deals with funny money and is an expression in real terms. Let us talk about proper pounds, shillings and pence. Page 117 shows the new control total. In actual money terms, the columns on that page state clearly the figure of £320 million that my right hon. Friend cited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The people of Neath have been waiting for that for far too long. During the past 14 years nearly 30 people have died on the stretch of road between Aberdulais and Glynneath and there have been many more accidents than fatalities. Will the work be funded fully by the Welsh Office? Can he confirm that there will be no toll and that there is no other private investment or funding?

Many jobs are coming to Wales; many jobs are needed. Between January and October 1993, 148 inward investment projects were announced amounting to £639 million-worth of investment. There might have been others with which we were not involved or about which we do not know. That is a big boost for Wales and a sign that Wales is competitive and is still an extremely attractive place for the world's investors, as I confirmed for myself in September when I visited many overseas investors and sought their advice and encouragment. Many investors in Wales think that Wales is a great place in which to do business and are planning to expand there as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent months good progress has been made with the Hamilton Oil and Connah's quay developments, which have generated more than 2,000 construction jobs in that area of north-east Wales. The proud roll call of good names from abroad has grown in Wales with the arrival of Sega, Aiwa, ASAT and several others from Japan, Hong Kong and America. It is a sign that Wales is being taken seriously around the world as a manufacturing centre. I am putting a lot of effort—and I am asking my officials to do the same—into the "Source Wales" initiative. Now that we have shown that we can assemble things in Wales, we need to ensure that we produce as many of the components for the assembly plants in Wales as is possible. Much has been done and more can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall also announce in a few days more details of the apprenticeship scheme which was announced in outline yesterday for England. I, too, wish to have an apprenticeship scheme in Wales, with a particular emphasis on engineering skills. Currently, I am finishing off the details of that plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Urban regeneration and regeneration of the valleys are still high on my list of priorities. I shall soon announce the strategic development scheme results. Under that scheme, we have offered money to local authorities if they can come forward with a strategic vision of the future of their areas and with projects that will make that vision come true. I announced recently the £1,000 million valleys programme over the five-year period that stretches ahead. Already, the valleys initiative has resulted in the improvement of 7,000 homes, in the clearance of 2,000 acres of delelict land, and in £700 million of new private investment. In addition, 24,000 jobs have been created or secured. That is a good record. It ill behoves some Opposition Members to knock the valleys initiative. They should lift the sights of the valleys, be proud of what has been achieved and work to attract more inward
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
investment because, of course, more needs to be done. All hon. Members need to explain to investors both at home and abroad that the valleys are improving. They are a great place for businesses to locate, and they offer opportunities for profitable and successful investment.

When the shadow Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) comes to reply, I hope that he will be ready to tell the Committee how much money—even if it is only shadow money—he would be able to get from the shadow Cabinet. However, I expect to hear nothing from him on that subject. I doubt whether he has even raised with the shadow Cabinet the matter of how much additional spending could be committed to Wales. If the hon. Gentleman did raise the matter, I doubt that he had much success or was given much loose change to add to the £320 million that I have announced today. My guess is that the members of the shadow Cabinet are so busy plotting and planning little tricks against the Government that they have not sat down recently to discuss the budget for the year ahead, nor worked out their spending plans. Well, that is realistic in one sense: the shadow Cabinet are not the Government, nor are they likely to be. However, I am sure that the people of Wales would like to hear what the Labour party's alternative vision consists of. They would certainly like to know how much money might be provided on top of what has been announced by me today and by my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor yesterday. So I hope that the hon. Member for Caerphilly will tell the Committee how much a Labour Government would provide, on what that money would be spent, how it would improve matters and how it would fit in with Labour's overall economic and budgetary strategy. I do not expect to hear very much, because I suspect that neither the hon. Gentleman nor the shadow Cabinet have done anything for Wales in their recent discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In contrast, the Government have produced a Budget for prosperity, a Budget for growth, and a Budget for jobs. The Budget is just the job for Wales. It will get things moving. It will mean that more businesses grow and develop. It will mean better public services in Wales. It is good news for Wales and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I apologise to the Committee for the fact that there has been a slight technical hitch in our proceedings? The Order Paper and the motion that was moved this morning refer to the resumption of our proceedings at Four o'clock this afternoon. However, the card that was sent to all hon. Members specified a resumption at 4.30 pm. I ask the Committee to disregard the time stated on the card, which was simply the result of a printing error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.18 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was flattered by the Secretary of State's interest in the proceedings of the shadow Cabinet. He said he did not expect me to talk about the shadow Cabinet proposals; I am pleased to say that I do not intend to disappoint him. I am sure that he would like to talk about anything under the sun other than his Government's Budget—I intend to talk about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman started in a very bullish mood. The heart of his case is that the Government have achieved a reduction in the public sector borrowing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
requirement, in interest charges, in inflation rates and that everything else followed from that. It is worth studying those three claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the first claim relating to the reduction in the PSBR from £50 billion, the Secretary of State omitted to tell the Committee that he and his Government played a full part in creating that total in the first place. It results largely from their own incompetence and their deliberate and flagrant attempt to bribe the British electorate with their own money prior to the general election. That is why we have a £50 billion PSBR. It is a little breathtaking for the Secretary of State to claim that the Government have reduced it. Millions of people in Britain and hundreds of thousands of people in Wales will be treated most brutally as a result of the Government's attempts to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Secretary of State referred to a reduction in interest charges. I am sure that we all welcome such a reduction. Those charges have only been as low as they currently are three times in the past 14 years. They were very low in 1983, which was an election year, they were very low in 1987, which was an election year; and they were very low in 1992, which was an election year. In three years out of 14 we had low interest rates. For the remaining 11 years, the interest rates were well into double figures. If the Secretary of State wishes to claim that low interest rates are good for the Welsh economy and the British economy, what has he got to say about those 11 years, when inflation remained in double figures as a deliberate instrument of Government policy? That is a direct question to the Secretary of State, which I should be grateful if he would answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Redwood</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Throughout the 1980s, we combined low inflation with very rapid growth. On those occasions, higher interest rates were necessary to control the pace of growth, but they were not getting in the way of growth. Had the Labour party put together anything like the record that we put together in the 1980s. It might have won more elections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Secretary of State is unaware of his Government's record. In 1981, interest rates were 14 per cent., the inflation rate was 12 per cent. and the unemployment rate was more than 8 per cent. In 1990, interest rates were 15 per cent., inflation rate was 10 per cent. and the unemployment rate was 6 per cent. When a new Government take office, it is a reasonable excuse to say that there must be a period of time to turn round the economy. The Conservative Government, however, have been in office for 14 years and on three successive occasions, they have ensured that false booms were generated purely for party political interest, with the result that damage was inflicted on the British economy. It is unacceptable for them now to argue that they have achieved an economic miracle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last time that interest rates were as low as they are now was in 1977, at the time of a Labour Government In 1977, the unemployment rate was 4 per cent That is not a bad record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have demonstrated that if the economy is flattened and an enormous burden is placed on people by deliberately creating unemployment inflation can be cured. We have not needed the past 15 years to learn that lesson.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State can claim only that the Government have reduced the PSBR, interest charges and inflation to acceptable levels, having pushed them up to unacceptable levels, he does not have much of a case to put to the Committee.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that in 1977 real interest rates were negative? That position was unstable and is incapable of being repeated.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 1977 the western economy—the whole world economy—was facing far greater strains than now. Since then—since 1978 and 1979—the British economy has benefited enormously as a result of North sea oil. That created an unprecedented boom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the British economy had had the enormous benefits of North sea oil in the late 1970s and had not suffered the stresses that were placed on the world economy as a result of international oil price rises, we should certainly not have been in the predicament that we faced in 1977.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am proud of two facts. First, that the previous Labour Government was not prepared to use mass unemployment as a direct instrument of Government policy. I shall defend that policy anywhere. Secondly, I am proud that the leader of the Labour party went to the Trades Union Congress this year and said that the creation of a society of full employment was to be the Labour party's central goal. I look forward to the next election, when the people of Britain will have to choose between that and other options. I am happy at any time to debate with the hon. Gentleman the economic and social costs of employment policies. I shall certainly give way to him again if he wants to debate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Understandably, the Secretary of State wanted to have a little fun at my expense, and I hope to be able to do the same in reply. The best that we can say about his speech is that it was utterly meaningless to the people of Wales. There was nothing in it that offered any prospect of dealing with present problems and nothing that tackled those of the future. The best that can be said about the Secretary of State is that he is not in touch with reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us who represent Welsh constituencies, who are aware of matters there day to day and week to week, understand local conditions and the impact of the Budget on our constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's political judgment is influenced by three factors. First, it is influenced by what I am sure he would acknowledge with some pride as his own right-wing ideology; secondly, by his membership of a Cabinet that I think we all—even his own colleagues—would now recognise to be discredited and dishonest; and thirdly, by a parliamentary constituency that gives him no experience or understanding of the problems that we face in Wales. Whatever those factors give him, it is certainly not a mandate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or two comparisons would be instructive in understanding the perspective of the Secretary of State and that of hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies. My hon. Friend the Member for Neath made a point about using economic inactivity as a measure of prosperity. According to that measure, the Secretary of State's constituency emerges as one of the most affluent in England and Wales. Wokingham—I am not at all jealous—comes 520th out of 562. By contrast, Wales provides eight of the 20 constituencies with the highest level of economic inactivity. And we all know that they are valley constituencies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's constituency has the fifth lowest rate of unemployment in the United Kingdom. The best placed Welsh constituency is Montgomery, which is an exception in Welsh terms, but barely in the top 50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Carlile</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course we are grateful in Montgomery that we are low in the unemployment league and that there has been a lot of inward investment; but does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a great difference between Wokingham and Montgomery, in that
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
wages in Montgomery are massively lower than those in Wokingham?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with the hon. and learned Gentleman and endorse his earlier intervention which referred to the £25 million cut in hill livestock compensatory allowance. I assure him that my hon. Friends and I will vigorously resist the cuts in HLCAs. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman and other hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies will be united in rejecting the cut. It will be interesting to see whether the hon. Members for Monmouth (Mr. Evans), for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) and for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans), who have considerable farming interests, will on this occasion have the courage of their convictions and vote for their constituencies' interests—not against, as they did previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wokingham has the lowest incidence of long-term limiting illness of any constituency in the United Kingdom. Did not we see that when the Secretary of State clearly failed to understand the points raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Pontypridd, for Neath and for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger), who questioned him about the vicious attack on unemployment and invalidity benefits? The Secretary of State did not understand the questions and certainly did not understand the answers that he gave the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The five constituencies in England and Wales with the greatest amount of long-term illness are Welsh, as are six out of the next 15. If car ownership is the measure, the right hon. Gentleman's constituency comes top in England and Wales. My constituency—by no means the most impoverished in Wales—comes 362nd. That is a measure of the difference in perspective. As he is in such unique circumstances, the Secretary of State should have a little humility when addressing the Committee, as my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) said. He should at least try to understand the problems of Wales, to come to terms with the problems of its economy and to work with the grain of Welsh opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of that, he has taken a conscious decision to rewrite the role of the Secretary of State for Wales. He sees his role as that of a pace setter for the English Tory party. I say "the English Tory party" because the Tory party has virtually ceased to function in Wales. He is a man with few friends in Wales and little influence in the Cabinet, as the shambles of the local government reform Bill demonstrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also know that the right hon. Gentleman's Welsh Office staff are as unpopular with the Secretary of State as he is with them. Last month, the BBC reported a titanic struggle in the Welsh Office. In October if reported that "The Welsh Secretary"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. My understanding of the debate is that it is concerned with the implications of the Budget announced by the Chancellor yesterday.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, the subject of the debate is the implications of the Budget. The hon. Member for Caerphilly has made a slight diversion, but I am sure that he will get back to the main issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am desperately anxious to focus on that, and to ensure that the Secretary of State understands his responsibilities for economic policy in Wales. The BBC reported a struggle. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Welsh Secretary is engaged in a battle with his own civil servants over the advice he's getting and the way his decisions are carried out … Mr. Redwood is known to be unhappy with the service he's getting from officials in his new department: he feels he's often being kept in the dark about what's going on in the Welsh Office, and finds that his correspondence is sometimes ignored by civil servants."</p></blockquote>
That is a strange set of affairs, but there is an explanation. We are indebted to David Cornock, the political editor of the 
	<i>Western Mail.</i> In an exclusive in October, he reported:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Welsh Secretary John Redwood has spent only one night in Wales since his appointment more than four months ago.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>His sole overnight stay was to attend June's Welsh Conservative conference at Llangollen. He has yet to stay in Wales on Government business."</p></blockquote>
It is no wonder that he can speak with no authority on the Budget's implications for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, things have changed and he now wants to work closely with his staff on Budget matters. He has sent? a letter to "All Welsh Office Staff", dated November 1993, which states—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richards</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hughes. Does a letter that was written by the Secretary of State to his staff about internal administrative matters have anything to do with our debate on the implications of the Budget for Wales?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall find out whether the letter is relevant when we have heard it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hughes. I can assure the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Mr. Richards) that it is directly relevant. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I and my ministerial colleagues get from you a generally very high quality of advice and support … I have already been able to visit parts of the Office and hope to get round more in the near future … I wish to be involved"—</p></blockquote>
the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West should listen to this point carefully—
	<br><blockquote><p>"in major policy issues including planning, local government, health and urban affairs."</p></blockquote>
I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to be involved in those issues, but I am sad that he does not seem to understand that we have particular problems in Wales which he should be addressing. The Secretary of State is isolated and realises that he is unloved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Evans</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The intervention was from a sedentary position, so the hon. Gentleman need not respond. I ask him to get on with the subject of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hughes. Yesterday's Budget will be enormously damaging to Wales. We will suffer from tax increases and cuts in the welfare state which will attack the poorest and most vulnerable,
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
including pensioners, the unemployed and part-time workers. There is no sign of the positive action that is needed to tackle the biggest problem facing us, which is the social and economic cost of unemployment. Not one of us will forget the cynicism of the Tory party in accepting that unemployment—always for someone else—was the price worth paying for their policies. This year the cost of unemployment in Wales alone is almost £1.2 billion, and we can see all around us the social consequences of that economic failure in the dislocation of community life, the strains on family life and the impoverishment of personal life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Ann Clwyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cynon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to unemployment. I have just heard that men at the Towy colliery in my constituency, which is the last remaining pit in south Wales, are to be told at a pithead meeting at one o'clock today that unless they increase productivity by Christmas, the pit will shut at Christmas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the pits with the highest productivity in the country. Productivity there increased 118 per cent. in the past year. I am sure that my hon. Friend will reflect on that sell-out of all the promises that the Conservative party made to men in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two significant points in that intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley (Mrs. Clwyd). First, that pit is the last deep pit that we have in the south Wales coalfield. Secondly, together with 30 others, the pit was promised barely 12 months ago that it would be reprieved. We know that the country and the Conservative party were deceived by the Government's pretence that a measure of protection was being extended to that coalfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cynon Valley fought a valiant battle to defend the interests of her constituents and of that pit. I assure her that I and all my colleagues will give her whatever help we can to defend those jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like that betrayal, yesterday's Budget was a continuation in the process of betrayal of all the promises made in 1992 when the present Government were elected. As we now see, that election victory was based on lies and deceit. When hon. Members go through the Lobby to support the Budget, they will be betraying not only their own promises, but the best interests of their constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will examine three of those big lies. The first—"If you vote Conservative on Thursday, the recovery starts on Friday"—was the Prime Minister's personal commitment to the British electorate. Unemployment in Wales is still well over 10 per cent. and there is no sign of a meaningful drop in that figure before the end of the century. Let us put on record that the highest figure recorded under the last Labour Government was 5.7 per cent. We are the only major European Union country and the only G7 country in which output is lower now than it was in 1990—coincidentally, the year in which John Major was Chancellor and then became Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's opening remarks referred to the valleys initiative. His own statistical department has confirmed the failure of that initiative, with 6,500 manufacturing jobs lost during the period of that programme. Those job losses demonstrate directly the real problem faced by the British economy—its lack of capacity. We import too much, we have too little growth and we therefore have too much unemployment.

During the 1980s—which, as we now know, is the golden age that never was—regardless of the picture presented by the fiddled unemployment figures, the number of men working in Wales fell 50,000—a drop of 10 per cent. in our male work force. The Budget not only fails to address that need by introducing new policies to invest in infrastructure, encourage new business or develop more coherent training strategies, but it will diminish the capacity of the Welsh economy to move out of recession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Development Agency will be seriously underfunded. What is happening to that neatly mirrors what is happening to the UK economy as a whole. The Government have developed asset stripping to a fine art. In the UK as a whole, more than £100 billion-worth of assets have been sold and the proceeds frittered away on a senseless and wasteful economic experiment. The WDA will now receive similar treatment. The Secretary of State surely understands that the WDA cannot spearhead our industrial regeneration if it must rely on forced asset sales on a year-to-year basis. The projected Welsh Office grant of £65 million falls far short of that required. The construction industry provides the most effective mechanism for reducing unemployment and stimulating the economy. Why on earth will Tai Cymru's budget be cut, local authorities' ability to build be virtually ended, and housing renovation grants be slashed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of those cuts and the deliberate damage that they will do to the housing prospects of thousands of Welsh men and women, I hope that the Secretary of State will have the decency to stop his moralising and scapegoating of single parents. They have as much right, to decent housing as the rest of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second big lie of that election was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will not have to increase taxes."</p></blockquote>
Those words were spoken by the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont)—who was then a candidate, subsequently became Chancellor of the Exchequer and is now a Back Bencher. I shall quote the right hon. Gentleman fully.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will not have to increase taxes. I can't see any circumstances in which that will be necessary."</p></blockquote>
This year's spring Budget gave us higher income tax, higher national insurance charges, cuts in mortgage tax relief and the most iniquitous tax of all—VAT on fuel. The party that gave us the poll tax has now given 570,000 pensioners in Wales a tax on staying warm—effectively, a tax on staying alive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The compensation package for pensioners is inadequate. More than that, thousands of low wage earners who are not on benefits will be particularly hard hit by that tax and will receive no compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the March Budget, a typical family will pay £8.50 more in tax every week from next April. As a result of yesterday's Budget, that figure will rise to £9.30 per week—that from a party that pledged that there would be no tax increases. By April 1995, the average family will be paying £16 per week extra tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be extra tax because of the freeze in personal allowances. There will be extra costs on homes and cars through the insurance tax, extra tax on holidays through the travel tax and extra tax on transport—devastating for mid-Wales and rural Wales—through the petrol tax. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
party that moralises about the family has given us effectively a new tax on marriage, through the changes in the married persons allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax increases are arbitrary and unfair and they will impact most severely on individuals who can least afford it, on Scotland and Wales and the regions of England that can least sustain them. They are designed not to plan for the aspirations of the future but to pay for the incompetence of the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third big lie concerns public expenditure. The Prime Minister—his words are worth reflecting on—said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If we're going to cut public expenditure we would have done it before and I don't believe it's economically right"—</p></blockquote>
there is nothing equivocal about that He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have said that in the past and there is no need to do it whatsoever. So you can rule out any prospect of that"</p></blockquote>
The Government did not hedge their bets then. The Prime Minister made that statement in March 1992. How on earth can it be reconciled with the Chancellor's statement yesterday and his actions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Wales is so out of touch with reality that he either does not understand or he does not care about the impact of those cuts on Wales. Time and again we have told him about the damage being done to the Welsh economy by the substitution of secure full-time jobs for men with temporary part-time jobs for women. That trend has made us vulnerable, and nowhere in Britain will yesterday's cuts in welfare benefits hit harder than in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment benefit will be withdrawn after six months. Currently, some 70,000 claimants in Wales are in that category, of whom 46,000 have been unemployed for more that 12 months. There are 24,000 potential victims—those with partners in employment more than 16 hours a week. Nearly all of us—certainly in the valley communities but in other areas as well—are familiar with the pattern of employment whereby there are unacceptably high levels of male unemployment and women have part-time temporary jobs in order to get some money to keep the family together. Those people will now face the choice of foregoing all benefits. Many women—to keep families together—will have to give up their jobs so that they can go back on income support. Is that the actions of a Government who encourage people to have independence and the spirit of determination to go out and fend for themselves?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a policy is an outrageous and unprecedented attack on our welfare state. Families will be driven deep into poverty and thousands of workers will be forced to give up work so that they become eligible once again for income support. The Secretary of State—he moralises and preaches about the sanctity of family life—is so out of touch with reality that he seems not to understand the effect of his own policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government call the measure the "job seekers' allowance". How will it encourage people to take up work? How will it encourage motivation, independence and responsibility, for which we should be especially looking in our young people? We all know that such a policy has nothing to do with an employment policy that will encourage enterprise or independence. It is a policy that is designed to cut public expenditure, and the Government are making their victims pay for the Government's own mistakes. Instead of attacking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0227">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
unemployment, the Government are attacking the unemployed—at a time when 10 jobless people are applying for every job vacancy in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A total of 147,000 people in Wales are now claiming invalidity benefit. Those people will all be subject to new medical tests that are designed to take them off benefit. Yesterday the Chancellor of the Exchequer implied that those people did not really deserve to be in receipt of the benefit. The Secretary of State does not understand the implications of the withdrawal of invalidity benefit. Nor does he understand what we all experience each Saturday morning in Wales, when people attend our constituency surgeries saying that they are confused because they have been sent before a board. I know people who were crippled at the age of 59 and who have been on invalidity benefit for years. They do not understand why a doctor, who has never even examined them, has declared that they are fit for work. There are no jobs anyway, even if they were fit for work. No Cabinet Minister who understood the implications of withdrawing invalidity benefit could sit around the Cabinet table and be party to such vicious and evil cuts in our welfare state. Off benefit, on to the dole, off the dole and on to nothing—that is the new welfare state that was promised to us yesterday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise my hon. Friend that my experience of my constituency is that the process has started. Each week I meet claimants who tell me, "I have been on invalidity benefit and they have withdrawn it. I have to go before a board. Why? I am 59 and I am crippled. My hon. Friend is worried about the combined impact of those cuts on our regional economy, and I am sure that he will develop that theme later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, because of the weakness of the Welsh economy, the Budget will hit Wales especially hard. There are proposed cuts in public spending of £10 billion by 1997, and they will inevitably hit very hard in Wales. Students, farmers, the unemployed, public sector workers, the national health service, housing and training are all in the front line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that £15 billion of tax increases are in the pipeline for 1995–96 and they will hit Wales disproportionately hard. Our low level of income will ensure that those taxes are taken straight out of spending capacity. When that is coupled with cuts in unemployment and invalidity benefits, on both of which we have a high dependency, it will ensure that the overall level of economic activity in Wales will suffer and the prospects of recovery will be further damaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Tory party will forever be identified as the party whose promises cannot be trusted and as the high tax party. Yesterday, the Chancellor may have delivered his Budget with a smile on his face, but it is the knife that he held in his hand that will do damage to Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.57 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have just listened to a speech which was strong in indignation, ritual and criticism, but let us look at the critic. It is—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I heard an observation made from a sedentary position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to examine the intellectual coherence of the propositions put forward by the hon. Member for Caerphilly. The first was that there was something wrong with the £15 billion public sector borrowing requirement. If there is something wrong with that and if it should never have been allowed to extend to that degree, any Government would have had either to cut public expenditure earlier and much more seriously or to increase taxes. That is—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] No. Either one adopts a policy of cutting public expenditure savagely, increasing taxes or both, or one deals with the public sector borrowing requirement, which the Government, quite properly, have allowed to continue in a difficult recession that was more protracted than was expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second extraordinary proposition from the hon. Member for Caerphilly was that interest rates fluctuated too much in the 1980s. He said that that occurred conveniently for electoral rather than economic management reasons. Presumably, he has noted that for more than 200 years there has been such a thing as the trade cycle. The question that the hon. Gentleman did not ask was, if the Government were wrong to use interest rate fluctuations to manage that cycle, what else could they do? They could, of course, put up taxes to counter its effect. If the hon. Member for Caerphilly is right, taxes would have to be increased much more at various times instead of using interest rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's third proposition was about the low level of inflation in 1977, but that was a transient and unstable state of affairs. The most astonishing feature of the 1970s, for which we are still paying, was that for the first time in 300 years interest rates were negative, and inflation was greater than any return that could be gained from Government stocks. That was not only extraordinarily damaging to people's savings and to pension funds and other assets, but had a knock-on effect throughout the 1980s and the 1990s. Throughout the world, markets and savers have insisted on unrealistically high real interest rates because of the fear that Governments would not maintain the sound value of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth proposition was that the Government had somehow driven up unemployment in the 1980s. We were offered a contrast between a policy of maximum employment and a policy of less employment—a key political problem. We are waiting for a coherent and persuasive argument on how that can be achieved. The theory in the 1970s was that if one pumped funny money into the economy, one would inevitably end up with more jobs. By the end of the 1970s, even Lord Callaghan realised that type of operation did not work but simply created more inflation. What does the hon. Member for Caerphilly suggest that Governments should do to increase employment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, Governments can do something. For example, if we proposed a measure to engage 100 research assistants for the Opposition spokesman for Wales, we might make life more convenient for him and increase his comfort. That would take people off the job
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
queues—but they would not have real jobs. When the state increases the number of its employees, the private sector has to pay the bill through taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Anderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest one thing that the Government should do? They now realise that they should increase the number of apprenticeships. The hon. Gentleman will recall that in the early 1980s—the heyday of the Thatcherite ideology—apprenticeship schemes were almost demolished and the Government withdrew from them. Only now have the Government returned to them. The Government might also have prevented so much money going into and heating up the property market, and used it instead in more productive areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Government listened to the argument and noted throughout the 1980s to place greater reliance on better training, more skills and more education. The old apprenticeship system was unhappily riddled with unsatisfactory restrictive practices. The Government are about to deal with that. The hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson) should admit that although it is highly desirable to have more qualifications, those who ultimately employ qualified staff must decide what are relevant qualifications. The burden must primarily be placed on employers to ensure that employees have the right skills. Formal Government intervention can help at basic skill levels, but not beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Swansea, East spoke also about the property market. As a matter of economic management, one might say that it was undesirable for property prices to rise and fall as they did. We heard from the hon. Member for Caerphilly about the importance of the construction industry to job creation and to the economy generally. As we all know, the housing market is affected by a supply-side restraint in the form of town and country planning. We all approve of that on environmental grounds, but it is undoubtedly destabilising because it pushes up the price of land. No doubt, we shall be told that at the height of the boom, the price of land in Wokingham went up to an absolutely fantastic figure per acre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the next proposition. The Government can employ supply side measures to improve skills, but what is really being suggested by the hon. Member for Caerphilly when he speaks of a policy of mass employment? There is, of course, a European way of achieving that end. Were the socialists in Europe to come to complete power, it would certainly be possible to impose minimum wages, 35-hour weeks and job sharing. However, there would be two consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the number of jobs in the public sector would no doubt increase, because that is what people of that persuasion want to happen. Secondly, however, the effect of increasing labour costs by making it impossible to employ people for more than 35 hours a week would cause the price of goods to rise. The basic fact is that, if one puts up the cost of something, people have less to spend on it because they must pay more. Artificially to drive up the cost of labour beyond that which the market can support has the inevitable consequence that the private sector will cause unemployment. That is the natural consequence of a rise in the price of labour. It is easy in the public sector to take up some of those jobs—such as the 100 extra
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I followed the hon. Gentleman's simplistic description of the cost of labour and the amount of labour that can be afforded, but will he explain how this country is to compete with developing, third world countries—such as southern China—where the cost of labour may be one tenth of that here? How can we compete with those countries if we do not develop skills through public investment in training, to enable us to employ people at high wage rates to make high-value goods? Without that investment, competition with countries such as China will bring our work force to penury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting and important observation. Everybody buys Japanese or Taiwanese computers and electrical goods whose cost has fallen substantially in recent years. Our standard and convenience of living have been much improved as a result, and wealth has been created by a free open market in which we can buy Japanese and Taiwanese goods cheaply. The Apricot computer company's bold attempt to maintain a British hardware manufacturing business did not succeed. ACT is now purely a software house and Apricot hardware is now part of the Japanese manufacturing concern.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for straying, Mr. Hughes. To answer the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones), ultimately wealth is created by the skills and abilities of firms and individuals. Government simply takes that wealth away in the form of taxation. Occasionally, Government can spend money on training in basics, but ultimately the matter is more complicated and lies beyond the Government's capacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying about the Government simply taking money away from the private sector. However, does he not accept the basic premise that a large portion of public spending finds its way back to the private sector in some shape or form? If a house building programme were undertaken, I do not expect that the public sector would make the bricks, roof slates, paint or electrical cables. That would be for the private sector. Public spending creates jobs in the private sector. The hon. Gentleman does himself a disservice by not recognising that</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that, but the value of the idea that one can operate some kind of Keynesian multiplier effect by recycling money through the coffers of the Inland Revenue has been grossly exaggerated. The court at Versailles gave spectacular employment opportunities for Sevres porcelain but did it really add to the glory or greater wealth of France? Clearly not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty that the hon. Member for Caerphilly did not address in his critique was that the revolution of
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
the 1980s—the abolition of exchange controls, floating exchange rates and the constitutional restraints of the European Community, will mean that we shall operate within an international economy in a way that we have not done since 1914. The attempts and false promises of socialism somehow to run a contained national economy have simply vanished in the wind as freedom has overswept the western world. That means that the type of arrangement so glorified in 1977—those negative interest rates which robbed British savings—are no longer an option for the Chancellor of the Exchequer as he considers the implications of the Budget for Wales or for anywhere else. We must deal with them on the basis of what has to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard a paean to Wokingham and comparisons with the problems of Welsh constituencies. What the hon. Member for Caerphilly did not draw out is the past 25 years of the history of Berkshire. There was a time in the late 1960s when Reading could properly be described as a grubby railway town which had failed economically, and Wokingham was merely a suburb somewhere to the south-east of it. In the 1960s, Newbury was a failed agricultural market town. The hon. Gentleman seems surprised. Surely he has been stuck at Swindon and has noticed that Swindon was a class 1 disaster in terms of its economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is going wide of the mark. He must return to the subject of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, Mr. Hughes—in this way, if I am in order the best public investment for Wales in the past, which the Budget builds upon, was the construction of the Severn bridge and the M4 corridor. The great wave of prosperity which, of course, receded because of the trade cycle, is a continuing wave which, when the economy continues its recovery, will bring greater prosperity, especially to south-east Wales. There is no doubt that the problems in valley communities, which face the difficulties of economic adjustment, are much greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much about expenditure cuts. I recall the time of funny money—something much beloved of the Treasury under the last Labour Government—when measurement was not in terms of pounds and pence but in terms of expectations, proofed for inflation, of previous expenditure. Labour always made sure that expenditure went up—a system which, happily, had to be abandoned as nothing short of a scandal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real test of the mettle and success of my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor can be seen plainly on page 117 of the Red Book, which shows that in the battle for what Wales needs, and can get, he has been extremely successful. The figures for the controlled total per Department of estimated outturn for 1993––94 are £6,330,000, and for 1994–95 £6,650,000. That last figure showed the £320 million that my right hon. and learned Friend mentioned.

In Wales, as in Scotland, there is a unique multifunctional Department. The table shows substantial pound cuts in the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment [

	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
an extremely successful job for Wales in arguing his comer in the Government. I welcome that, and I welcome the fact that it will continue to be the policy of the Welsh Office to do what can properly be done by the Government to promote prosperity. Those who believe that, somehow or another, by fiscal budgetary means, one can work magic, are simply not living in a coherent economic world where wealth and prosperity are not simple gifts from the trees but are the hard-won consequence of hard work, effort and enterprise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall address some of the issues that were posed by the hon. Gentleman rather than answer him straight away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put the Budget to a simple test. How does it match the needs of the communities that I represent? What has it done to promote the prosperity of communities such as mine? We are fortunate that, at the time of the Budget, We have had the best and most objective assessment of what has happened to the valleys' economy in the past five years. If the Secretary of State is happy to agree, I propose that, instead of continuing a sterile debate on what has or has not been achieved by the valleys initiative, we should accept the two objective assessments made by his Department—the good and the bad points. If we accept that and then discuss where we go from there, I think that it would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two documents demonstrate the many good things that came out of the valleys initiative: infrastructure changes, the raising of the image and profile of our valleys communities and much of the urban investment money that went into the initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The initiative is helping gradually to remove the historic inhibitions to companies bringing jobs into the area as a result of the changes in land reclamation schemes. I have said openly, from day one, that that is an important part of the valleys initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Government's figures that show that we have had 12,000 new jobs in manufacturing There are 73 new plants, which have created 4,600 new jobs. Those jobs are invaluable and an important part of the growing diversity of the valleys' economy. Unfortunately, the down side has been rather greater—I do not say that, the right hon. Gentleman's own Department's report says that. In manufacturing jobs, 183 companies have closed, losing 8,600 jobs. There are 205 manufacturing companies in the valleys communities that have shed another 9,800 jobs. There have been 18,400 jobs lost in the manufacturing sector in the five years that we are discussing against the 12,000 jobs created. Using simple arithmetic, the resulting figure is a negative. I have no joy in that figure, I do not preach gloom; I am simply stating a factual account of what is happening from the Government's figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, 25,000 mining jobs on top of the manufacturing jobs have gone in south Wales in the 1980s. We have been right, from very early days, to draw the Secretary of State's attention to the jobs chasm—the losses versus the gains. Any Budget measures should address those problems and that assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The following figures are not subjective assessments by the likes of me and other hon. Members who represent the communities, but are the Government's interesting assessment of the five years of the valleys initiative.
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
What does it say? Employment—as opposed to unemployment—in the valleys areas in the past five years has fallen by 3 per cent., whereas it increased by 4 per cent. in Wales as a whole. That is a serious loss of employment. Imagine the number of people that we are discussing, whose jobs and purchasing power are not there in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wage levels—particularly male wage levels—have fallen. The disparity between our levels of men at work and those in the United Kingdom has grown, not closed, in the past five years of the valleys initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most serious problem is stated not by me, doom and gloom Rowlands, but in the Government's report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Unemployment amongst men is still unacceptably high and has increased during the Programme period from 17.8 per cent. in June 1988 to 19.8 per cent. in June 1993."</p></blockquote>
The document then states about the five years of the valleys initiative—and this is why I want to ask the Secretary of State if he drew it to the attention of the Cabinet—
	<br><blockquote><p>"One measure, the overall position for the male unemployed, has not improved—an unemployed male is as likely to have been out of work for over 6 months as in 1988."</p></blockquote>
In other words, long-term unemployment—unemployment lasting more than six months—is as bad now in the valleys as it was at the beginning of the valleys initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Did the Secretary of State carry that statement to the Cabinet when he sat at the corner of the Cabinet table and accepted the Chancellor's decision to cut unemployment benefit for people out of work for more than six months? What a petty, mean, nasty thing to do. Does the right hon. Gentleman believe that people who are out of work want to be out of work? The vast majority of the men described in his report as being just as likely to remain out of work more than six months as they would have been at the beginning of the valleys initiative, will now be penalised for the Government's incompetence and mismanagement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State also intends to attack benefits. I find no joy at all in the saddest, most ironic consequence of events in the 1980s, which has meant that our community—Merthyr Tydfil, Rhymney, Cynon, parts of Caerphilly—has become much more dependent upon benefit. One of the astonishing consequences of Thatcherism—with all its buzz words about enterprise, the puritanical work ethic, getting on with it and not depending upon the state—and of the Government's management of our economic affairs in the past 14 years is that more people are now dependent on the state than at any time since the 1930s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion that, somehow, we rather revel in our dependence was peddled around the Tory conference by right wingers. The burden of speech after speech by the Secretary of State for Social Security is that we revel in the idea of invalidity benefit and unemployment; that we do not want or like work That is the image which has been created. It is a hateful thing for our society to become more dependent upon the state. I do not want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The content of yesterday's Budget is what we fear most. Sooner or later Governments remove the props upon which we have become dependent. They take away the potential purchasing power of benefits—and there is none greater than that of invalidity benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If what the hon. Gentleman says is right—and I accept it—surely he should be supporting measures that encourage people back into employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will be able to confirm that two thirds of those who are in receipt of unemployment benefit manage to obtain employment within the six-month period that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe in every possible measure to encourage people back into jobs, but I do not believe that we should penalise those who have not succeeded to do that. That is what the Secretary of State for Wales will do if he votes for this nonsense. I just quoted a figure from his own Department's report to the effect that the rate of long-term unemployment—unemployment lasting more than six months—has remained as high as it was five years ago. The Secretary of State stood by and watched the people concerned being penalised by the Chancellor in the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out to the Secretary of State that one of the curious qualities of this recession and of the working of our society is that often, against all odds, we have managed to sustain purchasing power. If one goes to Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, as the right hon. Gentleman has done, it is not in the same impoverished state as it was in the 1930s. Three factors have made the difference between the styles of recessions of the 1930s and 1980s. A generation of people in the communities that I represent, has had reasonably regular, if not well paid employment for up to 40 years. They have accrued occupational pension rights, and rights to a copper handshake at least, if they are made redundant. Also, people in their mid-50s with various kinds of illness, have received benefits—for which they have made contributions. That combination has meant that there has been additional purchasing power in the community at a time of high unemployment and low economic activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Forty per cent. of the men of working age are inactive throughout the heads of the valley communities, but they have not dropped out of the economic activity of our community. A certain amount of money has been recycled through a combination of redundancy, pensions and benefits. If the right hon. Gentleman takes away a prop as significant as contributory invalidity allowances, he will add to the decline and impoverishment of society. In addition, the growing casualisation of work—everything out to contract and everything short term—means that another great post-war benefit will be destroyed. I refer not to the welfare state, but to the idea that men and, increasingly, women, should have a regular job and create rights for themselves in terms of benefit, so that they become less dependent on the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conducting a study of south Wales in the 1930s. The one simple difference between the 1930s and post-war south Wales has been the concept of reasonably regular employment, accompanied by rights. If the work force is increasingly casualised and patterns of irregular work are created; and if, at the same time, the props—the benefits that have been available—are removed, a society such as ours will be severely impoverished. The 1980s were bad enough, but the 1990s could be much worse unless jobs can be created and people given employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Monmouth spent most of his time attacking the very idea that that could be done, but I believe that it can, and that there is a role for
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Government and state in doing it. There are two ways, one of which is through training. I point out to the hon. Gentleman and to the Secretary of State that the Government have spent large sums on training since the early 1980s, but have precious little to show for it. Much of the training became little more than workfare programmes. However modest and valuable such community action programmes were, they gave training a dirty name. We must once more whet people's appetite for genuine training of the sort represented by modern manufacturing training schemes, such as that which the right hon. Gentleman came to see on Monday, and by modern apprenticeship schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some ideas about how to create a modern apprenticeship. We do not want to go back to the old-fashioned five-year period. Two to three years would be sufficient. We should, however, go back to a form of indenture—a form of agreement so that both employer and trainee know that the relationship will survive for the two to three year period, and will not suddenly be terminated by a change in TEC funding. The funding arrangements must underpin a direct contractual relationship between employer and trainee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not Government but industry that has failed in training. Hoover had a fantastic training plant, but closed it down. The British Steel Corporation plant in Dowlais has been shut down. The great trainers in the valley communities were the great nationalised industries, but they have all shut down. Privatisation has coincided with the closure of all the training programmes that those organisations provided. That was an alternative vocational education system in our society. It has all gone, and we must substantially recreate it to provide modern apprenticeships.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An evaluation by Welsh Office consultants points out that of the 73 new companies that have created 4,600 jobs, only 20 per cent. of the purchasing by those companies is local. What if we could turn that 20 per cent. into 40 per cent? Despite the global nature of industry, we have on our doorstep and stretching along the M4 large assembly plants. If we could turn only a percentage of the purchasing power of those plants into indigenous jobs or other forms of inward investment, the potential for valuable jobs in engineering manufacturing would open up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
I want to make a simple point: there are potential jobs to be had. We need training of the kind and character that I tried to describe and I think that that will be delivered by the Secretary of State in one way or another. In the meantime, it would be wicked and wrong to penalise the poor, the unemployed and invalids. It is unclear exactly what the Government intend to do. There are 28,000 people in receipt of contributed invalidity allowance and benefit in Merthyr Tydfil, Rhymney and the Cynon Valley. Will they be put through the test that was described in the Government's recent social security memorandum? I shall read that test to the Secretary of State and ask him if that is what the scheme is all about Those who would not now qualify for invalidity allowance or benefit include
	<br><blockquote><p>"A retired builder with heart disease who has angina pectoris … gets pain in the chest after excessive bending, heavy lifting and carrying. He is unable to walk on the flat more than 200 yards at any one time before he has to stop because of chest pain. He has to climb the stairs slowly."</p></blockquote>
According to the Government's social security memorandum that person, who at present qualifies for invalidity benefit would not qualify under the new incapacity test. Is the Secretary of State endorsing that? Will he subject people in our society to that test?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Department memorandum stands, those who would be excluded from receiving benefit would also include
	<br><blockquote><p>"A 58 year-old teacher retired prematurely on health grounds because of chronic indigestion due to a peptic ulcer. This has now responded to treatment except for acute exacerbations every 1/2 months which last 5 days at a time. He/she continues to attend hospital and says there is a likelihood of surgery."</p></blockquote>
None of us wants to live in a dependent society. I am fed up with it. I am fed up with having to represent a community which I have watched decline in some respects but which has also done much to try to regenerate itself. The sum total of all the efforts of the past 14 or 15 years is that more people are more dependent on the state than before the war as a result of Government policies. The Secretary of State, the Ministers and their colleagues have no right to visit their failures on our communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a good debate. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney for his eloquent speech describing the effect of the Budget on his community. Many Opposition Members share his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be churlish to deny that some parts of the Budget are welcome—I welcome three measures in particular first, those designed to help small businesses. Small businesses make a valuable contribution to job creation—especially in rural areas—so I am sure that they will welcome the changes in the audit requirements as well as the enterprise investment scheme and the understanding that the Government are consulting on the issue of late payments. I am not sure why the Government could not have come forward with a firm proposal—yesterday, the Chancellor spoke of two possible alternatives. The Government have had sufficient time to think about it and at least we can now hope that a scheme will be introduced in the not too distant future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
There is also a welcome addition to the home energy efficiency scheme. Opposition Members have argued for some time that it is far more efficient to insulate homes and, therefore, to protect the environment than to impose VAT on fuel. We have always believed that to be the right approach. We welcome the increase and believe that the Government should go further. They should seriously consider the provisions of the Bill introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that I hope that the Government will take on board the provisions of that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also welcome the announcement on child care allowance which is important because it will help many lone parents and young families to return to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Secretary of State about the proposal for private investment in the west coast main line. He was unable to answer that directly today, but I hope that he will be able to argue with his colleagues in the Department of Transport that north Wales should be included in the west coast mainline improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having welcomed those measures, there are issues on which we must challenge the Government. Wales needed a Budget for jobs. We agree with the hon. Member for Caerphilly—the Budget leaves Wales short on that. There is a dangerous fault line in the Budget that may impact on programmes in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor told us yesterday that he aimed to sort out public finances by reducing public spending by £10 billion over three years and by introducing tax increases. But he failed to answer the big question—and the hon. Member for Monmouth could not answer it today—of where the cut in public spending will come from. The table in the Red Book, to which the hon. Member for Monmouth referred, shows that the cut in public expenditure for 1994–95 will be £3.6 billion and that the cut in the reserve will be £3.5 billion. Where will those cuts impact? What happens if, in 1994–95, the projected reserves are not available? What budgets will suffer? If the Chancellor is to meet his targets, he must make cuts in another Department. We fear that there may be a hidden agenda for Wales. We need to be told which Departments will suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor told us that the Budget projections on growth are pessimistic but that they are only projections. What happens if his projections are not borne out? Will he ask for more cuts in public expenditure? Where will those impact? To tell us that public expenditure is going to be cut is simply a crude accounting device. The two figures highlighted in the Red Book for substantial cuts are not under departmental headings; they are to come from the reserves and the European Community. We do not know what spending will be cut from those categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also believe that for Wales the acid test of the Budget is whether it will create jobs by stimulating growth in employment Like the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, we are concerned about employment both in rural Wales and in the valleys of south Wales—areas
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
in which the economy is extremely weak and fragile. We have referred to unemployment blackspots. The way in which the block grant in Wales is to be allocated gives an idea of the way in which the Government might tackle the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The press release issued by the Welsh Office to accompany the Budget papers gives a global sum but does not tell us how that sum will be allocated between the various heads. I assume that the Secretary of State will be able to tell us that in the next couple of days. The Chancellor gave us an indication of how that will be approached by Departments in England. If we consider the projected cuts in the transport and housing budgets, we see that those areas in which public sector jobs could be created will be cut. If that is an indication of what will happen in Wales, it will have a deleterious effect on job prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put several matters to the Secretary of State relating to areas in which public spending in Wales can assist job prospects. I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Monmouth who referred to the M4, which was built with public money. The hon. Gentleman told us that jobs were being created as a result. That is precisely what we have been arguing for. It is clear that the use of public money for infrastructure projects creates jobs. The use of public money in Wales, in addition to European Community funding, has gone a long way towards creating the M4 corridor, to which the hon. Gentleman referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, there have been improvements to the A5 across the island. The Secretary of State knows that transport to the port of Holyhead is vital in order to create a better economic base for north-west Wales. The date for those improvements should be brought forward. That would create jobs and improve economic performance in that part of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also need to invest in the railways—an issue I have raised with the Secretary of State. If there were proper investment in the north and south Wales main lines to upgrade and eventually to electrify them, that part of Wales would not only be able to compete much more effectively in the new context, but would be able to meet head on the challenge of the single market and the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also consider spending on housing. Yesterday, the Chancellor was modest in his projections for housing in England. How modest will the Secretary of State for Wales be? Will he release money for housebuilding in Wales? The projections that we have heard from Tai Cymru—local authorities are no longer allowed to build houses—go nowhere near meeting requirements in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me refer to the requirements of two groups of people. Young, single people have been virtually cut out of the housing market in Wales. That is a major problem. In March, in my constituency, people tell me that they have to leave their winter lets so that properties can be let to people who come for the summer. They move into caravans, where they remain for part of the year before they return to winter lets. We must create a proper housing policy, whereby young, single people are given the opportunity to have their own homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem of young, married people in rural Wales whose incomes are substantially lower than
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
those of people in any other part of the United Kingdom, but whom property inflation has prevented from entering the housing market at all. Between 1988 and 1990, housing inflation in my constituency resulted in house prices doubling, which means that young people cannot possibly obtain mortgage facilities to buy their own homes. I should like the Government to tackle that problem, and to allow housing associations and others—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman think that the best way to address that problem is to follow the recommendations of the Welsh Affairs Committee in relation to use of the planning process, rather than by additional Government subsidy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ultimately, the bottom line is what a young couple can afford. The average joint income of young married couples in my constituency is between £8,000 and £10,000. The hon. Gentleman will know from his previous professional experience what sort of mortgage those people can afford. It is simply impossible to buy a house for £50,000 or £60,000. Young people need to be helped to enter the housing market. That would solve two problems. It would begin to get unemployed people in the construction industry back to work and would give young people an opportunity to have their first home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a massive philosophical and ideological difference between the Government's approach to the Budget and what the people of Wales want. There is a big gap. Wales has a political tradition which values community ties and enables people to provide emotional support to others in times of stress and to protect the weak, the vulnerable and the sick. The Government's economic policies throughout the 1980s sought to dismantle that tradition and replace it with a philosophy based on individual advancement at the expense of community responsibility. That policy failed because the Welsh people constantly rejected it in election after election. There is no way in which we in Wales would have attacked the benefit system as the Government have done by making the unemployed, the sick and the vulnerable scapegoats for the Government's failures. It is almost obscene that the Government have attacked the unemployed and the sick to reduce the Budget deficit instead of looking for money from higher income earners. Their priorities are wrong and we in Wales would not want to pursue such policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney referred eloquently to the attack on invalidity benefit. Why has the number of claimants increased in recent years? I believe that the Government were happy to see the number grow because that meant that the unemployment figures were much lower. People were encouraged to apply for invalidity benefit because they would not then appear in the unemployment figures. Now that the Government have tackled the unemployment benefit to reduce the figures, they are attacking invalidity benefit, making it much more difficult for people who are genuinely incapacitated to obtain the benefits to which they are entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main difference between the two sides of the Committee is the philosophical and political difference between the traditions of south-east England which were apparent in the Budget, and those of Wales. The projections in the Budget refer to 1996. Reference was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
made, for example, to the way in which the economy will be improving by 1996—in time for more tax cuts in readiness for election year. The real purpose of the Budget was not to create jobs in Wales but to protect Tory skins in 1996.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had great difficulty in recognising in the speech made by the hon. Member for Caerphilly the Budget that I heard yesterday. I have not heard such doom and gloom since the previous sitting of the Welsh Grand Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State challenged the Labour party to say what it would do for Wales, in the unlikely event of there being a Labour Government, and what has been achieved by the shadow Secretary of State in his negotiations in the shadow Cabinet. Unfortunately, we have received no response to the challenge, so the question must hang in the air and remain unanswered. The only conclusion that we can fairly draw from that silence is that Labour would do nothing for the people of Wales—what a wretched contrast with my right hon. Friend who has fought tooth and nail for Welsh interests at a time when every departmental budget is under threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing the implications of the Budget for Wales and I want to concentrate on that. The hon. Member for Caerphilly claimed that it was not a Budget for jobs. I beg to disagree. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has recognised the framework that is necessary to produce jobs. That is based first and foremost on low inflation and I was delighted on behalf of my constituents that that was not jeopardised in yesterday's Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second priority, and the one that was chiefly addressed yesterday, is the necessary reduction in the PSBR. Opposition Members say that the Government created the problem, so why should the public pay for it? But that misses the point. The reason why the PSBR has risen so alarmingly is because of the length and intractability of the recession. I did not hear any Opposition Members urging us to cut expenditure on health, social services or education while the deficit was mounting. They ducked the problem, as they did when they were last in office in the 1970s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The important point is that 18 months ago, the Government were telling the British people that there would be no need for extra taxation or public expenditure cuts.

	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Britain must export goods to survive—we are one of the greatest trading nations in the world.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our solution is based partly on an increase in taxation, but, more substantially, on a reduction in public spending. I believe that we have the right balance. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was careful not to attack the private sector and prevent it from creating the wealth on which our sustained recovery will be based. He emphasised that private capital would be sought for roadbuilding, housing, and so on. He showed, too, his commitment to small businesses, by raising the VAT threshold substantially, so that they will no longer have to register and will be spared all the paperwork that VAT entails. That will give them a competitive edge for their products and services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I assume that he is also supporting the proposals that the Secretary of State has endorsed in the Red Book for cuts in public spending in Wales in the next few years. Will the hon. Gentleman consult page 118 of the Red Book, which shows that in real terms, spending in Wales will remain constant between the years 1994–95 and 1996–97, which, in effect, means a cut?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sweeney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know which particular item of expenditure the hon. Gentleman has in mind, but all Departments have a duty to take great care with public spending. If they do not, the PSBR will rise rather than fall.

Government, unlike the Labour party which, on its track record, has always considered that the best way of balancing the books is to raise revenue, even when to do so actually reduces the net take from taxation. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor has chosen carefully which taxes to raise and when to raise them in order not to stifle the recovery. That is the balanced approach that I expect from a Conservative government who recognise the long-term need to lower taxes rather than raise them, but who recognise also the overriding current need to reduce the PSBR.

I return to the issue of VAT on domestic fuel. During the general election, Opposition parties paraded a commitment to reducing atmospheric pollution. The Prime Minister went to the Earth summit in Rio and, with 149 other nations, agreed to a target to contain carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 so that they would be no higher than they were in 1990. That target is not too ambitious, but is difficult to achieve. My right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor is trying to tackle that problem. The introduction of VAT on domestic

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the figure mentioned is 150 million tonnes, but I do not know to what extent that has been affected by the concessions in the Budget. We have extended the home energy efficiency policy to encourage people to save fuel. Half a million people have benefited already under that scheme and a quarter of a million more are expected to do so this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
