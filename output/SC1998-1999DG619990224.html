	<div class='legislation'>Draft National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Alun Michael)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999.</p></blockquote>
The order is the remaining piece in a rather large jigsaw. Since the last election, the Government have made it clear that the Assembly will take over the functions of the Secretary of State for Wales and the staff and property that go with his Department. Our purpose has always been to do away with the government of Wales by an unaccountable and unelected hierarchy at the Welsh Office and to replace it with a new and democratic Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware that the formal arrangements for establishing the Assembly are largely in place. The order completes the picture by giving the Assembly the great bulk of its functions. As it reflects our long-standing policy, there are few surprises in it. Every statutory function that I exercise will, with a small handful of exceptions, pass to the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, we are considering a list of functions. Life is, however, never quite that straightforward. It is certainly possible quickly to identify the key functions that I exercise in major policy areas and which the Assembly will need. Beyond that, an exhaustive and painstaking exercise was needed to identify not only the functions that I and the Welsh Office exercise but those that we have not used and on which the Assembly might take a separate view. The result is a broad and comprehensive document, which sets out the powers that will enable the Assembly to meet the expectations of its electorate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, the order contains important functions and I will mention six. First, it transfers to the Assembly a full range of powers and duties in relation to the national health service in Wales under the National Health Service Act 1977, the NHS and Community Care Act 1990 and other health statutes. Secondly, the Education Reform Act 1988 and later education Acts give the Assembly similarly broad powers over all aspects of education in Wales. Thirdly, the Welsh Development Agency Act 1975, the Industrial Development Act 1982 and several other Acts give the Assembly powers to support the Welsh economy and to improve job creation. Fourthly, the Environment Act 1995 and a host of other environmental statutes contain powers that make the Assembly the guardian of the environment in Wales. Fifthly, the Highways Act 1980 gives the Assembly full control of the trunk road network in Wales. Sixthly,
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
the Agriculture Act 1967 and many other agricultural Acts will allow the Assembly to take charge of agricultural matters in Wales and tackle the problems that rural areas face. Alongside those powers are many others in the same and other important areas, such as housing, planning and local government. For brevity, I will not dwell on them all now, but I will be happy to answer questions, particularly when I close the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State is correct in saying that the list of functions is rather long. Given that there are so many functions, I find it amusing that he said, "I'll pick six." I want, however, to ask two questions at the outset. On the national health service, will the Secretary of State for Health consult with the First Secretary or with the Assembly over prescription charges? Could prescription charges in Wales be levied at a different rate from those in the rest of the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I mentioned six major areas. As I said, the national health service is a broad area, and there is a considerable amount of legislation covering it, which is drawn together in the list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be for the Assembly to make arrangements on consultation. In some circumstances, they might involve the First Secretary and in others, they might involve an individual Assembly Secretary holding particular responsibilities. Equally, they might be administrative. That will depend to some extent on the arrangements that the Assembly puts in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Welsh, I apologise to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, but I cannot hear him. I could sit on the other side of the Committee, but I do not want to do so. Will my right hon. Friend please speak up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would prefer my hon. Friend to examine the minutiae of devolved legislation from my side of the Room. I know whom it is wise to have on the same side rather than to be against. I shall try to speak a little louder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have outlined the consultation arrangements. The Assembly will set prescription charges, under section 77 of the National Health Service Act 1977, whose powers are transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make one point in response to the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) and I shall do so once rather than on various occasions. The Assembly must have regard in making its decisions for what happens elsewhere. Sometimes it will want to make decisions that differ from those made elsewhere because circumstances in Wales are different. It will not take such decisions arbitrarily, but because they suit Welsh needs. In other circumstances, the Assembly will need to be very conscious of arrangements on the other side of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in the presence of a Scottish Chairman, so I should remind the Committee that the distance between the centres of population in Wales and those in England is minimal, while Scotland is rather different. That proximity will affect the Assembly's thinking and decision making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that my question was detailed, and I am grateful for the Secretary of State's response—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bridgend)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: See page 230.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that comment. If the hon. Gentleman—a former Minister—had shouted it out earlier, perhaps the answer would have come a bit quicker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Differentials in taxation are important and I hear what the Secretary of State says about the Assembly having to consider prescription charges elsewhere. He referred also to the fact that reducing such charges would mean money having to come from within the Assembly's own budget, so priorities would have to be different. The point is that that happens now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, I was lobbied by road hauliers about the differential in diesel prices, which are 30 per cent. higher in Britain than in Calais. People are filling up in Calais, but doing their business here. Greater differences between the Assembly's decisions and those made in England, for example, could result in a similar outcome. If such a difference were to open up wide, the strain on the Welsh budget would be much greater.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was a long intervention—I want only short interventions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take notice of that remark, Mr. Welsh, and make my reply short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have pointed out why the circumstances about which the hon. Member for Ribble Valley spoke could not arise. There must be a good relationship between the Assembly, its decision makers, the Secretaries in the Assembly and Ministers in Whitehall, both at official and elected level. That should ensure what the legislation is all about—devolution. It is not about separatism or moving Wales off coast. It is about Wales being able to take appropriate decisions in an intelligent manner, in cognisance of its own interests and its relationship with other parts of the United Kingdom. I am confident that the fears expressed by the hon. Gentleman are misplaced because of the arrangements that the Assembly will follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may help the Committee if I outline how the order works. For the most part, the transfer of functions is straightforward. Where I am able to exercise a function now, the Assembly will be able to do so. An unqualified provision in the order means that the Assembly will have sole responsibility in Wales for the relevant functions after 1 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, legislation requires the Secretary of State to act jointly with other Ministers in exercising specific functions. For other functions, I have to seek the Treasury's consent before acting. As an elected body, the Assembly will be accountable to the people of Wales so, where possible, we have removed requirements for joint action and for Treasury consent. That point was decided by Parliament in paragraph 9 of schedule 3 of the Government of Wales Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
In a few instances, however, it would not be prudent to make such changes. For example, the Assembly could not sensibly make separate decisions about bodies that serve the whole of Great Britain, such as the Meat and Livestock Commission. In those cases, the order transfers to the Assembly only my share of a joint function, leaving it to act jointly with the other Minister concerned. For example, appointments to the Meat and Livestock Commission will be made jointly by the Assembly, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the appropriate Minister in the Scottish Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of important related issues in Wales. For example, the Ministry of Defence owns 32,000 acres in my constituency. I doubt whether the Secretary of State for Wales has any functions allied with defence and yet what happens there is of great concern within Wales. How would he treat an instance of that kind within the transfer of functions that is before us today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those matters are made clear in the order—I recall seeing a point about liaison with the Ministry of Defence on environmental issues. The current arrangements by which liaison takes place between Ministers and Departments will be followed in the devolved area by consultation with the Assembly by the Ministry of Defence. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the situation is covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may just finish this point: In terms of the arrangements that remain jointly with the Treasury, the Assembly will only need the Treasury's consent for the form of public accounts and matters relating to public sector pensions, borrowing in foreign currency and certain statutory fees. Those are matters which are wholly or partly outside the Welsh block.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution does not mean separation. United Kingdom Departments will still need to act in Wales on many matters that are not to be transferred to the Assembly—for example, social security, broadcasting and prisons. Furthermore, UK Ministers will still need to exercise some functions alongside the Assembly, and in those cases the order makes the functions concurrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some areas are not referred to in the order because they will be dealt with by concordats, which are being developed between the Welsh Office and other Government Departments in preparation for the Assembly. Those relationships will, I believe, be productive and positive. They are necessary so as to ensure that Wales is not deprived of UK or Great Britain-wide programmes. For instance, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment is reponsible for the Employment Service in Wales and will remain so. However, my Department also operates a range of training and guidance services, which rely on the same statutory authority—in that case, section 2 of the Employment and Training Act 1973. The order thus provides for that function to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
concurrent. Both my right hon. Friend and the Assembly will be able to exercise it in Wales, but neither will need the consent of the other to do so. Those types of co-operative arrangements will not cause a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important and useful point. In the case of the new deal, where my right hon. Friend's Under-Secretary of State tries to deliver the new deal in Wales and the director of employment services in Wales serves him, is there already a concordat between the Welsh Office and the Department for Education and Employment in the operation of the Department's regional services?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is yes. I met the advisory committee to discuss the operation of the new deal in relation to young people in Wales, particularly those at greatest risk, specifically because there is a link between the work of the Employment Service, the operation of the new deal and other priorities within the policies for which the Welsh Office has responsibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the nature and character of the concordat. If a copy of it is in existence, can we see it so that we can judge what kind of a model it is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment, those matters are dealt with between Ministers and there is therefore no need for the formality that is required by the formation of a new body such as the Assembly and its Ministries. We are following the best practice of the arrangements that currently exist by formalising them and making them more open to scrutiny, as many other things will be as a direct result of the Assembly coming into being. I assure my hon. Friend that the specific understanding of the operation of concordats that he seeks will be facilitated by their scrutiny by interested Members of Parliament and Assembly Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it be possible in future for the concordats to be more structured, when they are between the Assembly and Westminster? Will the concordats be open to judicial review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that they will not be open to judicial review, because they are arrangements within government. I can give the hon. Gentleman more detailed response later, if he wants. The arrangements are intended to facilitate the machinery of government, and I hope that they will do so in a constructive and positive manner. They will not change the actual responsibilities of the respective Departments or of the Assembly, which I think is the sort of matter subject to judicial review; they are arrangements about how powers will be exercised by the respective bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Elfyn Llwyd 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meirionnydd Nant Conwy)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State referred earlier to the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
National Assembly for Wales having co-responsibility, neither relying on the other's consent to introduce a certain policy. What happens if at some point they are at loggerheads? Who will take precedence in such a situation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me answer that question directly. In theory, because of the concurrence of powers, it will be open to the Assembly to set up its own employment service. However, the resources lie with the Department for Education and Employment. It would therefore be very odd for the Welsh Office to seek to operate in that way. In practice, there will be good relationships and close working—as there is at present—between the Welsh Office and the DfEE. It is not a problem at present; and I do not believe that it will be a problem in future, because I believe that the Assembly will be a positive and forward-looking organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, duplication is theoretically possible; in practice, it is highly unlikely in elements, such as the Employment Service, for which the DfEE takes responsibility. I understand the point made by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd), but that is more of a possibility than a real problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now that the Assembly will be a reality, we wish it well—[Hon. Members: "Oh!"] No, we wish it to succeed for the people of Wales. However, the point made by the hon,. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy is true. If there is a problem in future, is there an arrangement whereby the Secretary of State would have precedence over the First Secretary, or would that have to be resolved in some other way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where there is a power for both to exercise—as in the example raised—there is no legal system of resolution; however, there is a system through the concordats and arrangements. It is not the law but good relations and administration on which we depend for that. It should be understood that an awful lot of government depends on good relationships and understandings. The concordats are meant to formalise the necessary arrangements to ensure that we have practical guidance for the operation of the machinery of government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious that I must press on, as I know that many hon. Members will wish to speak. I should at this point say something about the most complex provisions in the order: those relating to water. As we recognised in the White Paper, "A Voice for Wales", water policy requires special treatment under devolution. Rivers do not respect the border between England and Wales; nor do water companies. The order makes special provision for many functions under the Water Industry Act 1991 and the Water Resources Act 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Water Industry Act 1991 contains the great majority of powers regulating the water industry. The order gives the Assembly powers as regards Dŵr Cymru, and allows my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions to retain them as regards Severn Trent. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
reflects the respective roles of the Welsh Office and of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, we are building on what has worked in practice. That means that the Assembly will have jurisdiction over Dŵr Cymru's operations in Herefordshire and Cheshire, while my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions oversees the Severn Trent's activities in Montgomeryshire. That is the only sensible way to proceed. It would be nonsense for one undertaker to be subject to oversight from two different authorities. Again, I think that any problems will be dealt with by good will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Livsey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will that also apply to the water that is being transferred from the Elan valley to the Severn Trent authority? That agreement was struck some four or five years ago by Dŵr Cymru. A lot of water is being transferred within Wales from the Dŵr Cymru area to the Severn Trent area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take advice on that point, but I believe that the whole of Dŵr Cymru's operations come under the regulation of the Welsh Office. Where there is an interface between the two, it will be a question of which is the primary organisation. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that there is no problem at present, nor has one arisen. We are reflecting in the responsibilities of the Assembly and the relevant Ministry what happens at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Water Resources Act 1991 contains comprehensive powers to safeguard and manage water resources. The Assembly will need these for Wales; they are a key part of its wider environmental responsibilities. But it will need to recognise that some of its decisions with regard to the rivers Dee, Severn and Wye and their tributaries can easily have an effect on England. For instance, if the Assembly were to authorise discharges into one of those rivers, it would affect water quality on the English side of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Assembly will act responsibly in this respect, taking into account English views and needs before acting. I hope to establish informal means of resolving any disputes by concordat. However, in extreme cases, we need to ensure that the Assembly does not cause serious damage to English interests; that has no place in a sensible scheme of devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will retain a reserve power to intervene where there is a risk of such damage and to exercise the function himself. In doing so, he will also have to act reasonably. The order lists the functions to which the reserve power is to apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many instances of the reserve power are there in the transfer of functions to the National Assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very few. I am drawing attention to a specific power because in general, as I said at the beginning, the power transfers either wholly in part. For instance, a joint power between the Secretary of State for Wales and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will continue to be exercised
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
jointly but by the Assembly and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. That is not reserving the power, but exercising it jointly. Reserve powers are being kept to an absolute minimum. That is why I am drawing attention to specific powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But how many are there in the whole transfer process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Few. I have read every line of the transfer process, but I cannot say that I kept a calculator on one side and added them up. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with the precise number, which I know is not large. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] In fact, I am told, with the speed of light, that only some functions under the Water Resources Act—the area that I have been talking about—are affected. That is some 35 powers out of 5,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So somebody has read the order line by line. [
	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh yes. I assure the hon. Gentleman that this is not a Maastricht treaty job. I have been through the order and the technical guide line by line, but I do not pretend to have retained every line of those documents. However, I have satisfied myself on the detail of the order before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the right hon. Gentleman for another concrete example of when reserve powers may be used? If the Assembly decided that beef on the bone should be allowed, but the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food decided that it should not, where would the power finally rest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The power in Wales would lie with the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), who I am pleased to see in Committee, and very close to the end of the document, assured the House on 22 July last year that the Assembly would have sole control over the construction and enlargement of reservoirs in Wales. The order fully discharges that assurance. In no circumstances will a United Kingdom Minister be able to authorise such works. That will be a matter for the Assembly alone. I suspect that that may provide the reassurance, by a different route, that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Livsey) was seeking a few moments ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose that the order should come into force on 1 July this year. That is the date on which the Assembly will acquire the great bulk of its functions and it is the same day on which the Scottish Parliament will acquire its powers. The choice of that date reflects the urgency with which we want to establish the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that a lead-in time of seven weeks is very short when compared with the 11 months that was allowed at the time of the local government reorganisation. However, hon. Members will appreciate that the date must be at the beginning of a month because the Welsh Office's management accounting system, like most others, operates on a monthly basis. Attempting to transfer responsibility for public expenditure to the Assembly mid-month
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
would risk making it impossible to account properly for expenditure. Both sets of accounts could be called into question and inadequate information would be available to auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that the Assembly's own structures are fully in place when its functions are conferred upon it. Following the elections, all Members of the Assembly will need to be sworn in and the Assembly will have to hold its own elections. The First Secretary will have to choose his or her Cabinet, following which the Assembly must establish its system of subject Committees. The Assembly itself will have to put in place the new arrangements, so a transfer of functions on 1st June would not be sensible. However, I do not want the Assembly to have to wait until August or beyond to begin its work in earnest, although it will undoubtedly begin to consider and debate matters before the transfer of functions on 1 July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is at the heart of the new government of Wales. It gives the Assembly comprehensive powers to improve public services, the economy and the environment and to do so solely on the basis of its democratic mandate. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Evans 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ribble Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is appropriate that you, Mr. Welsh, are chairing this Committee; I am sure that much thought went into your selection. We welcome you to the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by deploring the fact that the Committee is sitting for only an hour and a half. I am sure that all Committee members appreciate the wealth and depth of information that is involved in this transfer of powers. We cannot do justice to the order in just an hour and a half. It was noted yesterday in a different Statutory Instrument Committee that when the Welsh Assembly is established, it will at least be able to give a lot more debate and scrutiny to the sort of powers that we are discussing today. I wish it well in that. It is starting with a blank sheet of paper. With some of the hon. Members who will transfer from this House to the Welsh Assembly, I hope that it will be able to give much more scrutiny to such matters than we can now. We should consider increasing parliamentary scrutiny in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refute that totally. The hon. Gentleman is wrong. Three drafts of the order were sent to the Members for all the Welsh constituencies—and the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) and the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)—in January, May and November last year. The drafts were for consultation and comments were invited from all interested parties, including hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To date, I have had no substantive comments from any Member of the House and certainly none from the Opposition, so I am surprised that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley complains. There has been an extensive period of consultation; that he has not taken part in it is his problem, not mine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not take any lectures on democracy from the Secretary of State for Wales, particularly after last Saturday's sham, when even the members of the Labour party in Wales were not allowed to say democratically who should lead them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not dispute the fact that draft copies were sent out, but Members of Parliament view this Committee as the chance to have their say on the order. I merely note that the one and a half hours that has been allotted is inadequate. I intend to move on so that other hon. Members will be able to have their say, but Parliament as a whole ought to consider how the scrutiny of such matters might be improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Secretary of State's attitude reflects the Government's whole approach to Parliament? They believe that they achieve sufficient parliamentary scrutiny simply by passing documents around. Real discussion in which people can get to grips with the issues—the whole purpose of Parliament—is sidelined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally agree that we need to reflect fully on what constitutes the proper scrutiny of information; more scrutinising work is done in Committees such as ours than occurs even on the Floor of the House. The House should re-examine the way in which we scrutinise these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will take no lectures on democracy from the hon. Gentleman. I understand that it is far easier for him to indulge in a bit of knockabout that is far removed from the truth than to acknowledge that he and his hon. Friends are rejecting the extended opportunity given to them of looking at the detail of the order. The hon. Gentleman has failed to take that responsibility seriously and that is why he seeks to cast a cloud of confusion over our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a great shame that the Secretary of State thinks that an hour and a half is an appropriate amount of time in which to debate and scrutinise the orders. Yet again, he demonstrates the arrogance that 
	<i>The Sun</i> pilloried on its front page this week—it said that this is the most arrogant Cabinet that Britain has ever had. What the Secretary of State has just said proves that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman could explain why his party made no representations through the usual channels about discussing the matter on the Floor of the House. We have processes that allow hon. Members to say that they are not satisfied with matters being taken into Committee—the hon. Gentleman did not take that opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that when he responds, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley will return to discussing the content of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will happily do that, Mr. Welsh. Talk about smokescreens, it would have been amazing if any representations had succeeded in getting the orders discussed on the Floor of the House. I for my part will not take lectures on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Secretary of State will tell his fellow Cabinet and other Ministers, as a result of our proceedings, that we need to look at ways of strengthening the hand of Parliament and of Back Benchers over the Executive. This is not the way to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I shall move on, otherwise our debate will be about nothing more than the inadequacies of the Committee to scrutinise the order. I shall plough on and be brief, because I know that other members of the Committee want to have their say. We have less than an hour left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State mentioned the transfer of powers and property. One property that is excluded is Gwydyr house—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I have a Swansea, not a Lancashire accent. I know that we tend to pronounce things differently in Swansea than in the rest of Wales, but I am grateful for the correction—I take my Welsh lessons wherever I can. Why is no regard being given to the transfer of that property? I am not saying that it should be transferred to the Welsh Assembly, but I would like to know what role it will have and how many people will occupy it. Perhaps part of the building could be let, as a way of at least getting some money in to spend on some essential services that people should receive. The order also states that no documentary or electronic records will be transferred. Has that been properly looked into? Once the Assembly is up and running, will any documents, electronic or otherwise, that could be of use to the Assembly be transferred from the Welsh Office or Gwydyr house?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have mentioned the inconsistencies of the legislation. I have never been a great fan of devolution, athough I wish it well for the sake of the people of Wales. The Conserative representation under Rod Richards will do its best. The Secretary of State for Wales has climbed one of his fences, but he still has several to jump before he gets to the Welsh Assembly. If he is successful, I know that Rod Richards relishes the task of being able to ensure that the people of Wales receive the best services possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have mentioned the transfer of powers dealing with agriculture. I asked about beef on the bone, about which the Secretary of State said that the Assembly will have the final say. The 60 Members of the Welsh Assembly will therefore be able to have their say and allow beef on the bone to be served in Wales, although it will not be served in the rest of the United Kingdom if the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food so decides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As many members of the Committee will know, I served on West Glamorgan county council. While I was a local councillor, Swansea council had the power, and neighbouring Llanelli council decided that
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
"Monty Python's Life of Brian" would not be shown in Llanelli. People therefore went from Llanelli to Swansea to watch it in the Odeon cinema. It was absurd. As a result of the transfer of powers, people from England might be able to cross the bridge for £4.20—if that remains the price—buy their beef on the bone from a butcher in Newport or Cardiff and smuggle it back across the bridge. Or will they be searched as they cross the bridge? Will barriers come up not only to charge them but to allow them to be searched? Obviously, that would be absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State says that it will all work well, that the First Secretary and the Assembly will work with Parliament and the Departments that operate in Westminster, and that everything will be lovey-dovey. I would put an enormous question mark over that. The Secretary of State for Wales and the First Secretary may not be the same person, as the Secretary of State for Wales envisages. He foresees that even if the Prime Minister were to decide on a new Secretary of State for Wales, so that the Secretary of State and the First Secretary are different people, the Assembly would be controlled by the same political party. What will happen in the event of the Assembly being run by a different party, or a coalition of other parties, rather than being held by the same party as is in government in Westminster? Does the Secretary of State genuinely believe that the relationship between the two will be so clear and accommodating? I would put enormous question marks over that, even if the Assembly were run by members of the same political party. The Labour party contains factions, which advocate different directions. The establishment of the Assembly will create genuine problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Llwyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to take the hon. Gentleman back to the beef on the bone example, on which he seems rather stuck. Why is it inappropriate for a country such as Wales to have different policies in some areas from the rest of the United Kingdom? His argument reminds me of one propounded by one of his former colleagues, the lamented former Member for Vale of Glamorgan, Mr. Walter Sweeney. When it was announced that the letter D could be used on a car to indicate "dysgwr", meaning "learner", he said that people coming from England would stop on the motorway and change over when they reached the Severn bridge. As a lawyer, he was reminded that people cannot stop on the motorway for such purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That settles that argument. If Plaid Cymru ever takes Wales into the independence of which the hon. Gentleman no doubt nightly dreams, he may have a stronger argument. Does he genuinely not appreciate the absurdity of people taking the opportunity to enter Wales to buy beef on the bone and bring it back to England if it is banned in England but not in Wales?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has to be a system for the proper negotiation and co-ordination of policy. In Europe, of course, people talk about harmonisation, but we in the United Kingdom cannot call it that; we have to call it the co-ordination of policy because we are so embarrassed by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
it. I am sure that people who read about the transfer of powers in the newspapers at least will realise the absurdity of the fact that it will throw up many anomalies. Beef on the bone is just one. Green top milk is another—it has been given a reprieve, although we do not know for how long. Genetically modified food may be allowed in one part of the United Kingdom but not in another. What attention has been paid to the anomalies that the transfer of powers will throw up time and again?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 2 refers to things that can happen only after consultation with the relevant Secretary of State. What consultation will take place? Will the First Secretary negotiate with a Secretary of State or a Minister in one of the Departments? What will happen if the First Secretary and the Minister or the Secretary of State do not reach an agreement? The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy raised that issue. There is no structure to the provisions—they seem to have been built on the basis that things will work. It is almost as if best conditions will always operate. No thought has been given to the proper flow of government in the transfer of functions. The First Secretary may not agree with a Minister or a Secretary of State. A logjam, an enormous tussle or a power grab could occur in relations between the Welsh Assembly and Departments at Westminster. How will consultations between Westminster and the Welsh Assembly take place not merely in good times but in bad times?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concordats about which we heard are built on the basis that the First Secretary and the Welsh Assembly will always agree with Westminster and the Departments. The Secretary of State gave an example and said that things work well between the Department of Health, the Department for Education and Employment and the Welsh Office. That may well be the case, but there is every reason for Ministers to work with the grain now. When the Welsh Assembly is erected, however, Ministers will—quite rightly—start to look at things that have a Welsh angle with no regard to what is going on in the rest of the United Kingdom. What will happen to a concordat not just in good times but in bad times? Will there be a precedent whereby the Secretary of State for Wales has to use reserve powers to overrule a decision by the First Secretary of the Welsh Assembly? If not, how will the process operate? The Secretary of State said that there would be no judicial review. The Secretary of State for Scotland was asked a question yesterday; he, to, believes that there will be no judicial review. Some legal opinion suggests, however, that people will try to take matters to a court once everything is up and running. Who can say what will happen then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Win Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has given us the prospect of beef on the bone and of bazaars on Offa's dyke. He suggested that the Welsh Assembly will start off with a blank page, yet there are 52 pages to the order and 524 to the guidance—there is nothing blank about them. I was prepared to let go those remarks, but not the hon. Gentleman's remark about
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
the current or the previous Secretary of State for Wales and Welsh Office Ministers operating obliviously to the needs of Wales. By saying that, the hon. Gentleman denigrated previous Secretaries of State from his own party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to answer just one of the hon. Gentleman's questions. There are no city technology colleges in Wales, simply because Lord Roberts has the common sense to realise that they were a no-go scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that Lord Robert's name has been mentioned. I am sure that the Committee wishes him well, as he is recovering in hospital from an operation a few days ago. I am delighted to pass the Committee's good wishes on to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bridgend mentioned my point about the blank sheet of paper. I do not mean a blank sheet of paper regarding the transfer of powers between Westminster and the Assembly. I was referring to the way in which the Assembly will be able to scrutinise legislation and to some of the procedures that will be established for better and more effective scrutiny of legislation. That scrutiny does not happen here, and I hope that it will happen in the Welsh Assembly. The hon. Member for Bridgend has to accept that anomalies will arise. He painted a caricature of what may happen; Unfortunately, that caricature will become a reality as people start to be aware of the anomalies that will exist between Wales and England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might as well mention prescription charges now. The Assembly may decide to reduce those charges and it could do so for all sorts of reasons. After all, it is a devolved body, and it might decide that it does not believe in further increasing prescription charges. It may even wish to reduce them. Again, such decisions could throw up all sorts of fresh problems, as people will decide to cross the bridge and benefit from lower prescription charges, on whichever side of the bridge they apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To think that that will not happen is unrealistic. Will the hon. Member for Bridgend go downstairs and talk to some of the road hauliers who are telling me that people are going daily to Calais and Belgium and filling up their vehicles, because diesel sold there is 30 per cent. cheaper than in Britain? We know that such things happen where the differences are sufficient. The transfer of powers will give the Assembly power to set a prescription charge that is different from that of England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People may think that that would be good news for Wales, but it would not be. If the difference is great enough and people use their prescriptions in Wales instead of England, enormous on-costs could be imposed on the Welsh health budget, which would not be good for the people of Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two or three specific questions that I shall ask quickly. The power of the First Secretary to appoint chairman of bodies is currently possessed by the Secretary of State and will be transferred to the Assembly. Page 97 of the technical guide to the order refers to the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monument Act 1953, and states that the chairman of the Historic Buildings Council for Wales will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
appointed by the Welsh Assembly. The Welsh tourist board is another such organisation, and similar powers will apply under the Tourism Act 1969. Will the First Secretary make such appointments with his Cabinet, or would he again seek wider consultation? Will he make the appointment with similar advice to that currently given to Secretary of State on such decisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 141 of the technical guide refers to the Forestry Act 1967. The description of section 1(5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Power to give directions may be exercised jointly."</p></blockquote>
That issue was raised during the Minister's speech. How will joint decisions be made by the First Secretary and by a Minister in a Westminster Department? Page 255 refers to the Highways Act 1980 and to dealing with trunk roads. We know from Monday's discussions about transport in Abergeron that it will be possible for the Assembly and the First Secretary to introduce charges on motorways and trunk roads. Will the First Secretary be able to utilise those powers separately to directions given by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 157 of the guide refers to section 1(3) of the Abortion Act 1967, and to
	<br><blockquote><p>"The power to approve places for medical termination of pregnancies".</p></blockquote>
Could the Assembly decide completely to outlaw abortion in Wales by closing down places where the power for medical termination of pregnancy exists? Will the First Secretary have that power, or will that be an area in which a Westminster Department could overrule? The First Secretary may have the power to do so by the back door. Westminster may have the power to decide whether abortion should be allowed, but could the Assembly use some of the powers given to it and the First Secretary to decide on a completely different policy from that in effect in England?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands (Methyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do wish that once in a while the hon. Member for Ribble Valley would make some good, sensible points without resorting to such cheap and personal attacks. There were some reasonable points in his speech, but he demeaned them by some of his personal observations. He ought to learn that it would be far better for him to make his case than to make personal attacks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I must tell my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that there is a world of difference between a public consultation document—lots of legislation is the subject of public consultation—and proper legislative scrutiny. The former is not a substitute for the latter. This order, which is, after the Government of Wales Act 1998, the second most important piece of legislation since 1536 for the constitution of Wales, deserves more than an hour and a half's scrutiny. That is a perfectly reasonable point. I shall take the opportunity to raise queries and issues here, which is exactly what I am paid and elected to do. It was perfectly reasonable for the hon. Member for Ribble Valley to raise the scrutiny of such matters.

Having said that, we are used to a long line of bloodcurdling, nightmarish descriptions of devolution. I came across a list of examples dating from the previous attempt at a transfer of functions to Wales—not by politicians, but by knighted mandarins from Whitehall. I read accounts of papers dating from early 1964, debating whether there should be a Secretary of State and a Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Thomas Padmore, the then permanent secretary at the Ministry of Transport, was concerned that if there was a Secretary of State for Wales and a Welsh Office, the roads between England and Wales would not join up. Sir Herbert Andrewes, another mandarin knight, at the Department of Education, thought that all English schools would be denuded of teachers, because in the 1950s we were a big exporter of teachers, and he thought that a Welsh Office and a Secretary of State would repatriate the whole Welsh teaching profession from the diaspora.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Worse, Sir John Winnifrith, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, thought that there would be in-breeding and lack of cross-fertilisation—not of cattle, but of civil servants. Dame Evelyn Sharp thought that she had already discovered in-breeding to be a problem in the Cardiff office in the Ministry of Housing and local Government. So, we are used to observations about the extreme nightmarish consequences of devolution in one form or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, among some of the points made by the hon. Member for Ribble Valley is a reasonable set of issues on which we should satisfy ourselves before we pass the order. While much what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said was useful and allayed a number of my doubts, I would have welcomed a more systematic, structural explanation of the order. It contains two distinct schedules. Schedule 2 is different from schedule 1 for an obvious reason. As I understand it, it concerns issues where there are joint powers—where Ministers and the Assembly must find means of agreement, because they exercise power jointly. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley referred to consultation. However, even schedule 2 prescribes that some functions of the Secretary of State—for example, certain parts of the Copyright Act 1911—
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be exercisable only with the agreement of the Assembly."</p></blockquote>
Other functions, such as the provisions of the Forestry Act 1967, will be exercisable "only after consultation". Schedule 2 thus draws a distinction between functions that must be subject to consultation and functions that must be agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may assist my hon. Friend. I accept his point that different pieces of legislation will operate in different ways, but essentially that applies at the moment—the distinctions are there in existing legislation. In some cases there has to be consultation between one Secretary of State and another, while other measures are a matter of agreement. Thus, the transfer of powers reflects current legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend, but I think that we are entitled to probe further. Two Secretaries of State who are bound by Cabinet
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0191">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
responsibilities and by the concept of collective Government are one thing. In any case, they operate within the Whitehall environment—the Welsh Office has operated entirely in the Whitehall environment, despite the fact that most of it is situated in Cardiff, and the same is true for the Scottish Office in many cases. But there is a world of difference between two parties who belong to the same Cabinet and have joint powers and responsibilities coming to agreements, and a Minister who derives his authority and power from a completely separate base—the elected Assembly—coming to agreements with it. I thought that the whole purpose of devolution was that the Assembly will at various times take a different position from that of the Minister on a host of issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am saying is that provisions such as those in schedule 2 work in Whitehall, because the Secretary of State has to come to an agreement with his colleagues; if not, the matter goes to various Cabinet Committees and is determined within the bounds of that structure. But we are talking about a completely different structure which will have a different political dynamic and a different chemistry. The structures for resolving disputes and disagreements must therefore be much more stringent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an absence of any further thinking—at least, there is in public; no doubt a lot is going on inside the Department, but none has been revealed to us—on how these issues are to be handled. When disagreement occurs on matters that must be agreed under schedule 2, who will resolve those disputes? There will be conflict and disputes. They may involve a series of minor matters—section 15 of the Copyright Act 1911, for example, with which I am not familiar—but we must test the constitutional model against the worst-case scenario. That is the best way to do it. We would at least find out, one hopes, where stresses and strains will occur. I merely suggest that we need to know a little more about the procedure for dealing with disputes arising from schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gerald Howarth 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aldershot)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. In essence, he amplifies the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley made. If he is right that there is no mechanism for resolving such differences, a Welsh Assembly which was controlled by a party that was not in control in this place could use those disagreements to frustrate the workings of Parliament and to try to horse trade for some concession on another matter, as is happening in Europe at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the scenario that the hon. Gentleman describes will occur, but given that there will have to be a procedure of some kind, I want to consider what it might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concordats are one such approach, but the hon. Member for Ribble Valley made no mention of another one, which slipped out in a debate in the House of Lords—it was not mentioned in the Commons. That was the concept of an inter-ministerial council of some kind, although I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
heard nothing further about the evolution of such a council. Will my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State tell us a little more about that before we approve the order?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 of the order deals primarily with the concurrent powers—that is, areas where both the Assembly and Ministers will be responsible for certain aspects of legislation. My favourite example is the transfer of the Docking and Nicking of Horses Act 1949. I am tempted to ask my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State what will happen to horses under devolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask my right hon. Friend about one or two other matters. He mentioned the Water Industry Act 1991. I have been trying to understand the complexities of the concurrent powers as they will apply to the National Lottery Etc. Act 1993. Those are heavily bound up in the two most protected quangos in any democracy, the Sports Council for Wales and the Arts Council of Wales. God forbid that there should be any form of proper democratic control over such bodies. As a result of the decision not to make them directly accountable, we now face an elaborate process of trying to resolve certain aspects of the National Lottery Act in relation to those two bodies. I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will tell us more about the operation of that aspect of the order's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most interesting areas of potential conflict—or, at least, areas that will require co-operation and co-ordination—involve matters such as public health and hygiene. The beef on the bone ban provides an illustration of that. We now know that such issues sound highly technical, but become profoundly political when they go wrong. The bovine spongiform encephalopathy issue was a case in point. There are a whole host of issues involved in dealing with public health and hygiene. Common standards and a division of responsibility are required, and that is where coordination and co-operation will be important. That is, I presume, where the process will be buttressed by concordats. The hon. Member for Ribble Valley was right to ask whether the Welsh Assembly will have the power to lift the ban on beef on the bone. That is an important issue about which there have been big arguments, and it is important to know where power will reside in such cases. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State gave a very straightforward answer on the capacity to vary prescription charges.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another area of potential concern is the environment. In a curiously paradoxical way, powers have been moving in two different directions. They are being devolved down to the Assembly in a whole host of ways, but they are also moving up and out to the European Union through a series of directives and international obligations, which are the responsibility of the UK Government to deliver. The UK Government may want to deliver them, but the means to deliver them will lie with the Assembly. For example, how will the issue of carbon dioxide emissions be handled? My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and the DETR could introduce business parking charges as part of the UK's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0192">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
obligations on climate change. If the Assembly does not follow suit, and somebody sooner or later raises the question whether the obligations are being met, I understand that the UK has an overriding role in compliance with international obligations. How will that be enforced if the individual decisions that have been taken to make the obligations meaningful are not necessarily being followed through? I am not saying that the Assembly would do that—I am sure that it will be as environmentally friendly body as has ever been devised. However, let us test the model, because it is worth testing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware that I do not share his view on this. He speaks as though this were a consequence of the Government of Wales Act 1988, whereas, in fact, the administrative arrangements for setting up the Welsh Office in 1964 have enabled this variation to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1994, the then Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), gave an interpretation of the Rio treaty with regard to England. It involved the need to ban out-of-town shopping centres because they affected the global warming convention signed by the then Prime Minister in 1992. However, the then Secretary of State for Wales, the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr. Redwood), said that out-of-town shopping centres were fine. Those were two separate interpretations of how to comply with the Rio treaty. It was nothing to do with the Government of Wales Act, but a consequence of two Ministers giving two unenforceable interpretations of the same treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend underestimates the difference between the operation of Ministers within the United Kingdom political structure and an Assembly, which has a completely different set of political imperatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Evans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I give one example of where the Welsh Assembly may not wish to introduce certain car parking charges, whether they be tolls or work place charges? One power that remains for the Secretary of State for Wales is to give the Welsh Assembly its budget. It might be inferred by the Secretary of State, and by the Westminster Government, that work place charges and tolls were raising so much money that the revenue was lopped off the total amount, which was then presented to the Welsh Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I call hon. Members' attention to the fact that time is pressing. I should appreciate their co-operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is ridiculous that we are having to race through this debate. These are serious issues, and I hope that we are treating them seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in my right hon. Friend's observation about employment issues. There are now two areas of employment. The powers of the Welsh Development Agency plus the Secretary of State's own powers regarding inward investment and so on are being transferred. But there is an important area of employment surrounding the new deal. The regional
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
employment services are now answering in one way to my right hon. Friend and his Ministers in delivering the new deal. But the budget for the new deal does not belong to the block grant—that comes out of the hypothecated account from the windfall tax. The rules and regulations governing who qualifies under the new deal is determined outside. I understand from my right hon. Friend that a concordat exists already. I should like to know more about how the Assembly will deal with employment issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution could mean possible areas of conflict—differences of views and attitude—in areas such as the environment, public health and employment. We will therefore need methods for resolving disputes. Before we go very much further, we should have a much clearer idea from my right hon. Friend and his colleagues of how such matters will be resolved. The character and nature of the concordats need further explanation. How, when agreement is required, will disputes be resolved, and if they are not resolved, what happens then? Those are the sort of issues that we should be testing before we agree to the transfer of functions. It is a new constitution for Wales, and we all want it to work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Livsey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brecon and Radnorshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard this as a historic document. As the hon. Member for Bridgend said, the technical guide is 535 pages, and the guide itself is 222 pages. It is a massive piece of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be wrong, but I believe that functions can be altered by the Assembly through secondary legislation. As far as I know—the Secretary of State may like to put me right, because I am no lawyer—one method of achieving transfer will be statutory instruments. The concordats will obviously affect the matter as well. I am not absolutely clear about what the status of any Orders in Council from this place will be. I have been unable to read all the detail in the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make several points on specific issues. First, there are issues that one would like to appear in the document but which do not, such as powers over the Welsh Rugby Union—but there we go. On a more serious point, section 90(1) of the Agriculture Act 1947—Welsh rugby was in a far better state then than it is now—states that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Secretary of State may manage, farm, sell, let…land acquired by him".</p></blockquote>
I hope that it will be possible, through the Welsh Assembly, to get a few young farmers back on the land. The average age of farmers at present is 58. Soon, there will be no farmers because they will all be under the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forestry Commission and the MoD own a tremendous amount of land in Wales. Will the Secretary of State be able to acquire some of it—perhaps for well-constructed purposes? Some of it is being used already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter of principle is that section 90(1) uses the words "acquired by him". Such an assumption about gender is typical of some legislation. None the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
less, we may well have a woman Secretary of State at some point. I have no doubt that we will—I respect the power of Welsh women, which we know well from our own experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing worries me. The document refers to the Official Secrets Act 1989 and states that the Assembly and the Secretary of State can prescribe people—presumably in Wales—for perhaps not toeing the line as regards that Act. That was a big issue in one of the debates that we had on the Government of Wales Bill. I trust that those powers will be used responsibly and, if possible, not at all. They are draconian powers for the Secretary of State or the Assembly to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other questions relate to finance. The only reference to finance that I can see—I am sure that there are others—is to the Finance Act 1908. It gives local government the power to deal in game and to issue licences for killing game. I am not surprised that there are no other really weighty issues, given that the Assembly has no powers to raise finance. There is, of course, the issue of the block grants and the Barnett formula. In the context of the transfer of functions, how will the Assembly be able to make representations—I assume that that is all that it will be able to do—on altering the formula? It would clearly have to be altered through primary legislation in the House. Will there be a concordat—the Secretary of State at the time referred to one—in relation to the formula? It will be interesting to know because the size of the block grant is absolutely crucial. The Assembly, local government and other functions in Wales will be entirely dependent on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are a few of the concerns that I and my party have. I am sure that the Secretary of State will deal with them in the limited time that we have left.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for their comments and questions. Several serious points have been raised and I will try to cover them; if I do not do so adequately, I will write to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ribble Valley asked about appointments. The Assembly will make appointments and will decide the procedures that should be followed in making them, and set them out in its Standing Orders. It will therefore decide whether to delegate powers and how to make such appointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) raised the issue of the national lottery and referred to concurrent powers. The Assembly will be able to issue directions to the National Lottery Charities Board and to the national heritage memorial fund so far as they relate to Wales, but not so as to alter Wales' share of UK resources. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will be able to exercise those functions concurrently as part of his UK responsibility for lottery matters. He will have to consult the Assembly before doing so, which is provided for by schedule 2 of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport recently introduced a completely different order of priorities by creating the opportunities fund. If he were to take similar action after the establishment of the Assembly, he would presumably have to consult it. If, after consultation, the Assembly did not wish to support the new order of priorities, whose will would prevail?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I am right in saying that that example involves the apportionment of funds. Responsibility for that falls to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and would therefore remain with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right to mention consultation. An awful lot of consultation goes on within Government in addition to that which is required. There are general opportunities to consult, to comment and to be aware of decisions that are being taken around Government and therefore to influence decision making. I envisage that the Assembly will have the opportunity to be alert to and aware of decisions that are being made and to make representations about them. As I said, the responsibility and powers are clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth reminding the Committee that the staff of the National Assembly remain members of the home civil service. That is important, because such people must be able to talk and relate to the staff of other Departments and to consult them and communicate with them. Similarly, the Assembly Secretaries and First Secretary will be able to build up effective ways to work by using developing and changing relationships with Departments of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney rightly referred to the suspicion that predated the arrival of the Welsh Office on the scene. Over time, it has become accepted that the Welsh Office machinery is as much a part of Government as other Government Departments. It may take a little time for the relationship between Departments of Government at Whitehall and the Assembly to settle down into a good understanding, because the Assembly is an animal that has not existed until now: it is a new animal and people will have to get used to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell my hon. Friend that I have taken the trouble to hold discussions about precisely those issues with colleagues at the Cabinet Office and with the permanent secretary to the Cabinet. Many such matters are dealt with by making common-sense arrangements to ensure that the Assembly works. The order is specifically about powers and it cannot transfer relationships, if I may put it that way. We have to work on relationships, some of which can be formalised into concordats, as it is sensible to plan ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to officials at the Welsh Office for their work and for that done in liaison with other Departments. I have been impressed by the care with which they have tried to think forward, work forward and anticipate some of the aspects of the new system about which hon. Members have spoken. Some matters can be dealt with by transfer of powers and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
requirement to consult or to take action only with the agreement of the Assembly. Other matters will require the careful thought that I mentioned. It will, for instance, be demanding for the First Secretary and the Assembly Secretaries to work through their relationship with Government Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To give one example, I sat down recently with the other Agriculture Ministers to discuss the way in which Welsh interests could be adequately represented in Brussels following devolution. We also talked about the current situation. The result is that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) spent a couple of days in Brussels this week ensuring that there was a strong Welsh voice in the on-going representations and discussions relating to important decisions on agricultural matters. We have discussed how that will change when the Assembly is established. It is not the sort of thing to be included in a transfer of powers order because it is the stuff of relationships and co-operative working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious of the time, but will try to deal with the points that arose in the debate, although not necessarily in the right order. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire asked whether the Assembly could alter the transfer order. Transfer orders can be made only if both Houses approve them, as prescribed by section 22 of the Government of Wales Act 1998. The Assembly has no role in transferring powers, although obviously any transfer of powers is likely to be the subject of representations or discussions in advance of decisions being made by this House. The power to transfer powers, however, remains with Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the Agriculture Act 1947. I believe that the provision to which he referred was intended for immediate postwar purposes, although there may well be no reason why the Assembly could not adopt the course that he described. He also referred to the Official Secrets Act 1989. The only powers being transferred are those prescribing non-civil servants who are to be subject to the Act and only then in relation to the Assembly's functions. Am example might be contractors working for the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire will agree that the transfer is logical, reasonable and limited to what is required. My tongue is only slightly in my cheek when I say that the hon. Gentleman's concern about the limitation on the Assembly's powers over Welsh rugby is misplaced. Clause 32(d) of the Government of Wales Act 1998 gives the Assembly the power to
	<br><blockquote><p>"do anything it considers appropriate to support…sport…or recreational activities in Wales."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire referred to the Barnett formula. Certainly, the Assembly will take a close interest in financial arrangements and the relationship with central Government. Issues relating to the efficacy of the formula and needs assessment will be a matter for discussion between the Assembly and the Treasury
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
and I am sure that Members of the Assembly will want to discuss them to understand how the situation came about, and to debate possible future arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention was made of the ministerial council. I can confirm that it will be established. That issue would not appear in the transfer of powers order, but I would be happy to return to the point either in future discussions in the House or in correspondence with my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. I assure him that there has been no slacking of our intention to ensure that the fallback arrangements of the ministerial council are in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked about the enforcement of international obligations. Section 108 of the Government of Wales Act 1998 gives Ministers an override power where necessary to ensure compliance with international obligations. Subsections (7) and (8) of section 108 make it possible for a Minister to specify the proportion of quantitative requirement—for example, on emissions—where that needs to be allocated to Wales. Thus, the issue is allowed for in the primary legislation. The necessary arrangements for other international obligations are made in other primary legislation. For example, the European convention on human rights was incorporated into UK law by an Act that was passed recently, so its requirements would of course have to be observed by the Assembly, as by other bodies within Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Day</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I hear the Secretary of State correctly? Did he say that the Secretary of State for Wales would have overriding powers to ensure that international treaty obligations—on environmental matters, and so on—were met? If those powers had to be used, what on earth would happen to all the co-operation that the Minister hopes for—indeed, which we all hope for—between the new Assembly and the Secretary of State?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was answering the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, whch was whether there were default mechanisms to ensure that international obligations were kept. There are such mechanisms. I regard it as highly unlikely that they will need to be used. Indeed, their very existence is the best possible provision to ensure that the usual arrangements are pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always possible for those with a fevered imagination to envisage circumstances in which an absurd course of action is taken. I must tell the hon. Member for Cheadle that neither the order nor the primary legislation make it compulsory to do the absurd. It would be unwise to ignore the system of concordats and to expect problems to arise. Neither is it sensible to imagine that if there are differences between the two sides of the bridge, the absurd will always be on the Welsh side. It may well be that the Assembly, as an accountable body, will take decisions with which, on reflection, UK or England-only Departments will quickly want to come into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly will also be able to take constructive and creative decisions. For example, the proposition that free travel—concessionary travel, in the first instance—for pensioners should be available throughout Wales has won considerable support. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
are on the way to having a transport system that respects the needs of elderly people in Wales. It is suggested that that schemes be extended to visitors to Wales, to encourage older people to come, thus stimulating the tourist trade, increasing the use of buses, and making Wales more attractive to those outside. If that is the differnce between the two sides of the border, I would have thought that we should support and welcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I accept what the Secretary of State has just said. Indeed, only this weekend, the Home Secretary's injunction on reporting of the Stephen Lawrence report in England could not be carried in Scotland, because Scotland has different law. That situation changed the next day, when newspapers were able to report on that document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning harmonisation of taxes, the Secretary of State must concede that when there are lower taxes than in England, in Calais for example, people will
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
travel there. If people acted similarly in respect of prescription charges, that could have a massive impact on the Welsh health budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was raised in relation to the Highways Act 1980. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions will have no function in respect of Welsh trunk roads. In respect of the Abortion Act 1967, the hon. Member for Ribble Valley asked whether the Welsh Assembly could outlaw abortion. Absolutely not. It could not refuse to license any places where abortions could be carried out; it must act in accordance with the legislation passed by this House.
