	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Stern 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 9, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or any other relevant place"</p></blockquote>
and insert "relevant place or nearby".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 11, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"or any other".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is not so much to attach the principles of the Bill, but to amend its wording, which grants to the police more extensive powers than are necessary to achieve its aims. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Dr. Spink), the promoter of the Bill, can reassure me that the powers in the Bill are no more than are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(1)(b) deals with the confiscation of intoxicating liquor, when it is purchased by an adult to be consumed by a person under the age of 18. I am concerned about the width of the suspicion that could be open to the police. Under the wording of clause 1(1)(b), it would be possible for a constable to arrest an adult who was purchasing alcohol at a supermarket in Westminster if the constable had reasonable suspicion that it would be passed on to a young person in Southampton. My amendment would restrict severely the range of suspicion that could be allotted to the police under paragraph (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, I believe that the Bill is intended to cover circumstances where there is a suspicion that alcohol is being purchased to be handed to someone immediately outside the store. That is why I want to introduce into the clause the word "nearby", rather than leave the Bill open to a complete lack of geographical limitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled amendment No. 2 because the Bill grants the police powers that are wider than necessary. For example, if the Bill allows a constable to take action because he suspects that someone in a public place has recently consumed intoxicating liquor, are we not giving the police the power to arrest a young person simply because he is drunk? He may be drunk when he is seen by the policeman, but he may have consumed the alcohol elsewhere. I doubt whether the purpose of the Bill is to add to the public order powers; it is concerned with the confiscation of alcohol. Clause 1(1)(c) would add a power to arrest a person for drunkenness to the otherwise admirable provisions of the Bill. I do not think that such a power is necessary. The police already have powers to arrest for public order offences, but the power to arrest merely on
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
suspicion that a young person is drunk is going a little too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Robert Spink 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a source of great pleasure and comfort that you, Sir James, are taking the Chair for this important Committee. The Bill will have an effect in every village, town and city in the country. It will help young and old alike; it will make our communities more pleasant, and our streets safer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the opening remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern). I know that he is keen that the Bill should quickly become law. I know that he recognises its benefits, not least in preventing the onset of public disorder by preventing young people from coming under the influence of drink, making a nuisance of themselves and getting criminal records that will follow them round for the rest of their lives. I know that my hon. Friend does not want to obfuscate the Bill's powers, and I am grateful to him for bringing forward for debate such matters as this, which will help us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members will agree that the Bill provides a simple, down-to-earth solution to what is unfortunately an increasingly common problem. If the power to require the surrender of alcohol is to work, it is essential that the police should not become engaged in unnecessary, fruitless arguments, particularly arguments on the streets with young people, who are quite devious and will do whatever they can to avoid being controlled by the police. Simplicity, clarity and certainty are essential in all law—not just in the Bill—if it is to be easily understood and therefore effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment, because it makes the Bill less clear and therefore less effective. The Bill allows a police officer to confiscate alcohol from a person of 18 or over if he reasonably believes that that adult has given, or is likely to give, the alcohol to a young person to be consumed in a relevant place—that can be the same place or any other relevant place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) defines "relevant place" as being
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) any public place, other than licensed premises; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(b) any place, other than a public place, to which the person has unlawfully gained access".</p></blockquote>
The Bill thus enables constables to require the surrender of alcohol in all places to which the public have a right of access. That would include such places as shopping malls and streets, public parks, cinemas and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Lady Olga Maitland) said on Second Reading, trains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person had unlawfully gained access to a property—these problems occur in private gardens, derelict buildings and even school grounds—it would not be possible, under the Bill, for the adult to avoid the requirement to surrender the alcoholic drink by taking the cans of lager or the alcopops, doing a swift bit of legwork down the street or into a nearby garden and claiming that he was not in the company of the underage person. If the constable reasonably believed that that person had supplied a young person with alcohol, he could require the surrender of any remaining alcohol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendment No. 1 were accepted, an officer could require the surrender of alcohol from a person of 18 years or over only if he were in the same place as the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
young person or in a nearby relevant place. If amendment No. 2 were accepted, the surrender of alcohol could be required of a person of 18 years or over only if its consumption by an under-age drinker had occurred in the same relevant place. It would not be possible if it had occurred in any other relevant place. The amendments would therefore create a problem for officers seeking to enforce the law. They would need to judge how far apart people should be in order to be considered as being in different places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example given by my hon. Friend—of someone purchasing alcohol in Westminster and taking it to Southampton to give to a young person there—is not practical. A police constable in Westminster could not reasonably ascertain what that person would do when he got off the train or out of his car in Southampton, so I reject that analysis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Littleborough and Saddleworth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has just suggested that the amendments might make enforcement more difficult. I am most concerned about the enforcement of the Bill. The Bill provides for the surrender of alcohol and its containers, but how will a policeman take charge of the situation? How will alcohol and its containers be surrendered to him?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, there may be 10 youths gathered in a park, surrounded by alcohol. They may have already consumed a good deal of the alcohol and may be inebriated. A police officer who approaches them will have the power under the Bill to confiscate the alcohol. How will he physically take possession of it? As I understand it—perhaps the hon. Gentleman can clarify this—there are no powers in the Bill to enable the police officer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is this an intervention or a speech?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman take me through how the police officer will confiscate the alcohol without undermining his own position by making himself look ridiculous?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that point, because it gives us the opportunity to consider the essence of the operation of the Bill. It is right that we consider that now, so that it is absolutely clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police officer will go to the young people whom he sees or suspects of consuming alcohol and ask them to surrender that alcohol to him. Usually, they will do so, and that will be the end of the matter. The police officer may well report the young people to their parents, and their parents will do what they have to do, but that will be the end of the matter in the eyes of the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The policeman will take the alcohol away. I hope that he will pour it down the nearest drain, rather than take it back to the station for a party. I am sure that chief constables will lay down proper instructions for their constables. The police officer will physically take away the alcohol from the young person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a young person attempts to conceal the alcohol or refuses to give it up, the police officer will arrest that
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
young person and take him to the station, where he will be dealt with. The police officer will have no power to search the young person on the street, in the park or behind the bicycle shed. We thought it better not to give police officers that power, because we want to avoid confrontation between the police and groups of youngsters on the street. We know that youngsters on the street often respond to a policeman with bravado in front of their friends. They show off and act big, but when they are taken to the privacy of the police station and faced with the custody sergeant telephoning their mum and dad, they usually get very sensible very quickly and co-operate, which means that the matter can be dealt with summarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police must be given the power to deal with the matter, because to walk away and allow a young person to keep and drink alcohol and they to get up to mischief would be to betray that young person and put him in grave danger. I believe that 93 per cent.—or some similar percentage—of first use of drugs occurs under the influence of alcohol. Alcohol leads young people into petty crime and serious crime; they take cars, joyride and kill themselves and their friends. Tragedies occur in our communities because of alcohol and its influence on delicate young minds. It is right that we give the police full powers to deal with the matter in a preventive manner. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Littleborough and Saddleworth (Mr. Davies) for allowing me to make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my earlier point about distance, which was raised by the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West. If the supplier of the alcohol and the young person were separated by, say, 50 m, would they be in the same relevant place or in nearby relevant places? What if they were half a mile apart? We might agree that they were not in the same relevant place, but would they be in nearby relevant places? Those are difficult questions, which would cause problems of drafting and legal interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is a simple, straightforward and commonsense measure that can be easily applied by the police officer on the street. That officer will generally be the community beat officer who will know from walking around the young lads and girls on the street. Our police officer will not have to pace out distances on the street, checking mileages or determining what is a nearby place; he will simply take away the alcohol. That is the purpose of the Bill and what we want to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would people be in different relevant places if one person were in a public street and one was in a private garden to which he had unlawfully gained access? They would be in different kinds of relevant place, but they might be separated by only a few feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that the amendment would be most unhelpful. It would lead to lengthy arguments; it would wreck the Bill's purpose and, I suspect, make it unworkable. We must avoid allowing youngsters to retain the liquor by the simple act of passing a can across a garden wall or hotfooting it down the street. I know that my hon. Friend is keen to see the Bill on the statute book so that his constituents can benefit from it. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
hope, therefore, that he will agree to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point for his explanations. I fear, however, that he has not entirely met the purposes of my amendments. We are dealing with two entirely different matters, and I shall deal first with relevant place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was right; the amendments are probing and they are technically deficient for the reasons that he pointed out. However, it is not satisfactory to say that because the amendment is technically deficient we must accept the arguments for what I suspect is the equally deficient wording in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is huge difficulty in defining what is a relevant place and what is nearby. Probing amendment No. 2 is designed to elicit whether we are giving the police the power to arrest and charge young people because they may have been drinking at some other time in some other place. I am not prepared to allow the Bill to provide that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more serious question relates to clause 1(1)(b) and the confiscation of intoxicating liquor that has been purchased by an adult. Here, we are no longer talking about the involvement of any young person, except when the police constable "reasonably suspects" that an adult is buying alcohol for young persons. My hon. Friend did not like the example of alcohol purchased in Westminster for consumption in Southampton, but an example that he may find more reasonable is alcohol purchased by an adult in a supermarket in Westminster when there is a rave in Hyde Park nearby. A constable may have the reasonable suspicion that the adult is purchasing the alcohol for a young person to consume at that rave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are difficulties of legal definition. Indeed, I may need to call on my hon. Friend the Minister to assist me in the matter, as the Bill nowhere describes what makes it reasonable for a police constable to believe that alcohol is being purchased by one person for consumption by another. We may be setting up a feast for lawyers, who will seek to determine whether the constable had reasonable belief at the time and place considered in the court some months afterwards. I am reluctant to import such a process into the law. Given that we are talking about giving constables the power to confiscate private property from adults on suspicion, we are entitled to seek a slightly tighter definition in the Bill of the circumstances in which adults can be forced to give up their property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mr. Timothy Kirkhope)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for missing the beginning of the debate; I might not have heard all the points raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fully understand the wish of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West to make the Bill as effective as possible. I am sure that the Committee would also want that. However, we should allow the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Bill to remain a no-nonsense measure, giving the police the flexibility that is so necessary in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to over-define, we would run into considerable problems in making the Bill work in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point envisages. After all, we are not looking to arrest young people, but for something that is available in many local authorities under byelaws—a power merely to remove the problem without much paperwork, or involving young people in criminality. Therefore, there must be a certain onus on the police to act reasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West has just asked whether we should tighten the definitions in the Bill. I might be contradicted, but I think that there are many other instances in which the police are obliged to act reasonably and to justify their actions later, if necessary. Taking alcohol away from young people would be a useful tool for the police, who are presently frustrated by their inability to do so and their ability to involve young people in the criminal system on the basis of alcohol purchase only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point has gone about the Bill in a very sensible way. If we were to tighten the definition, for example, on "relevant place"—a matter to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West alluded—and not allow flexibility, we would create the ridiculous situation where the police would arrive on the spot to deal with an adult with a young person, but the adult could hop over a wall and, therefore, into another relevant place. That would effectively ensure that the powers in the Bill could not be exercised. However, I fully understand the motives of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister and I am sure that later in his speech he will deal with the confiscation of alcohol from adults under clause 1(1)(b). I entirely accept his point about the confiscation of alcohol from young people—the main purpose of the Bill—but will Parliament have sight of the typical instructions on the enforcement of the Bill that chief constables will give to members of their forces? At the weekend, beat policemen in my constituency told me that they do not want more power under the Bill than simply being able to confiscate alcohol from young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is guidance, as my hon. Friend knows, on all aspects of criminal law as it is put into practice by police forces. If he is saying that there should be further guidance or a code of practice which Parliament could scrutinise, that is difficult—particularly in regard to simple legislation such as the Bill. There are many safeguards, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, in regard to the police's conduct in carrying out their duties. I mentioned reasonableness; there are many examples of circumstances in which police have to act in a reasonable manner. They are subject not only to discipline and to the scrutiny of the law, but, in cases where the police have clearly stepped outside their powers, to the police complaints procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure my hon. Friend agrees, there are difficulties with the legislation. We are trying hard to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0023">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
keep young people out of the criminal system, but if they fail to surrender a bottle or can or to give their name and address when requested to do so by a police constable, they enter that system. It is reasonable that a police constable should have that information and should be able to ask an individual to surrender alcohol.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said earlier that where there are byelaws that prohibit drinking on the streets, the police are empowered to remove the problem. Do they not do so by telling individuals that they must go inside and that if they do not they may be arrested, rather than by having confiscatory powers? So that the police can meet the wish of the hon. Member for Castle Point and remove the problem, should they not have the powers to deal with situations as they find them? Confiscation might be appropriate in some cases, but in others the police may need to arrest one or several individuals. Having no more than a confiscatory power might make the police look ridiculous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Byelaws around the country differ; importantly, we are trying to make the position national and consistent, which removes some of the misunderstanding about the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West said about seizure is true; byelaws do not usually contain a power of seizure. We believe that that is another reason why my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point introduced the Bill; it would be useful for the police to have the power of confiscation. The police have other powers, not only in byelaws, to enable them to respond to groups of young people who are causing a nuisance, but the police are limited in respect of confiscation. The power of confiscation is undoubtedly important in the experience of Scotland. I am sure that many hon. Members receive complaints about young people's access to alcohol and there is certainly a nuisance, as my hon. Friend said. To remove their access to it by confiscation without getting young people immediately into the criminal system, unless they disobey the reasonable requests of a police officer, seems an ideal way of dealing with the problem—although I admit that it does not tie up every point that the hon. Member for Littleborough and Saddleworth raised. Perhaps there is not a totally ideal solution; one has to rely on the common sense and reasonableness of our police force.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his comments and I am sure that he was about to come on to the point that I shall make. We require a different level of proof and of expectations of enforcement in confiscating alcohol from adults under paragraph 1(1)(b) than in confiscating alcohol from young people under paragraphs (a) and (c). I hope that my hon. Friend will deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 1 deals with a difficult area in regard to the requirement for different types of proof. One would expect someone over 18 to have greater responsibility, not only in regard to himself but in regard to his actions that have led to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
encouragement of young people to consume alcohol. It may be that my hon. Friend is suggesting that there should be a tighter, tougher approach to them rather than merely surrendering the alcohol. I know that my hon. Friend has been talking about the definition in terms of "relevant place", but there must be as much flexibility as possible because of what I said earlier about the location of the people involved and whether someone is over or under 18 years of age. With regard to surrender, it is equally applicable for a police officer to confiscate from someone who is over 18 as much as it is if he is under 18 if it is part of the same situation as perceived by the police officer when there are both adults and young people involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, North-West made some important points when speaking to his amendments, but I am not sure that I can answer him to his total satisfaction. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point has got the balance just about right in his Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is a danger that clause 1 will create a paradise for criminal lawyers—on legal aid—at juvenile courts. However, I was about to ask to withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should point out that when the amendment is withdrawn there can be no further debate on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 3, in page 1, line 14, leave out from "liquor" to end of line 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister touched on the problem that I foresee in the relevant lines in clause 1(1). I want the Committee to try to envisage the circumstances on the street. Let us imagine that a constable approaches a young person—of either sex—carrying a bottle or can that appears to contain alcohol. The constable has a reasonable belief that it is alcohol and that the young person is drinking it, so he tells the young person that he wants the bottle or can or asks him to pour it down the nearest drain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most cases, as was mentioned earlier, the policeman will already know the name and address of the young person involved because local policemen tend to know the local tearaways. However, that will not always be the case. It is common in my constituency, which comprises a number of suburbs in north Bristol, for groups of youths—often with one or two females attached—to move from one suburb to drink in another. They may not be known to the beat policeman in the other suburb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Therefore, there is a person on the street carrying a bottle or can that might contain liquor. Under the Bill, the policeman will rightly have the power to say, "I intend to confiscate that liquor." If the young person refuses to allow it to be confiscated, the constable will be entitled to make an arrest. However, the Bill imports another principle. The young person may agree to the liquor being confiscated, but even before it is proved that it is liquor, the Bill gives a further power to the constable to demand the name and address of the young person. I wonder why it has been thought necessary to import that provision into the Bill. The constable, as part of his normal police duties, may want to call round to the parents of the young person involved and say, "Did you know that little Johnnie or little Mary was found drinking in the street the other day? You know it is an offence, so do you want to have a word with him or her?" That would be perfectly normal community policing. However, a specific power for the police to demand a name and address—and presumably proof of that name and address—is unnecessary, unless it was always the intention of the police that the apparent offence of consuming intoxicating liquor on the street should lead to prosecution. I do not believe that that is the Bill's intention. It is certainly not the desire of the police, as expressed to me. So, my first query is why is that power necessary?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second purpose to the amendment. On Second Reading, I said that there would be a huge temptation for the young person to give a false name and address, because the circumstances would be such that the young person was not already known to the police. I have asked around my constituency and, to my regret, schemes such as the Portman Group scheme, which encourages young people to carry identity cards, are little known and little used. Perhaps we would be proposing different legislation if the Portman Group scheme were more widely used. Therefore, we are importing into the Bill a requirement to carry proof of name and address, which goes wider than the Bill was designed to achieve. I want to tease out from my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point why the provision is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that issue, which is the essence of the Bill. There are few occasions for us in the House to reinforce parental responsibility, to put the control of youngsters back with the parents, where it belongs, and to take it away from the police and the courts. I see the Bill as a measure to help the youngsters themselves, rather than the wider community, although it will do that too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot forget the link to drugs, which is one of the great dangers of our time, and the protection that we need to give young people. Parental responsibility should be reinforced at all possible times. As a parent, I would be appalled if I thought that someone knew that my children were getting up to mischief or putting themselves in danger, but had not formally told me on each occasion, so that I could exercise my duty and responsibility to control and guide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that all members of the Committee agree that parents have a vital role to play in ensuring that children
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
grow up in a responsible way and with a responsible attitude to drinking, in particular. I know that the vast majority of parents would be appalled to discover that their children were involved in drinking binges in public places, but I know that many of the children of my constituents are because I go out on the streets in my constituency. Recently, I have been taking round radio and television crews every weekend. I know exactly where to find the children. Those youngsters tell me that they agree with the Bill. They will not like having their drink taken away, but they know why the Bill has been introduced and agree with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day, I asked a 12-year-old who was drinking a can of lager, "What would your dad say if he knew?" He replied, "He'd kill me." The boy was exaggerating; I do not think that the father would have killed him, but he would have taken action to control him. Under the Bill, that father would know, as he should, what his 12-year-old son was doing, so that he could stop him from becoming a 14-year-old drug user, a 16-year-old delinquent and a 20-year-old criminal with no life in front of him—with a destroyed life. Alcohol plus young people in public places is a recipe for disaster, and we must do everything to prevent it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "Do you know where your children are?" campaign that was run in Weymouth last year gave us the information that we needed about parental control. It dealt with 139 children, whose parents were informed about what they were doing. Only eight of the 139 have come to the notice of the police a second time. That suggests that parents are, by the large, responsible. They want to and will do the right thing and control their children—all they need is the information, which gives them the power to take the right action. We can give them that power; it is our duty to give them that information so that they can carry out their responsibilities more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill properly avoids criminalising young people. Its aim is to keep young people out of the criminal justice system, thereby saving police and court time as well as saving the young people the problem of having to live with a record. It is about teaching young people to behave responsibly. That must start and end in the family—in the home with the parents—and we are failing if it takes place in the courts with the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One strand of the Bill is to enable the police to confiscate alcohol when they see youngsters drinking it in public places. The power is discretionary; the police need not use it if they think it inappropriate. However, I hope that they will use it as a rule, as it is one of the best bits of the Bill and one of the most essential measures that we can provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be occasions when it would wholly irresponsible for the police not to inform the parents. On Second Reading, I gave the example of a group of 80 youngsters, including nine-year-olds, getting tanked up on alcohol in a school playing field. I would have been absolutely furious if I had been the parent of one of those nine-year-olds and not been told by the police who had caught them so that I could control little Johnnie, help him along the right way and correct his actions. I would have thought that the police were taking too much on themselves and taking away my ability to control my own children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I believe that, by and large, parents will take action if they are given the information. We should give them that information. I hope that the Committee agrees that the measure is in the interests of the young people and that the police should have the discretionary power. I ask my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeff Ennis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barnsley, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a certain amount of sympathy with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West. I hope that the general thrust of the Bill will command all-party support, as it is a commonsense measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may, I shall preface my remarks about the amendment with a few general comments. In my part of the world, Barnsley, East, which consists primarily of former mining villages with populations of between 2,000 and 5,000 or 6,000, under-age drinking is one of the main sources of social unrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example that encapsulates the problem that we face, and that we must address, is the village where I live, Brierley, near Barnsley. It is a former mining village with a population of about 2,000. We have two shops in Brierley, a post office, one pub and one club. Unfortunately, youngsters congregate in large numbers outside one of the shops—an off licence—and on some nights there are crowds of between 50 and 80 young people gathered outside drinking alcohol, many of whom are under-age drinkers who do not live in the village but come to meet their school friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That creates three main problems. There is environmental nuisance caused by the discarding of empty cans, the smashing of bottles, and so on. Acts of petty vandalism and hooliganism follow—a nice sandstone wall adjacent to the shop has recently been broken down. The other main problem is threats—as the young people drink more and more, they verbally, if not physically, abuse others. Older people who need provisions from the shop dare not go after dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A couple of weeks ago, the shop closed because the shop owner went bankrupt. Normally, when a corner shop in a former mining village closes, there is a petition and an outcry from the local populace to get it reopened as quickly at possible. That was not so in this case. Because of the problems caused by under-age drinkers, many people who live around the shop do not want it to reopen. So that is a big problem. As the hon. Member for Castle Point has pointed out, the consumption of alcohol on the streets by under-age drinkers eventually leads to the consumption of drugs, which is another great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I have a certain amount of sympathy with the amendment. I fully support the police having powers under the Bill, but we must focus on the practicalities of confiscation. We must try to adopt a mechanism that defuses rather than exacerbates the problem. If we give the police powers to ask for names and so on, bravado becomes a factor, and we introduce the threat of escalation and public affray, instead of the police having the power to defuse the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Byelaws should be the model for the Bill. If it is an absolute offence to drink on the streets, when youngsters see a policeman approaching and they have drink in their possession, they know that may be
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
charged. Youngsters should be able to take action before the police do. I hope that the confiscation of alcohol will be the last resort, because in practice that may escalate rather than defuse a situation. On that basis, I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you may have gathered, Sir James, I have some criticisms of the Bill's drafting, and I share the concern of the hon. Member for Barnsley, East (Mr. Ennis) about the practicalities of implementing the Bill. However, in this instance I come to the defence of the hon. Member for Castle Point and do not support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Mr. Stern) suggested that it would be necessary for young people to carry proof of their name and address to establish in the police constable's mind that names and addresses. I do not believe that that is the case; what is needed is honesty rather than proof. The suggestion that young people would be more likely than not to give a false name and address is not warranted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I am an innocent here, and I should be delighted if the Minister would come to my rescue. I had always assumed not only that it was reasonable for young people asked by the police to give their name and address to give it, but that the law would require it of them. However, if the Bill introduces a new provision I should be grateful for some enlightenment, because that would considerably increase the Bill's importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly try to deal with that point. First, however, I shall remind the Committee of the reasons for the Bill. It arose as a result of the focused concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point. However, in the background were the many initiatives taken—often as partnerships between local police forces, local communities and other groups—to try to deal with nuisances in the community and to bring about a greater level of responsibility in the behaviour of parents towards their children, as well as self-discipline in the children and young people themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point mentioned the Weymouth experience, which worked extremely well. Information about young people's behaviour was responsibly handled by the police, who liaised with parents over what might be done to prevent their children heading towards lawlessness and to turn them, instead, into responsible members of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the police in Weymouth had no difficulty in obtaining accurate names and addresses—it was not a major problem—and received a positive feedback from parents, who were delighted to be given positive help rather than have to turn up at court to defend their little ones?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely; my hon. Friend is quite right. In many ways, what he says underpins what we are trying to do, which is to create a comparatively no-nonsense approach to an undoubted problem and, if possible, to prevent young people from being put through the criminal system by taking early action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0026">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
There is no general requirement for names and addresses to be given—it is only if the police suspect that an offence is being committed. The Bill's provisions are not quite in that category; the police may take away alcohol when they see it. We believe it necessary—I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point agrees—to put that requirement in the Bill to ensure that there is no misunderstanding. We have also had the opportunity to debate parental responsibility and the fact that in Weymouth—one of many examples—the police found it helpful to advise parents that their children's behaviour had gone slightly wrong or that their children were going off the rails a bit, which may have helped to put things right at an early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The police do not want those names and addresses for surreptitious reasons. They are entitled under the Bill to ask for that information and they may wish to use that to tell parents of their children's circumstances. Under some partnership arrangements, such as those in Weymouth, young people may receive education and assistance to help improve their position. That is the reason for the requirement to give names and addresses. The Government have noted the reasons given for the amendment, but we believe that the power is useful and very much in tune with the general tenor of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that when the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West responds he will take the Minister's remarks into account. The two chief superintendents who govern the territory of my constituency encourage constables to take the names and addresses of young people who, for example, cause problems in local parks, and to write to their parents. That has advantages, such as that described by the hon. Member for Castle Point. However, I should be concerned if streetwise kids began to realise that there was no clear justification for their names and addresses being taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concerns that the public express are often associated with alcohol. The provision requiring names and addresses to be given strengthens the Bill and deals with the fundamental issue—reducing the nuisance caused to constituents across the country. Removing that provision would therefore weaken the Bill in a way that I would not like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a most useful debate; several different strands have been brought out from a small paragraph in the Bill. I thank the hon. Member for Littleborough and Saddleworth; there is no basic disagreement between us. We all want the police to be able to use the powers under the Bill to involve parents —where there are parents to be involved—and to ensure that the Bill becomes a tool in community policing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I disagree with the hon. Member for Littleborough and Saddleworth about the circumstances in which names and addresses will be requested. Young people will give false names and addresses out of bravado and with the encouragement of their friends. In doing so, they will make the job of community policemen that bit harder because they might suspect that they have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
given a false information—I gave an example of that on Second Reading—but might not be able to prove it, short of making an arrest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Barnsley, East (Mr. Ennis) for his helpful comments on the amendment. During his short membership of the House, he has created the impression of someone who builds his remarks on the back on constituency experience, which is useful to our debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for his comments. However, I shall add a word of warning. As with all legislation, the Bill is a compromise. My hon. Friend the Minister has accepted that it is unlikely, but possible, that in achieving the laudable aim of the clause—that is, to involve the family—we might accidently extend both the power of arrest and the offence of failing to give a name and address. I am sure that he will agree that, if and when—we all hope that it does not happen—a bright criminal lawyer in a juvenile court decides to make an issue of the fact that his young, innocent client, who had not been drinking in the first place, was arrested for failing to give his name and address, it will not be especially comfortable to have to prosecute such a case. I accept that that is likely to be fairly rare—perhaps it will never happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have persuaded the hon. Member for Barnsley, East to agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point—that is, that such powers are discretionary. However, to reinforce what has been said already, we hope that the police will rarely find it necessary to use that discretionary power. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both amendments are in my name; I am afraid that I have been active on the Bill. They deal with a narrower point, which I raised on Second Reading. When a constable approaches a young person on the street or in a public place and seeks to take from him a bottle or a can, the constable does not know whether it contains intoxicating liquor. I fear that there will be challenges to the constable's power on that basis. It is easy to envisage a group of young people deliberately filling lager cans with lemonade and arguing with a constable that they are not drinking lager but filled up their cans at home. That leaves the constable with the duty to decide, on the strength of his suspicion, whether the cans contain intoxicating liquor. If he decides that they do, he removes the drink from the young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the constable will have the power to do the sensible thing and pour the drink down the nearest drain, because the Bill creates an assumption that a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
young person will challenge the accusation that it is intoxicating liquor. Indeed, he may defend himself in court by arguing that the liquor, say, exhibit A, is not what was in the can in the first place or even if it was, he may say, "The court will find, m'lud, that it is just lemonade". I want to encourage constables to dispose of the offending substance as quickly as possible. I accept that the amendment may be defective—I am an amateur draftsman—but by empowering a constable not to have to prove that the liquor is intoxicating, we make it easier for the police to use the powers in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Under clause 1, a police constable has to be satisfied that the young person or the adult with whom the young person is associating is in possession of intoxicating liquor. None of the powers to dispose of any material that might be surrendered to him could therefore be exercised unless that precondition was met.

However, my purpose in introducing the amendment was not to give the police the duty to form a view on whether the drink was intoxicating liquor; I was trying to deal with what happens once the police have formed that view and removed the liquor. I want to remove from the police the threat of subsequent challenge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, the hon. Gentleman is looking for problems that I suspect do not exist. We need to remind ourselves that the power of the police constable under clause 1 can be exercised when he has a reasonable suspicion, which is all that he would need to establish in court, were that power to be challenged. There are many other branches of the criminal law where we can look for evidence; we can see how it strikes the right balance between the need to prove something as a fact and the need to confirm that the police officer might have been entitled to act in such a way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill refers simply to a police officer having reasonable suspicion, which is all that would need to be established in a court if the power of confiscation was challenged. It would not need to be established that the material being confiscated was intoxicating liquor, only that the police constable had a reasonable suspicion that it was intoxicating liquor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may be experiencing the sensation that many Opposition Members have experienced for sometime: whenever we draft an amendment, a Conservative Member says that it is technically deficient. We have lived with that experience for many years and I hope that it will be more widely shared among Conservative Members in future; it would do them a lot of good. The hon. Gentleman's worries are not justified. I accept that he has a well-motivated reason for protecting police
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
constables from such action. Indeed, none of us want the police to be entrapped into expensive litigation in connection with what most of us, if we were being honest with ourselves, would say was a relatively small issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, East was right to say that, although the issue might be small, it affects the quality of life of many of our constituents. In parts of my constituency, acute problems are caused by young adults consuming intoxicating liquor in public; it can make life a misery for residents and small shopkeepers. Shopkeepers have complained to me that the presence of young adults getting partly drunk outside their premises acts as a significant deterrent to potential customers. People do not want to go into the shops because they do not want to pass an intimidating picket line of people. We must solve the problem, which is why I am happy to support the Bill and why I am one of its sponsors. The hon. Member for Bristol, North-West is making a problem out of nothing and I hope that he withdraws the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West. They are grouped together, but most of his comments related to amendment No. 4. I believe that amendment No. 5 is more important; it would require a constable not to dispose of intoxicating liquor
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he is at the time made aware that it may not be intoxicating liquor".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not withdraw amendment No. 5, despite the assurances that he may receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We deal with community police officers who understand the problems in the neighbourhood and realise that it is important to work with young people rather than to create confrontations. In my experience, the outraged residents to whom various members of the Committee have referred and for whom the behaviour of young people causes such problems, often point their fingers at community police officers and accuse them of being too soft in their approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also had experience of police officers who take a different approach. Some young people in inner-Liverpool in the 1970s thought that the police force behaved like an occupying army rather than a force seeking to work with the consent of the community, with its wider interests at heart. Police officers should not be given powers to act unreasonably. If, under the Bill, a police officer is given the power to confiscate what appears to be alcohol, he will have the power to dispose of what may prove to be orangeade, even though the young person may tell him, "But it is not alcohol, it is orangeade". The young person will see the constable pouring it down the drain before his eyes, effectively destroying evidence and blackening his character. That will result in a sense of injustice and feelings of hostility building up between young people and police officers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Youngsters are quite devious, clever and boisterous. If they know that they can frustrate a police constable simply by saying, "This is not alcohol" when they have tipped some lager into a can of orange juice—or even by saying. "Although this is in an alcopop

bottle, it is actually orange juice"—they will do so. That will frustrate the purpose of the Bill; the police will be frustrated and unable to prevent youngsters from falling under the influence of drink. We will have betrayed youngsters by not passing a simple, clear and commonsense Bill that is easy to apply. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will think again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am sorry—I reject that. We cannot build injustice into the system. I do not accept the impression that has been given that all young people are by nature devious and will constantly try to deceive local police officers by trying it on and saying that the content of a bottle of cider is not cider. Even if that were the case, certain principles of natural justice must remain constant. One such principle is that police officers should not be able simply to dispose of evidence. If necessary, they should take the container back to the police station, where it will be held and labelled, and can be analysed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to point out to the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) that the Government are always willing carefully to consider amendments that have been tabled. It is not true that we always want to reject them on some technicality. Indeed, although my hon. Friend the member for Bristol, North-West said that he was only an amateur draftsman, the Government are grateful to him for discovering a loophole that could affect the workability of the Bill. Amendment No. 4 has not been drafted in an amateur way; it is impressive, and we do not reject it for technical or other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend rightly said that the Bill as drafted states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A constable may dispose of intoxicating liquor surrendered to him…in such a manner as he consider appropriate."</p></blockquote>
The Bill does not make provision for him to dispose of a drink that he wrongly believes to be intoxicating. Amendment No. 4 would take care of that deficiency by ensuring that an officer may dispose of anything surrendered to him. The Government support the amendment, and we arc grateful to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, although I have applauded my hon. Friend for amendment No. 4, I cannot applaud amendment No. 5, which loses sight of what is practical. If accepted, it would mean that the officer could dispose of intoxicating liquor in any way that he thought appropriate unless—this has already been referred to by members of the Committee—he had been made aware of the fact that it may not be intoxicating liquor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure is not mandatory; police officers will retain the discretion to require the surrender of drinks when they feel that that is the right thing to do. It has already been made abundantly clear—I think that we all knew this anyway—that if a family were picnicking and a youngster had a sip of wine, the police would not have a duty to step in and confiscate the wine. The same would apply were the youngster sipping, not wine, but a drink that might or might not be Buck's Fizz.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not trying to make life impossible for families who are enjoying a perfectly respectable picnic. Let us consider the circumstances. A group of youngsters in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
bus shelter appears to be the worse for drink. They have been shouting insults at passers-by and are holding cans of lager. The officer might well believe that those are circumstances in which he should intervene. He has the power under subsection (1) to require the surrender of those cans of lager. By confiscating them, he will hopefully prevent the situation from getting completely out of hand; his action may also stop the youngsters from becoming even more intoxicated and perhaps from fighting or doing anything more damaging in the location.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his usual courtesy in giving way. I am surprised that the Government are prepared to accept the amendment. Will the Minister confirm that a police constable must have a reasonable suspicion that the substance being disposed of is intoxicating liquor? The concerns expressed by other members of the Committee, including the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West, would not be satisfied by our accepting the amendment as the Minister proposes, because that would not deal with whether the substance were intoxicating liquor. The constable has to show reasonable suspicion that the material being disposed of is intoxicating liquor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that the constable must have a reasonable suspicion; we have already debated the level of reasonableness. That does not prevent me from accepting amendment No. 4, which I believe would be helpful in the circumstances that are being described. It is possible that, even if the police officer's suspicion is reasonable—which is all it need be—and he has behaved properly, the liquor could turn out not to be intoxicating. Without amendment No. 4, he would not be able to dispose of it, and I believe that he should have that power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the circumstances in which one of the youngsters does not want to hand over his drink. He has managed to get a friend to buy it for him—we hope that the friend is over 18—and he is now enjoying it. If amendment No. 5 were accepted, that youngster would soon know that all he had to do to render a police officer powerless was to protest that the drink was not lager but something else. The amendment states that an officer would not be able to dispose of the drink if he is
	<br><blockquote><p>"made aware that it may not be intoxicating liquor".</p></blockquote>
Indeed, the youngster need not even assert that the drink is not liquor; he can simply say that it might not be. That would very much restrict the legitimate activities of a police officer in those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the development of alcopops and other designer liquors that are geared to juvenile tastes and look like nothing we have seen before? I shall not go through their names—they are quite incredible and awful. There are also nonalcoholic beers. All those create further difficulties: the youngster will claim that his drink is not intoxicating; the industry has disguised the drink as non-alcoholic; the police constable may not have come across it before but will have to make a decision, and that will become increasingly difficult for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V002P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made no secret of my views—I emphasise that they are personal—on alcopops. I think that they are very dangerous. I welcome the Portman Group's interest in the matter and the fact that it has taken action on one or two of the products. I am seriously concerned about the way in which those drinks are being developed by the industry and agree that they cause confusion. We want the police to have as much discretion as possible, and the matter that my hon. Friend raises is another reason for not restricting matters too closely. I hope that the industry takes note of the fact that new developments can have negative effects in respect of young people and alcohol.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude my remarks by saying that I hope that the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West will be pleased that we are happy to accept amendment No. 4 if that is the Committee's wish. I also hope that he will understand my reasons for recommending that the Committee resist amendment No. 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, this has been a constructive debate and I assure the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness that those of us who are not lawyers—on whichever side of the Committee we sit—are so used to having our amendments rejected on technical grounds that it becomes almost second nature to assume that that will happen. Obviously, I am delighted that the Minister supports my amendment on this occasion, rather than what the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness and I would have expected, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that on whichever side of the Committee he sits, the same thing will happen to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Littleborough and Saddleworth for making the case for my amendment No. 5 much more effectively than I did. I agree that there is a risk that under the clause, as drafted, a policeman who is not sure about his reasonable suspicion that he has just confiscated an alcoholic drink will take the opportunity to destroy the evidence, in fear that he will be proved wrong in a subsequent court case. I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman that that is not a provision that should be lightly imported into the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, on balance, I am inclined to go along with the comments of my hon. Friend the Minister that to follow the strict civil libertarian argument, which he and I have been putting forward, might be right in principle, but would make the law much more difficult to apply in practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chris Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is moving towards withdrawing his amendment. I believe that in the interchange between the police officer and the young person, any pretence would be quickly eliminated if the officer made it clear that to carry the pretence much further would count against that young person. I listened with interest to the hon. Member for Castle Point—especially his remarks on alcopops, which were well made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Littleborough and Saddleworth realised, I am inclined to give the Minister his head on amendment No. 5. I shall not press amendment No. 5, but as the Minister raised the subject,
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I want to defend a strong industry in my constituency. Not all alcopops are designed to avoid the law; some are greatly enjoyed by young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 2, line 6, after "any", insert "substantial".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a narrow amendment, which I suspect will be clarified by a one or two sentence reply from the Minister. By using the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"any section of the public",</p></blockquote>
the Bill could be referring to an individual. Clearly, any place could be defined as a public place, as the Bill stands, if only one individual is in it. The insertion of the word "substantial" may be legally unsound, but I shall be interested to hear my hon. Friend's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the amendment would restrict the power that the Bill confers on the police to seize alcohol from people under 18. I cannot therefore recommend that the Committee accept it. As the hon. Gentleman said, it would limit the definition of a public place to a place to which a substantial section of the public had access. I shall give an example of what that would mean. As hon. Members know, entrance to various playgrounds is restricted to children and accompanying adults; most sections of the public would therefore not be able to enter such playgrounds and would not come within the amendment's definition of a public place. However, it is lawful for children to enter such playgrounds, which would mean that persons under 18 could, if the amendment were passed, drink intoxicating liquor in them and the police might not be able to seize it from them. I could give many more such examples to show that in practice the amendment would have the opposite effect to what my hon. Friend intends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way—I assume that he was giving way, rather than just sitting down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what my hon. Friend said, but I hope that he will consider the reverse side of the coin which is ensuring that the Bill does not make every square inch of the United Kingdom a public place if a person is in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Better lawyers than me can give an accurate definition of "public place", a term which has been used in various legal cases and arguments for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also mean that a police officer had to decide whether the proportion of the public admitted to a public place was substantial. That seems an invidious responsibility to place on the shoulders of a police officer, at a time when he needs to take fast action to alleviate a nuisance or difficult situation—the whole purpose of the legislation. I hope that, on that basis, my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a non-lawyer, I am not aware of the body of legal opinion on the definition of a public place and I was not aware of it when I drafted the amendment. I am therefore happy to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of making a wide-ranging speech on clause 1; I suspect that you, Sir James, would not allow me to do so, as we have already discussed most matters in it. Only one aspect of the clause has not been discussed—the level of penalty in clause 1(3). The Bill is intended to reinforce community policing without increasing court work, as is suggested in the explanatory memorandum. Local magistrates have told me that they hope never to hear a single case under the Bill. Therefore, it is somewhat excessive that the Bill provides for a fine of up to £500. I should be like my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point or my hon. Friend the Minister to comment on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It would be a failure if any such case went to court. Our intention is that young people will not go to court or get a criminal record under the Bill. However, the Bill must have some teeth to be effective. An effective sanction must be able to be applied to prevent young people from frustrating the purpose of the Bill and, therefore, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
intention of the House to protect not only the young people themselves, but communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the courts will use their judgment to decide the appropriate level of sanction. The courts need not necessarily impose a level-2 fine; they will apply justice with sensitivity, integrity and understanding of individual circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely good point. We all know that some older people take vans to France, fill them with cheap beer, return to this country and supply it to young people for profit, and we need to be able to control such actions. Level 2 represents a low fine. However, cases would go to court only if there were a serious dispute with the police. In such cases, the courts might have to deal with serious matters, so I want to retain this level of sanction. I hope that my hon.
