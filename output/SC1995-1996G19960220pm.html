	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following this morning's lengthy debate on the principles of a licensing scheme as opposed to a registration scheme, we move to more detailed consideration of the contents of such a scheme. Amendments Nos. 212 and 213 are in a sense a halfway house between that which the Government espoused and we advocated this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government argued that there should not be a mandatory national licensing scheme. We believe that they are wrong but if that is what they think, and if they seriously accept that effective action must be taken to improve standards and tackle problems in unsatisfactory properties, we hope that they will appreciate the logic of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 212 would require the registration scheme to be mandatory. Amendment No. 213 would allow a local housing authority to apply to the Secretary of State for exemption from that requirement if it could demonstrate, from the number and condition of houses in multiple occupation in its area, and from the action that it is taking to deal with such problems, that licensing would not be justified. That would achieve the benefits of a mandatory national framework, for which we argued, while allowing exemptions to authorities. It
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
would allow the Secretary of State to take a view on the performance of local authorities. That may help the Minister of State, who this morning expressed concern about the Government's ability to enforce legislation. They would be able to take an overview of authorities' performance and either agree exemptions if they believe authorities are in control and do not require a national scheme, or require them to adopt a national scheme if Ministers are not satisfied. That might be regarded as a compromise between our positions this morning, when the Government rejected our amendment. I hope that they will have second thoughts this afternoon and realise the merits of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Diane Maddock 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Christchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will not have missed the fact that one of my amendments is similar to amendment No. 212. My second amendment goes a little further than that tabled by the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mr. Raynsford).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 245 would make mandatory a registration scheme for local authorities for houses in multiple occupation. Amendment No. 246 goes with it, setting out the procedure through which authorities apply for exemption. Where I differ from the Government is that while they prefer that local authorities opt in, I think that it is much better to make the scheme mandatory and allow them to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We support a compulsory national registration scheme. We have consulted local authorities throughout the country and it is clear that they want the scheme to be mandatory. We are worried that if the schemes are not mandatory, varying policies and enforcement practices will exist in different local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Differences and inconsistencies, which sometimes seem arbitrary, make it difficult for landlords to plan expenditure on their properties. Later, we shall discuss opt-outs of specific properties from various registration schemes—that is worrying. Amendment No. 245 would remove local authorities' discretion to do that, but it would give them the power to apply for an exemption, for which there should be a clear procedure. Amendment No. 246 sets out such a procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New subsection (7), which the amendment would incorporate in the clause, sets out the information that local authorities would need to provide to support their applications, which would include the total number and type of houses in multiple occupation in a local authority's area. It might seek exemption because it had few properties and was able to control them. Many members of the Committee are concerned about control of houses in multiple occupation. Some local authorities might want to be exempt because they provided services to tenants and landlords without needing to be part of a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an application for exemption, we would also like a local authority to state how many houses in multiple occupation meet the standards set in section 352(1)(a) of the Housing Act 1985 for amenities such as toilets, baths, showers, cooking facilities, means of escape from fire and other fire precautions. That information is crucial. A local authority would have to show that it had accurate information about the extent of substandard conditions and poor management in its area. Even if the information showed that a high proportion of houses in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>239</span>
multiple occupation were unsatisfactory, the local authority might be exempted on the next criterion, which is a written strategy document to show that it has an active, forward-looking programme for tackling substandard houses in multiple occupation. That would be a thorough test for local authorities that sought exemption. They would have to show that their strategy for tackling problems was proactive, that their programme was comprehensive and made the best use of their enforcement powers, and that they encouraged and supported responsible landlords to maintain their properties in good order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Campaign for Bedsit Rights carried out extensive research, in which it was supported by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Out of the 169 local authorities it considered in England and Wales, 51 per cent. had a written strategy that detailed policies and practices for houses in multiple occupation. The Department of the Environment commissioned research in 1995. On the basis of that study, nearly two thirds of local authorities have a structured approach to houses in multiple occupation and some written strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal is prescriptive in its requirements of local authorities' applications for exemption, but it is a good way of dealing with an important issue. We must ensure that local authorities are given the tools to do their job. They have asked for schemes to be mandatory, but we appreciate that some local authorities may have a good case for exemption. It would have to be a good case, as the amendment makes clear. If they have a good case, perhaps they should be allowed to be exempt, but it would be the exception for them to be allowed to opt out. This morning the Government were saying that they would set up a scheme into which they hoped that all local authorities would opt. My party—and, I think, many members of the Committee—believes that the amendment provides a much better way to move forward and ensure better conditions in houses in multiple occupation. This morning, the conditions in which some people lived were graphically described. We all want to tackle that; we must find the best way to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Greenwich is as persuasive as ever, but it is only fair for me to tell him that I am no more persuaded by this amendment than by the lengthy debate on the previous one. I say that to the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mrs. Maddock) because the previous amendments were given lengthy consideration; perhaps the Committee will be minded not to spend too long on this group before we move on. This morning, we debated a group of amendments that would have altered the clause to make it read
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every local authority may make a licensing scheme".</p></blockquote>
Now we are discussing something that is, as the hon. Gentleman said, more of a halfway house—the opt-out version. I fail to see how the amendments would be any more or less non-mandatory than were the amendments that we discussed this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that I found unconvincing the Opposition's argument this morning that "licensing", as
	<span class='label label-info column'>240</span>
a semantic alternative to "registration"—that was what the debate was all about, apart from the argument that the man in Marsham street knew better—was different from what we were proposing. After all, we did not disagree about the powers involved. It emerged that Opposition Members could not trust local government to tackle the problem that it had done as much as anyone to identify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat what I said before lunch: as has been mentioned, many councils are in Labour, Liberal or Liberal-Labour control. Do Opposition Members want to name their councils whom they do not trust to fulfil their obligations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So they want to name their own councils, do they? I give way to the hon. Member for Bradford [
	<i>Laughter.</i>] I mean the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister—before he starts naming councils—that I am from Birmingham. Does the Minister presume that local authorities would normally have a registration scheme? If so, will he tell us the circumstances in which it would be appropriate for them not to have a scheme, and does he think that they should be able to make a case for not having one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answer to that question, I think that, armed with the much-improved powers provided in the Bill, most councils will have a registration scheme. However, I want to leave it to local councils to choose exactly how they use the opportunities provided by the Bill, because I believe that they are most sensitive to local priorities and circumstances. I do not think that the man from Marsham street knows best.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So if the Minister thinks that most local authorities would have a registration scheme, should those that do not be able to make a case for not having one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why cannot the hon. Gentleman accept instead our argument that they can make the case for not having one by choosing as locally-elected representatives, and in the best interests of their local community how to take up the opportunities that the Bill will give them? What the hon. Gentleman tries to pose as a question will be given to them by the Bill as drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying philosophically to explore the arguments of the hon. Member for Greenwich. I was

	<span class='label label-info column'>241</span>
asking him whether he meant that he did not trust local government and whether he considered that councils that did not fulfil their obligations under the opportunities that we shall provide would be rogue councils. I even asked the hon. Gentleman how, if he was so concerned about rogue councils, he would police them, but he gave no answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Ashby 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-West Leicestershire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot think of anywhere in my constituency where there is property in multi-occupation. Is there any purpose in setting up a register in such circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The heart of the matter is to trust local authorities on that question. We shall provide them with the powers, which they have generally welcomed. There is no disagreement in the Committee or outside it about those powers, which will give us the opportunity to move forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the hon. Gentleman before he feels too frustrated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to bring the Under-Secretary back home to Wales. The hon. Gentleman asked my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich to answer about rogue councils, but we are talking about councils that either will not or cannot fund a proper scheme. Shelter and the Welsh Council—with which the hon. Gentleman is familiar—have said that local authorities do not have the resources to respond to the problems that they face at the moment. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich is talking about giving powers to local authorities and the resources to implement them. The issue is not rogue councils but those that want to do a good job, yet do not have the resources. That is the point that Welsh district councils in my constituency and in that of the hon. Gentlemen are making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman—who represents a Welsh constituency, as I have the pleasure to do—will contain his impatience, he would discover that we shall shortly come to the measures dealing with the fees that can be levied. Those fees are pertinent to providing councils with resources that they will not obtain unless they have implemented a registration scheme, which will enable them to charge the fees. That is further encouragement for them to act as we would largely like them to do—which, in turn, will bring them the resources that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been reflecting on a point, which the hon. Member for Christchurch made this morning, that I found most illuminating. She said that the scheme must be mandatory, as that will mean that councils are more likely to do what they ought to do. That is an informal approach to a mandatory scheme. In my simple language, mandatory means that something must be done or not done. On reflection, I felt that the hon. Lady was tacitly admitting something about which I have been trying to question Labour Members—that it will make precious little or no difference whether a scheme is mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was exactly the point of my contribution. Councils are much more likely to do something that is mandatory. If a scheme is discretionary and councils have a choice, they may not implement it because of other pressures on them. Many heads were nodding when I made that point, as Committee members agree with me. Councillors find it difficult to get away with not observing a mandatory requirement, whereas they can get away with not doing something that is discretionary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady strengthens her argument but, to take her words at face value, her concept of a mandatory national scheme does not involve certainty and is not an automatic arrangement. She claims that, at best, a mandatory scheme will make councils that she does not trust do that which we want them to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Sykes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend find it extraordinary that a leading practitioner of a party that practices pavement politics should have so much contempt for local voters that she believes that they might not be able to make their minds up whether a local authority is behaving rightly or wrongly in implementing such a scheme? Is not that a case of Liberal Democrat double standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might even be trying to suggest that is saying one thing, but doing another. The Opposition's proposal is the natural tendency of the centralisers—those who would take power unto themselves—whereas we want to practise real devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other main point of my argument was that local authorities have requested such a scheme. I am the first person to want local authorities to have the powers that they want. The overwhelming majority of them want the powers—that is why, as a Liberal Democrat, I am in favour of them. I have consulted people who run our housing committees up and down the country and they would like the powers to be mandatory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Lady says. I appreciate that she hopes that that would mean a greater likelihood, but it would mean no more than that. The Opposition have not proved the case that a mandatory scheme would change what we are doing in any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under current legislation, local authorities have discretion over whether to use registration schemes. If they want to, they require the Secretary of State's approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Betts 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Attercliffe)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Under-Secretary up on his point that we have not proven anything? He believes that registration schemes are a good idea and will benefit tenants in areas where they are applied. Surely, by definition, he must believe that tenants will miss out in areas where registration schemes are not applied, but they would be applied if we had a mandatory system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost surprised at the hon. Gentleman; I believe that he had no small career in local government. I was in local government for many years
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
before coming to the House. The difference between us is that I place much more trust and confidence in local government. Perhaps, as most of local government is controlled by Labour and the Liberals, the Opposition know their own and do not trust them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Under-Secretary mind responding to the point that I put to him rather than ignoring it again? If registration schemes are, 
	<i>per se,</i> a good idea that would benefit tenants, would not tenants under the scheme that he is proposing be disadvantaged as some would not have a registration scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily. It will be a matter of judgment for the local authorities, which are in the best position to make that judgment.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am explaining that if local authorities seek to introduce a registration scheme at present they require the Secretary of State's consent.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I take it from that that if a local authority wants to introduce a scheme it must have the consent of the Secretary of State? [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Now then, one Minister is saying no and the other is saying yes. Who is right? If that is so, the Secretary of State can veto a scheme if he feels that a local authority should not introduce it. Does that show the confidence in local government to which the Minister has referred? Why does that happen if the Minister is so confident in local government?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer, if the hon. Gentleman listens, is that currently local authorities require the Secretary of State's consent, which is invariably given, particularly where local authorities use the Department of the Environment model scheme. Under the Bill, consent will not be needed if local authorities follow the model scheme. The desire is common to us all to have the concept of a model scheme that makes it easier for local authorities to pick up registration schemes and take them forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would change the position. All local authorities would be required to operate a registration scheme for HMOs unless they could convince the Secretary of State that they were justified
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
in not having one. That goes unnecessarily far in dictating to local authorities how they tackle HMO issues. Many local authorities, but not all, operate registration schemes, which they find effective in identifying HMOs and working towards improved standards, where necessary. Some believe such schemes are unnecessarily bureaucratic; given the circumstances of their areas and information from other sources, they think that it is not worthwhile to operate a registration scheme. It is important that local authorities, which have the best knowledge of local situations, should take the decision. I urge members of the Committee not to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Elletson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blackpool, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree with me that tackling the problem puts a great strain on local authorities? Authorities such as Blackpool borough council in my constituency, would have to deal with 2,000 or 3,000 HMOs catering for 10,000 to 12,000 tenants, most of whom come from outside the borough but who nevertheless would have to be housed by the authority. That would create enormous stresses and strains. Clearly the matter must be dealt with sensitively by phasing in, and the local authority must be allowed the necessary flexibility and discretion. It is nonsense to suppose that the problem could be solved by imposing a mandatory licensing scheme on the local authority. Opposition Members are living in cloud cuckoo land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Blackpool borough council and other local authorities need and deserve the discretion of our proposal. They will have the opportunity and the necessary powers. They should not have to worry about whether the man from Marsham Street knows best and whether they would be allowed to opt out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to clarify one or two points for the Under-Secretary, who seemed unclear about whether what the amendment proposed was less mandatory than the national licensing scheme that we advocated earlier. It should have been clear that a scheme that allows a local authority to seek and be given an exemption is less mandatory than a scheme that requires all local authorities to operate it. That is the difference, and that is the basis on which we propose the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary argued that the difference between us is merely semantics. In later debates, when we consider the scope of the registration scheme, it will be clear that what we are discussing is not semantics but which of a large number of properties will fall within the ambit of the scheme. There is great anxiety on both sides of the House that certain properties, which the Government's proposals would leave out, should not be omitted. The issue concerns real people with real problems, not semantics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary had to keep a straight face and have his tongue firmly in his cheek to argue that the Government respect the wishes of local government and allow it discretion. The Under-Secretary's argument would be more persuasive if we did not know that the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration consulted local authorities and others in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
England about the principle of a national licensing scheme. In England, 92 per cent. of housing authorities said that they wanted a national licensing scheme. The Under-Secretary may like to say whether there was a similar response in Wales. A Government who listened to local authorities and did what they asked would have introduced the scheme that the local authorities demanded. We will take no lessons from the Undersecretary about listening to local authorities. We listened to them; we know what they want and we propose that type of scheme. It is unfortunate that, once again, the Under-Secretary is blocking our proposals for a sensible scheme that would mean more effective coverage and reduce the risk of injury or loss of life resulting from failure to control conditions in some of the worst quality, most dangerous housing in the country. That is the difference between us and that is why we support the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arguments that the Opposition advanced in this morning's debate and this afternoon were wholly spurious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We increasingly find that local authorities are not prepared to exercise the discretion for which their councillors are elected. I am even finding that with my own, well-run council, which always wants the Government to bail it out of difficult planning decisions. The amendment is another example of the Labour party not wanting its own Labour councils to take the difficult discretionary decisions for which their councillors are elected. If the Opposition parties want a mandatory scheme or an opt-out, we are entitled to know which of their councils they do not trust. Do not they trust Sheffield, Newham, Tower Hamlets, Bradford, Islington or Christchurch councils?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have proposed a perfectly workable mechanism to allow councils to opt in to a licensing scheme that is properly set out in the Bill. The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) was being mischievous. If councils want to use a normal scheme, they will not need my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's approval—they can get on and do so. If they consider that there is a problem with houses in multiple occupation, they will have every opportunity of opting in to the Government's scheme. Why does everything have to be mandatory? There is a local democratic system in this country, and we should let it work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 217, in page 34, leave out lines 11 and 12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A moment ago, we heard from the Under-Secretary that local government should be given more devolved powers. He said that the Government trust local authorities and want to give them more scope. We now come up against the exact opposite—a series of provisions that give no discretion whatever to local authorities and require them not to register certain properties, even though those properties may clearly be in poor condition and in need of improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment—which will be an interesting test of the Minister's consistency—is designed, as are subsequent amendments, to give local authorities greater flexibility in deciding which properties should be registered. I shall be most interested to hear the Minister's response. The amendment is concerned with the first of the exclusions in clause 62. As the Bill stands, a series of types of property is excluded from registration. The first type to which the Bill says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A registration scheme shall not apply"</p></blockquote>
is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a house which is occupied by persons who form only two households".</p></blockquote>
I grant the Minister that in most cases, houses occupied by only two households will not be major problems compared with HMOs with a series of households, but there will be cases where houses containing only two households could be highly problematic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider two possibilities. First, a house could be occupied by two extended households comprising a large number of individuals. Such a property could contain 20 individuals living in a series of small rooms, in circumstances identical to those that would apply in the more traditional HMO. That is perfectly conceivable. Are we to believe that the local authority will be debarred from registering such a property, even though the risks might be identical to those in the more traditional HMO? That would be the effect of the Bill. That exclusion takes no account of the state of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us envisage a second possibility—a large and disgusting multi-occupied house with squalid conditions and dangerous appliances. The property clearly merits action, but on the date when the local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
authority approaches the owner, there are only two households in it—either because the owner, knowing that registration is coming, has chucked out all the others or because there has been a flood, fire or some other unpleasantness, as a result of which most of the people who would normally be resident in the property are not there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister looks closely at the clause, he will see that it refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a house which is occupied by persons who form only two households".</p></blockquote>
not to a house that is normally occupied by only two households. If there are only two households in a house on the date of registration, even if it is a disgusting slum that clearly deserves to be registered, a local authority could, according to the current phrasing of the Bill, be debarred from registering it. That would clearly be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is genuine in his concern to devolve power to local authorities, allow flexibility and be sensible about the matter, the subsection cannot remain in the Bill in its current form. The Minister may say that our wording is defective—although we are not in fact proposing any wording at all. We are simply proposing to delete subsection (2)(a).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ashby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be wrong, but my understanding of the provision is that when there are more than two households and when there is a registration scheme, the property would become registrable. It is not a matter of there being a specific time for registration; the use to which the house is put makes it registrable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we discuss the subsequent amendments, we shall see that, in practice, there are other exclusions, too. I hope that the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (Mr. Ashby) will take what I am about to say seriously. If the local authority says that it proposes to register the property and the owner can demonstrate that only two households live there, the owner can say to the local authority, "Go away. This house should not be registered."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision provides an obvious loophole that would enable an unscrupulous owner or landlord to avoid registration by removing all the tenants other than two households when the local authority says that the register is being compiled. I accept that, in general, properties containing only two households would not usually come within the registration scheme that we regard as appropriate. We are not arguing that each house that contains only two households should automatically be registered. That policy would probably be too rigid. We are saying that the exclusion provision, as currently drafted, is too strict. It will prevent certain properties that, on any common sense grounds, should be registered as multi-occupied houses from being so registered. That is what we object to, which is why I made the offer to the Minister to consider alternative phrasing. The principle behind the amendment is sound and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be more accommodating now than he was on the previous amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been so much discussion today about the eponymous man from Marsham Street that I rise with a real sense of bashfulness to respond to the amendment. We might be able to accommodate some issues this afternoon, but this is not one of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, we are discussing exclusions and where the thresholds should bite in the registration schemes. As is inevitable, we have sought to strike a balance when defining high risk. The hon. Gentleman said that the definition of an HMO is wide: it is a house occupied by people who do not form one household. Whether they do so is often a matter of circumstance. When referring to HMOs, most people think of a hostel or a house comprising bed sitters. Depending on precise living arrangements, a family taking a lodger could make its home an HMO. A house converted into two self-contained, owner-occupied flats is certainly an HMO even if it is only occupied by two people in total. We reckon that there are about 600,000 HMOs in England and about 21,000 in Wales. Therefore, the issue under discussion is where the control provision bites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, a balance must be struck. Although local authorities have a discretionary power under existing legislation to take enforcement action against all HMOs, the requirements for registration and control schemes should apply to a smaller number of HMOs when the risks are likely to be greater. That approach is reflected in existing legislation. Indeed, most authorities that have adopted registration schemes have excluded smaller HMOs. The exclusions under new subsection 346(2)(a)—I quote that because the hon. Gentleman has a biblical knowledge of housing legislation—is based on one of the standard exclusions in the Government's non-statutory model schemes that have stood the test of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that local authorities will have chosen not to include those properties in their registration schemes, but he is now proposing that authorities will have no right to include such properties in the scheme, even if they so choose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present law effectively allows local authorities to make a list of HMOs. That is what the registration scheme amounts to in practice, and their powers to take action flow from different legislation. We are moving towards a scheme that will give a permissive power to a local authority to introduce wide-ranging control measures if it chooses to opt into the scheme. It is common consent that an overwhelming majority of local authorities will do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall come later to an amendment that will give sharply increased powers to local authorities, when particular circumstances apply. They will be subject to approval by the Secretary of State, as a safeguard to such draconian powers when a clear case has been made. Under the main body of the scheme, if there are problematic properties, the local authority will not lose its discretionary powers under section 352 to enforce the exclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>249</span>
My objection to the amendment is that it takes me a cut too low. It would bring in an unnecessary range of properties. I accept that there may be extraordinary or exceptional circumstances, as outlined by the hon. Member for Greenwich, but there will always be some examples that fall below the line that is drawn. That is a factor in all legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been doing some research into the identification of factors contributing in particular to the risk of fire in HMOs. A feasibility study has been completed and experience shows that the categories of HMOs that we propose to exclude from registration are genuinely low risk, but when that research is completed, we shall be able to apply more directly secondary legislation that may be made using the powers in section 365 of the 1985 Act, amended by clause 70 of the Bill.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now discover, to my considerable embarrassment, that the problem was not the sequence but my own failure—I had marked my notes amendment No. 187, rather than amendment No. 183. I offer an unreserved apology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
Amendment No. 183 deals with the second of the main exclusions from the registration scheme—houses
	<br><blockquote><p>"occupied by no more than four persons who form more than two households.</p></blockquote>
The previous paragraph excluded houses containing only two households; this one covers properties containing more than two households, but no more than four people in total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The presumption, I suspect, is that those are smaller HMOs where there is less likely to be a risk of fire, poor conditions, poor management, and so on. There is little or no evidence to substantiate such a presumption. Excluding smaller HMOs from registration is not justified by the evidence available from local authorities all over the country which have examined the matter closely. Let me give some examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Brighton estimated in 1994 that 50 per cent. of all unfit dwellings in its area were properties with three or fewer habitable rooms. That represented 40 per cent. of all private dwellings in Brighton. That is a pretty devastating figure, suggesting a concentration of poor conditions in the smaller HMOs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The latest estimates from Sheffield suggest that 63 per cent. of HMOs there contain four households or fewer. My hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe may wish to provide further information. That is a dramatic figure revealing that almost two thirds of the HMOs in Sheffield are smaller properties. That reflects the nature of the area and the type of housing—relatively small terraced housing and semi-detached housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the latest estimates, one third of all HMOs in Leicester contain fewer than four people or only two households.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence from Nottingham is that the city has an increasing incidence of HMOs associated with the student population—there are two universities there—and the lack of adequate numbers of halls of residence. Hence, there are great pressures on local housing stock, resulting in the increasing use of small terraced houses and flats above shops to provide multi-occupied housing for students, typically housing up to four people. More disturbingly, I am informed from Nottingham that there have been several instances where the fire service has had to serve prohibition notices to secure the safety of tenants in such accommodation. The council reports many examples of poor or non-existent management and a lack of fire escapes and other fire precautions, and it concludes that exactly the same problems occur in smaller HMOs as in larger HMOs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last examples that I shall quote are from Cambridge, where a recent case involved a three-storey property comprising a hairdresser's shop on the ground floor and two floors above that which housed three tenants. During a fire, the tenants had to leave the property through the kitchen because there was no protected escape route. In another case in Cambridge, a three-storey property with four tenants had the back door sealed shut by the landlord, with no protected escape route or alarm system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are clear, worrying examples of serious risks to people resulting from inadequate precautions against fire. All those properties would be likely to fail the test under the clause. The amendment would remove that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
restriction. There is no logic in the restriction; it does not relate only to lower risk properties, it simply makes a judgment based on the size of a property. I hope that I have demonstrated that size is not a necessary guarantee of the condition or safety of a property. The clause pays no regard to the risks and hazards that may exist in such properties, nor to their condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is not amended, subsection (2) will reduce dramatically the number of properties that can be covered in a registration scheme. If local authorities had the discretion to choose whether or not to include such properties, that might not be quite so serious, but it does not. Contrary to the assurances given by the Minister of State about listening to local authorities, devolving power to them and giving them more say, the Bill effectively prohibits them from registering such properties. They are not allowed to do so, no matter how bad the condition, no matter how serious the risk. They will be prevented from registering such properties. That is wrong—any reasonable person would sense that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to get the Government out of an impossible position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they do not accept it, they will be prohibiting local authorities from taking action to register properties that are known to be a serious risk, as I have shown in some of the examples that I have cited. There is no logic in the Government's position. I hope, in this case, that they will take a more conciliatory line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend's comments and ask Ministers to think again on the matter. We can certainly throw back at Ministers their words about the Government's desire to ensure that local authorities are given the right to choose whether a registration scheme is applicable. The clause would remove the local authorities' right to choose whether to register HMOs with four residents or fewer. Local authorities would no longer have the right to register small HMOs, and would not be able to ensure that the horrors mentioned in our debate and the appalling conditions that can exist even in smaller properties did not continue. Local authorities would be able to take no effective action in such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich has already said, Sheffield has an efficient and conscientious housing department, which deals with the private sector despite the fact that it is always short of resources. The housing department has said that 63 per cent. of the HMOs in the city have four or fewer residents. That means that 63 per cent. of HMOs will not be included in the scheme. That is not the local authority's choice, nor will it lead to an effective registration scheme. That is precisely what my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich said about Nottingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Due to the expansion of both universities, Sheffield now has more than 30,000 students. The city welcomes those students and the growth of the universities; it is an important source of income for the city. However, the halls of residence have not grown, so students have moved into larger houses. Those houses are now full, so
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
students are now moving into smaller terraced houses. Often four students live in two or three-bedroomed terraced properties. Those properties will be excluded from the scheme. I challenge the Minister to say that those properties present any less a danger to the residents or others in the same block from fire or the other hazards mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not only a question of the properties; also important are the people who manage the properties. Some landlords are good; others, unfortunately, are not. The local authority might tell some Sheffield landlords I know, "You can participate in the registration scheme. We will register your properties and ensure that you do all necessary works to them if you have people in the property, but, if you get rid of one tenant, and so have only four incomes instead of five, you will not be subject to the constraint and control mechanism." Those vandals would go straight for the bolthole. The bad landlords who wish to avoid their responsibilities do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm

Perhaps the Minister can explain why he defends the indefensible. People who are deemed not fit and proper, who would not be allowed to register their property in the registration scheme that allows a local authority to tell a landlord that he is not a fit and proper person to manage a house in multiple occupation, could manage houses occupied by four persons only, whose lives would be at risk because the Government allow this get-out in the Bill. Surely it is indefensible to allow a person deemed not fit and proper under a registration scheme to manage a house with five people to manage a house with four people without any controls whatever because the clause would do away with them. I hope that the Minister will think again about that serious omission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with another category of small houses in multiple occupations which the Government believe should be excluded. The exclusion in the Bill is based on a provision that is already in the Department of the Environment's non-statutory model registration schemes, which local housing authorities do not seek to amend. The four-person threshold is already in section 347(3)(b) of the Housing Act 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What matters is not what proportion of properties are in or out of the scheme but whether we have set a reasonable limit—a sensible threshold—in relation to risk. One can envisage circumstances where 99 per cent. of landlords cause no problem, so we are trying to tackle the problem of a small minority. In practice, a great deal of legislation attempts to stop abuse committed by minorities; but that is the nature of the legislation. The indications are that larger properties entail greater risk, but it does not mean that other properties are left without attention. Registration as such does nothing to improve safety. Work done by landlords to improve fire escapes, for example, improves safety. This work may be done either because of registration or through discretionary action under section 352. If there is a problem, a local authority can act, despite a property's exclusion from registration. Therefore I do not think that the amendment would achieve anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that there is a scintilla of concern among my hon. Friends about what he described as exceptional circumstances, and which might, under certain conditions, become a gaping loophole in the control provisions that he proposes?

	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend invites me to read my own words I must tell him that I would derive only pleasure from that activity. What I believe my hon.

Of course we would wish to do that. I do not believe that a case has so far been made, but if there were evidence to the contrary, I would not exclude our seeking to make adjustments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try to help the Minister out of the dilemma that his hon. Friend has represented? The problem with the current wording of the clause is that it means that properties housing under five people are excluded and that primary legislation would be needed to put them back into any scheme. If the Minister accepted the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich he could, in the model scheme that he approves, exclude those properties and allot them into a scheme only if a local authority can make a particular case for them. That would not need primary legislation. He would keep control of the matter, but would need to accept my hon. Friend's amendment to have discretion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to accept his hon. Friend's amendment.

If there is a genuine problem, I shall seek to take action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that when the clause was drawn up there had been no in-depth research into its effect and that the Government will look at that only when the clause is in operation?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Department of the Environment is undertaking a research project on the identification of factors that contribute to the risk from fire in HMOs. The lessons that we learn from that research will be able to be applied in secondary legislation under the powers of section 365 of the 1985 Act, as amended by clause 70 of the Bill, which we shall deal with later. There is research work into where the risks lie.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the Minister, the Government are waiting for someone to die, be seriously burned or suffer from smoke inhalation from a faultily fitted gas fire before they take my hon. Friend's amendment on board.
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
Earlier we debated hostels in seaside towns, and it was a particularly dreadful tragedy in a hospital in the constituency of the hon. Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) that resulted in the necessary research and the conclusions that the Prime Minister and the hon. Members for Scarborough and for Blackpool, North (Mr. Elletson) are pushing on registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems to ignore the points made by several Opposition Members that in towns and cities where the expansion of university places has taken place, houses that would not normally have been considered for multiple occupation by students are being drafted in. It seems lax of the Government to wait for yet another serious accident when preventive legislation could so easily be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should be a little careful before assuming that legislation is the remedy for all ills. We are introducing the Bill because we recognise a problem that is commonly recognised across the Committee, but there is a division over how the Bill should apply and its extent. In practice, I suspect that that division will turn out to be narrower than it seems in theory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Casualties and accidents will happen irrespective of the tightest legislative framework. We know that. We must make a judgment of where it is sensible to take the Bill. If evidence can be presented that demonstrates that we have made a serious misapprehension of the risks, I shall seek to draw the conclusion that follows. I am note, however, in that position, and I am therefore unable to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put a brief question to the Minister as he aroused my curiosity when he replied to my hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe. The Minister advised the Committee that he was not in a position to accept the amendment. One must ask why the Minister is denied the opportunity to accept a constructive amendment. There must be some reason. Is he not able to accept a reasonable amendment because of some political pressure? There will be a question mark over the value of debates in the Committee if the Minister comes to sittings with a closed mind on such issues because of pressure that has been applied outside. If he is saying that, however reasoned the debate and however reasonable the argument, Ministers are not in a position to accept an amendment, we should have some explanation of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a good try, but it really will not wash. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that we have had an open-minded debate. I hope that the many people who occasionally write articles about how useless Parliament is might take some heart from the constructive exchanges that the Committee has had and, I hope, will continue to have throughout its deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course Ministers come to Committees with certain room for manoeuvre. If it can be demonstrated that there is serious apprehension about real risks, of course I shall be willing to use whatever procedures are open to me to re-examine the issue. At the moment I am not convinced of that, so I have recommended that the amendments be rejected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to the Minister's words and I agree that in our earlier discussions—in the first two weeks of the Committee—we seemed to be making quite good progress, with the Minister accepting that Opposition amendments had merit and were worthy of consideration. I am slightly worried that my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton has hit the nail on the head and that the Minister has been hauled over the coals for making too many concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am reminded of a rather interesting article, to which I have already referred, in 
	<i>Inside Housing.</i> It tells us all sorts of secrets about the Minister. I suspect that there is an element of truth in its observation that the Minister
	<br><blockquote><p>"is ambitious and was said to be 'eating the carpet' after missing out on promotion at the last ministerial reshuffle."</p></blockquote>
Before quoting that, I had a good look round the Room to see whether there were any signs of damage to the carpet—but there clearly were not. The next time I visit the Minister in his office in Marsham street I shall have a closer look at the carpet there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is not the explanation for the rejection of our entirely reasonable amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Attercliffe is right to say that if subsection (2)(b) remains in the Bill as it stands, a local authority will be precluded from registering a property that contains no more than four persons who form more than two households. That is a clear statutory obstacle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to a further review and appraisal, but if after examining the evidence and the research he comes to the conclusion that we believe he will come to, he will be forced to consider further primary legislation rather than being able to operate in a flexible framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will bear in mind the views expressed both by Opposition Members and by some of his hon. Friends, who are experienced in the problems with multi-occupied houses in many parts of the country—and especially in seaside towns—and that, having reflected, he will feel able to introduce at a later stage proposals that will avoid the undue rigidity of the clause as currently framed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Minister has agreed to reflect further and to take heed of the findings of the research that has been commissioned. With that in mind, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 184, in page 34, line 15, leave out "four" and insert "two".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This time I am well prepared. We now come to the third of the exclusions. Subsection (1) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A registration scheme shall not apply to … a house which is occupied by no more than four persons in addition to the person managing or having control of the house and any other member of his household".</p></blockquote>
That is another extraordinarily broad exemption. It will mean that a house in which an owner or the owner's
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
agent has four lodgers cannot be part of a registration scheme. In fact, most two-storey terraced or semidetached houses of the sort to which reference has been made—used for multiple occupancy—will fall foul of that rule. I shall give some examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bristol city council has expressed great concern about the exclusion. It believes that it will allow many people to live in unregistered properties which the local risk-assessment process classifies as high-priority properties for registration. The council said that, within one ward in Bristol, 31 HMOs, out of 63 HMOs with resident landlords, are in its opinion high priority; yet a high proportion of them will be ruled out by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cambridge council found worrying examples of unsafe HMOs with resident landlords, some of which I referred to previously. One of them involves a three-storey property with a resident landlady, four tenants on the first and second floors, but no alarm system. Under the Bill, that property will be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The estimates that we have suggest that, in several areas, approximately 50 per cent. or more of properties currently included in local authority registers will be excluded from the new register. The council for my constituency—Greenwich—is one such authority. I shall read the comments that I received from the principal environmental health officer responsible for dealing with houses in multiple occupation in Greenwich. He wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Rather than strengthening our enforcement powers the provisions set out in the Housing Bill will seriously erode the effectiveness of Greenwich's current registration scheme which has been successfully running since 1991. In fact it is estimated that the current Public Register of 383 HMOs will be reduced by 199."</p></blockquote>
That is a reduction of more than 50 per cent. in the number of HMOs that will be included. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The reason for this reduction is that the Bill significantly narrows the range of HMOs covered by any new registration scheme. Broadly, the proposals will exclude smaller HMOs occupied by less than five people (not counting the person managing or any member of their family) … Whilst the current enabling legislation for registration schemes does not provide authorities with specific enforcement powers in the case of smaller HMOs there is scope for authorities to require landlords of all types of HMO to come forward and notify the authority of their existence. This ensures that authorities can take a more effective approach to enforcement and closely target key areas of their HMO stock according to local priorities."</p></blockquote>
That is a very persuasive case. Earlier, Ministers told us about the importance of listening to local authorities. This local authority has told us not to impose the restrictions because they will limit its powers and ability to take appropriate action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several other authorities will be similarly affected. Croydon estimates that approximately 50 per cent. of HMOs currently eligible for registration will no longer be so. Birmingham—under its first registration scheme—estimates that 85 per cent. of properties currently eligible to be registered will be excluded. Barking and Dagenham estimates that 90 per cent. of its smaller HMOs will be lost. Ealing estimates that 30 per cent. will be lost. That probably reflects the different type of stock in the area. Those figures are stunning and worrying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 218 and 184 would rectify the situation. Amendment No. 218 would simply drop the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0150">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>257</span>
exclusion. That is the clearest, cleanest and most effective response. Given that the Minister will be unlikely to accept that, we thought that we would have a second bite at the cherry and try a more modest approach, which takes the form of amendment No. 184. That would reduce the limitation to houses containing no more than two—rather than four—persons in addition to the person controlling or managing the house. The hon. Members for Scarborough and for Blackpool, North in particular will be familiar with such properties in their constituencies, and I hope that they will see the merit of ensuring that a local authority can register properties containing three or four lodgers as well as the landlord, landlady or agent controlling that property. Amendment No. 184 would allow the register to cover such properties. It would limit the restriction to properties containing two or fewer lodgers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government new clause 7, which we shall discuss later, deals with special control powers. I know that Conservative Members want those powers to apply in seaside areas and elsewhere, but I stress that the powers will be restricted by the Bill. It will not be possible to cover HMOs containing three or four lodgers as well as the owner or managing agent if the Bill is not amended. The measure is too restrictive and it will prevent effective action, so I hope that even if they cannot accept amendment No. 218 the Government will accept amendment No. 184.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should not be trying to hamper local authorities or to prevent them from doing a good job in registering HMOs. They have argued the case for allowing local authorities to get on with the job. If they believe that, they must accept the principles behind the amendments. If they reject the amendments, we shall make it quite clear publicly that what they have said about trusting local authorities and giving them more discretion is humbug, as they will not allow local authorities to do what we all know they should be able to do to deal with HMOs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister, even though he has been chastised for his indulgence to the Opposition earlier in our proceedings, will revert to his normal, emollient personality, and will not feel obliged to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah, but the hon. Gentleman was not listening carefully. The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
It would help if I explained the aims of the provisions. In the discussion on the previous amendment, I said that I would reflect on the appropriateness of the four-person threshold. Therefore, it is logical for me to do the same with the amendment that we are considering. The exclusion for which the clause provides is similar to existing exclusions from control schemes—one household and four other persons. The clause tries to clarify that the first household should be in control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want families to wish to take in lodgers; that is especially appropriate in university towns. We do not want to risk losing such accommodation. We considered the threshold carefully so as not to provide a disincentive for people who wanted to put rooms in their houses to limited use. Houses with resident landlords and a few lodgers are not intrinsically more risky to live in than single household property. We did not simply pluck figures from the air. We based them on the exemption from control provisions in existing legislation, which has not attracted criticisms from local authorities—if necessary, I can provide chapter and verse. When the anchor household is not the manager, the exemption will not apply and the house will be registered under the Scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is too restrictive, but it would be consistent with my previous remarks to agree to examine thresholds. I shall do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Amess</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South (Mr. Brooke). It is a probing amendment, which was inspired by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Universities welcome the possibility of improvements in private rented accommodation that would benefit students. Universities have an excellent reputation as good landlords, and provide high-quality, low-cost accommodation for students. Student residences have been built and maintained by universities with substantial private sector funds. Universities share the Government's anxiety about inadequate fire and safety provisions, and poor amenity standards in some privately owned or rented houses in multiple occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the limited public resources available, the CVCP believes that regulation should be structured to enable and encourage local authorities to target their attention on the worst cases. Any system of regulation should be limited only to HMOs where there are serious
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
problems. Universities believe that purpose-built accommodation that is owned, leased or managed by universities should be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Department of Environment officials have signalled that such exclusions would be tackled in codes of practice, but the CVCP would welcome clarification from my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration and clear assurances about the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Universities can cite a strong body of evidence of their good performance as landlords to support the exclusion of university owned and managed properties. There are 250,000 units of student accommodation, many of which are designed and built to cater for students' needs. Most of that accommodation is not covered by the traditional definition of HMOs. In Scotland, where a separate system for licensing properties operates, it is acknowledged by the Scottish Office that universities should be regarded as responsible landlords. Scottish local authorities may consider exemptions from a licence where there are already adequate standards or property is subject to inspection by a university or college. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to respond positively to the points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South told me that he might not be able to stay to move his amendment, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Mr. Amess) for doing so on his behalf. I have sympathy with my hon. Friend's argument. The exclusion to which he refers was trailed in the Department of the Environment's consultation paper, "Improving Standards in Houses in Multiple Occupation", which was published last July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not write the exemption into the Bill because it does not have general application—it may not be right for all local housing authorities, and some may have justifiable reasons for wanting to register such properties. We intend to deal with the matter in the model registration schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are likely to include other categories of property in the exclusions from the model registration schemes. Those will be houses covered by specific regulatory regimes, such as those provided under the Registered Homes Act 1984, the Children Act 1989 or the Probation Service Act 1933—which covers bail hostels, for example. Another group of possible exemptions is properties owned and managed by other responsible landlords, such as the national health service and registered housing associations. We also mentioned those in our consultation paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reasons for proposing those exemptions from registration is that local housing authorities will know about such properties, and will know whether landlords are generally responsible. If problems occur, the authorities will still be able to use their discretionary powers to enforce standards. It will be open to local authorities to apply to remove such properties from the exemption from registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
When we draft the model schemes, we shall consider carefully the wording about university accommodation with the Department for Education and Employment. I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend the Member for City of London and Westminster, South would tell me his thoughts about the scope of the expression "higher education institution". Should the exemption be restricted to universities, or should institutions such as colleges of further education or teacher training colleges also fall within the net? We will consult on the matter; we are aware of the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now dealing with a further category of properties excluded from the registration scheme: self-contained properties. A large number of self-contained properties are classified as HMOs—in terms of number of residents, it forms the largest of the categories of properties that come under the title of houses in multiple occupation. According to research carried out by Geoffrey Randall published by the Campaign for Bedsit Rights, to which I referred earlier, there are about 250,000 buildings containing more than 1 million units and housing approximately 1.6 million residents in self contained HMOs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Self-containment is no guarantee of a greater or a lower risk, but the majority of self-contained properties are usually in good condition and would not be a high
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
priority for registration. However, some self contained HMOs are a very high risk indeed. HMOs containing self contained flats have been involved in some of the worst incidents of deaths and serious injuries in fires in recent years. Hon. Members will remember especially, with great sadness, the fire in Palmeira avenue, Hove, in April 1992, in which five people were killed in a property consisting of four self contained flats typical of many in that seaside town. The property had no fire precautions and the council had not taken formal action to require them. If such properties are excluded from registration, as they will be under subsection (1)(d), there will be a risk and, sadly, a likelihood, that a similar disaster will occur again, because the authorities will not be required to take steps to ensure that safety precautions are in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The London borough of Croydon reports that one of the few fire deaths in the borough was in a three storey house converted into self contained flats. Although the house was converted to current building regulation standards, the fire precautions were insufficient. That shows, once again, that if that type of house is excluded from the register of HMOs it will not be possible for the local authority to identify a problem and to insist on proper fire precautions being installed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leicester city council, which deals with poorly managed and dangerous HMOs in all excluded categories, has a case involving a house converted into flatlets—one room, en suite bedsits, which are regarded as self contained flats. Since 1986, the owner of the properties has been served with 20 notices under the Housing Act 1985, the enforcement of which has required 70 visits and more than £20,000 worth of works in default. That shows the scale of the problem and the risk to residents living in such properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given examples of properties which the Bill as drafted would exclude from the HMOs registration scheme, and I have one further example. In Nottingham, the council recently chanced upon a house converted into self contained flats on which it had served a closing order on basement rooms many years earlier. When a basement room resident started work for the council, it realised that the landlord was continuing to let the property as an HMO, and had not carried out any improvement work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are simple, straightforward and disturbing examples of the risks in some self contained properties. It would, therefore, be wrong to exclude all self contained properties as a matter of policy. However, it would not be sensible, cost effective or necessary for local authorities to have to register all self contained properties. Amendment No. 210 is a sensible compromise that would allow local authorities to register self contained, rented properties, but not those which were purpose built and owner occupied. The former, like the property in Palmeira avenue in Hove, will in general contain high risk properties, which ought to be included. The latter will in general be indistinguishable from other owner-occupied properties. It is likely that the owner will ensure good conditions and proper safety provisions. In our view, it would therefore not be appropriate to include them in the registration scheme.

The hon. Members for Blackpool, North and for Scarborough are familiar with such problems in their constituencies. Their amendment No. 248 adopts a slightly different approach but with a broadly similar intention. Opposition Members will listen closely to what they have to say about that amendment. They, like us, recognise that the fact of self-containment does not of itself guarantee that a property will be problem-free. The example that I cited of properties in Leicester converted into flatlets is all to clear an illustration. I know from my experience of visiting Scarborough and Blackpool—towns with which I have considerable affinity and which I know well and enjoy visiting—that identical properties converted into self-contained flats for holiday flats or similar uses, can later be used as multi-occupied houses, where all sorts of problems can arise. It would be wrong for such properties to be excluded in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We do not take that lightly. It is right and proper that such people should be safeguarded and that properties, such as the one in Palmeira avenue that I described earlier and which any right-minded Member of the House would think was a disgrace, should not be excluded from a registration scheme from HMOs. We argue merely that such properties should not be excluded from registration. We want the lives of people living in such properties to be given proper regard, and proper safety measures should be taken to protect them. As I said, we shall listen with great interest to the comments of the hon. Members for Blackpool, North and for Scarborough, whose amendment No. 248 seeks to achieve a similar effect. I hope that the Minister will be more accommodating in view of that cross-party communality of interest.

Clause 62 states that the registration scheme shall not apply to houses

Clearly, it is the Government's intention that owner-occupied, self-contained flats or flats that are let out on a long-term lease should be exempted from a registration scheme. We all understand that. After all, we do not want local authority environmental health inspectors snooping round owner-occupied properties.

As the hon. Member for Greenwich said, there is a real problem with self-contained flats. Some of the worst types of HMOs, with the most irresponsible landlords and the most shockingly exploited tenants, are properties comprising self-contained flats. I, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough, have seen that problem in seaside resorts where a large number of holiday flats are often converted into self-contained flats of a much more permanent nature. They have a significant and deleterious effect on the local community and, as the hthere is a real problem with self-contained flats. Some of the worst types of HMOs, with the most irresponsible landlords and the most shockingly exploited tenants, are properties comprising self-contained flats. I, along with my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough, have seen that problem in seaside resorts where a large number of holiday flats are often converted into self-contained flats of a much more permanent nature. They have a significant and deleterious effect on the local community and, as the hon. Member for Greenwich described in sufficient detail, also have an effect on the tenants because of the standard of the conditions in which they are often expected to live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much today about the conditions in which tenants live. I shall say a little about the effect of some self-contained flats on the local community both now and when we discuss Government new clause 7. It is important that my hon. Friend the Minister understands that such properties have just as damaging an effect on the local econony, amenities and the area as do hotels or other forms of hostels. I wish to refer particularly to two areas in my constituency. First, I draw attention to a property in Maitland avenue in Thornton-Cleveleys that had undergone a change of use from being a rest home for the elderly to residential flats. The owner told neighbours that the former rest home was to be converted into four luxury holiday apartments. Not a bit of it—the premises have been converted into a DSS hostel of 11 residential flats. The local community and local hoteliers have had to put up with the same abuse that comes from DSS hostels in the town centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth listing the types of abuse for the benefit of my hon. Friend the Minister. Almost daily, acid house music is played with the windows wide open at full
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
volume until 2 am. Constant shouting and violent abusive language is heard from the occupants both inside the flats and on the street. Several occupants are known to be drug users. Fights have broken out on such premises that have necessitated visits from police and members of the ambulance services during the day and night. I am told that, on occasion, there are as many as six police visits in one day. In broad daylight, a man wielding a carving knife shouting a torrent of abuse, chased another man down the street. Incidents have involved the theft of the radio and petrol from the same car, parking and access difficulties, general problems with noise, bad language, drunken behaviour, vandalism and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same problems arise in Cheltenham road in my constituency. Last year, a constituent complained to me that a double-barrelled shotgun had been fired through her bathroom window. Glass was blasted out and pellets were shot into the bathroom that had just been newly decorated. It could have caused serious injury to her or her husband. Other incidents have involved noise from record players blaring out until 2 o'clock in the morning, rowing and fighting and music booming from the hi-fi played by children of 10 and 11. Last year, one of the tenants was stabbed. The list goes on and on. In terms of the effect on the local community, there is no difference between such self-contained flats and other forms of DSS hostel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim that my amendment, No. 248, or that of the hon. Member for Greenwich, amendment No. 210, is perfect in its wording, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider carefully the thrust of our argument and that, when the Bill returns for Third Reading, he will ensure that the problem is covered by the special control provisions that the Bill will contain when we adopt new clause 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add a tripartisan dimension to the concern that hon. Members have expressed to the Minister? During the 1980s there was a great building boom which, particularly in areas containing large older houses, coincided with demographic changes. Many more households were formed. Many older properties in inner cities—not just in seaside towns—were divided into self-contained flats. That caused considerable problems in areas of high concentration of population. The nature of such areas changed. The hon. Member for Blackpool, North has described graphically to us the problems that can arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the ward that I used to represent in Southampton, we had the same problems, especially with parking. When older properties are converted, there are problems with noise which do not occur in purpose-built properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to know how many properties would be excluded under the provision, according to Department of the Environment figures. What research was conducted on the matter? I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically on the concerns expressed in Committee and that he will reassure us. I recognise that he is unlikely to accept the amendements, although he will probably reject them gracefully again. He has heard the concerns of three different groups on the Committee and I hope that he will return with proposals that meet them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I observe first that if a property is converted into self-contained flats, it requires building regulation approval. If the conversion is recent, the regulations ensure high fire safety standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill excludes from registration schemes HMOs that consist entirely of self-contained flats. The courts have established that a house converted into flats, even if self-contained, may be a house in multiple occupation. We estimate that of the almost 650,000 HMOs in England, more than 350,000 are houses converted into self-contained flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have sought to exclude such properties from registration for two reasons. First, several of the problems in the worst HMOs arise from the sharing of facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms, which, by definition, do not arise in a self-contained property. Secondly, many self-contained flats are owner-occupied on long leases. In such properties, there are fewer management problems than with a transient population in bedsitters or hostels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tenor of the amendments is that it would be reasonable to exclude owner-occupiers from registration. Local housing authorities still have discretionary powers under section 352 and, in some cases, mandatory duties in relation to fire precautions to deal with any problems that come to their attention. The amendments, however, deal with rented self-contained flats. I have some sympathy with that view. The problem is where we drawn the line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, we have excluded all self-contained flats, both owner-occupied and rented. If we adopted the amendments, we would bring into registration the rented flats, but a substantial number of owner-occupied flats would also be brought into the net. For example, in a block of four—or six—self-contained flats, someone living in one of them could be posted abroad by his or her company for a year or two. Naturally, the instinct is to retain the property and to rent it, but the amendment would convert the whole building into an HMO and owner-occupiers still living in their flats could then receive a bill for registration from the local council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, none of us wants that to happen. On this genuinely difficult area of definition, I am willing to see whether we can find an option that brings into the scope of registration those properties in which a closer degree of control by the local housing authority is justified, while leaving the majority of owner-occupiers in self-contained flats the freedom to organise their homes without local authority intervention. I want to consider that option in further detail, because as I said, it is a genuinely complex interpretative area. If my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and the hon. Member for Greenwich will accept the spirit of my offer and withdraw their amendments, I shall see whether we can frame others that will achieve the purpose on which we agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"and in determining the period for which the registration shall apply for particular houses in multiple occupation the local authority shall have regard to any guidance or Code of practice on risks to occupants of such houses approved by the Secretary of State under section 395(A)".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to the length of time during which registration will be effective. The Bill, as drafted, provides that a registration will apply for five years. We believe that that is unsatisfactory because some properties will clearly need to be inspected more frequently and that it is an unduly rigid framework that does not allow local authorities to vary the period of registration, depending on the nature of the property and the degree of risk. We are discussing varied properties, some of which may technically be HMOs which constitute no problem of risk, but others of which are very serious problem properties that may have faults, defects or hazards that are likely to put the lives and well-being of residents at risk. The two sorts of HMOs require different responses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would delete the five-year requirement and subsititue provisions as set out in amendments Nos. 208 and 209, which would give the local authority discretion to decide on the period, which would be no less than one year and no more than four years., depending on the property. That would allow a degree of flexibility. The amendment would also require the local authority to have regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State on the practice to be followed and, in particular, encourage the Secretary of State to give local authority guidance on relevant matters. Local authorities must have regard to the extent of risks to be found in the property when deciding what the registration period should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like all our amendments, our proposal is eminently reasonable; it is entirely in line with the spirit that the Minister called for over the need to allow local authorities flexibility and the freedom to decide how to do things. We propose that, instead of a rigid five-year period, discretion and scope be allowed, but with the Secretary of State giving guidance, and a focus on the crucial issue of risk assessment. That would be a more sensible and pragmatic approach which we hope will produce results in terms of regular visits to high-risk properties, which should be visited frequently, and infrequent re-registration visits to low-risk properties which everyone is satisfied do not put residents at risk. I commend the amendment and hope that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate much of what the hon. Gentleman seeks to achieve with his amendment. It is appropriate to allow an opportunity for the standard of houses in multiple occupation to be checked regularly. Indeed, it is suggested that the proposed system should be capable of generating fee income for local authorities, thereby providing them with resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, re-registration, especially if it is as often as once a year, could easily be unfair to landlords because they would be required to pay fees too frequently and could find the burden onerous. A small number of local authorities might risk using this opportunity to the point of abuse. As well as being a heavy burden for landlords, it might be unfair to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that many of my constituents and people in other seaside resorts will not understand his comment about re-registration being unfair to landlords, given the effect that many of these places have no local communities and what people see landlords do. I hesitate once again to suggest that the hon. Member for Greenwich has a point, but this time he has a very good one. I hope the at my hon. Friend will take his amendment away and consider it carefully before Third Reading, because that five years is far too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise what my hon. Friend is saying, which is right, and in line with what I said to the hon. Member for Greenwich about the need for appropriate arrangements for ensuring that standards are checked regularly. When I speculate about unfairness to landlords I am thinking of genuine landlords who try to abide by the rules and ensure that their HMO is not unsuitable in any way for tenants or the community. The question of unfairness to landlords is valid, as is the question of putting an excessively heavy burden on a local authority with a one year period if an authority then feels that it must inspect each year. I envisage a local authority using the one year period to re-register its most high-risk HMO while still engaged in the basic work of re-registering first HMO. This would cause confusion and lack of clarity in addition to the heavy burden.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am struggling with the idea of a burden on local authorities when the amendments seek to give them the freedom to chose appropriate times for their registration schemes. The Minister expounded that principle most eloquently in his comments about choice for local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take what the hon. Gentleman says and hope that I can reassure both him and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North. I do not think that safeguards are necessary on account of changing the registration period from one to four years. I remind the Committee that local authorities will still have their discretionary powers to inspect HMO during the middle of the term if they have sound cause for believing that standards have fallen. If their inspection confirms their apprehension, they have powers to require works to be carried out. There is no suggestion that nothing will
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
happen between one and five years merely because the Bill proposes a period of five years. Local authorities have discretionary powers, and I hope that they use them. Of course, they can withdraw registration if they so wish. I suggest to members of the Committee—including my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, Morth—that five years is a reasonable period. A period of less than five years could allow unnecessary interference, which could deter landlords from bringing property on to the market. We want property of the right standard to be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Betts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am struggling again with the Minister's logic. If the controls that he says are available to local authorities at any time during the registration period are just as effective as re-registration, why have a five year period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because it is a reasonable period which is relevant to the question of fee income. Fee income works both ways; it provides resources for local authorities, but it provides some measure of burden on landlords which can reduce the availability of housing stock. We cannot ignore the concept of availability of housing stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the period remains at five years, which is a reasonable period. I am most conscious of the apprehensions expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North. From his constituency experience, he knows them better than many other hon. Members. I can reassure him that the discretionary powers that local authorities have will not mean that nothing will happen in the five-year period. I want local authorities to use those discretionary powers where necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am particularly disappointed with the Minister's response. I thought that he would consider two problems. One of the problems with registration is that, if a local authority does not register, it has to rehouse the people involved. As I said on Second Reading, however much one would like local authorities to be dominated by the old medical officers of health that is no longer so. In the 1970s, they would tell local authrorities that in their professional opinion, certain houses were unfit and should be closed. Councils would follow their advice no matter what the inconvenience of doing so. Sadly, those days have gone in too many local authorities. They now try to discover what is expedient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one is happy to rehouse people from a closed dwelling, problems are created. If one is happy to live with circmstances for 12 months within which it is hoped that conditions can be improved substantially and that the local authority can phase in the provision of alternative accommodation, a progression is created in which circumstances that are right on the line can be let go for 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But to let circumstances that are right on the line go for five years, means that the problem that the hon. Member for Blackpool, North described can continue for a very long time. Therefore, there are advantages—for the landlord, the local authority and the people in the accommodation—in allowing people to say "12 months on this one, but the full four and a half or five years on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
most of the others". That would put pressure on the worst of the properties on the borderline, which is of advantage to everyone involved. That would be preferable to someone saying, "We are giving it permission for five years. We are looking a long way into the future, and we cannot expect to see improvements within that period."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concur entirely with the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish. The Under-Secretary's response is not only disappointing but, unsatisfactory. He has not even agreed to reflect on the amendment, as the housing Minister has done previously. There are serious problems. In certain areas, the idea of a five-year gap between registrations is unacceptable. There might be extremely angry residents who think that their interests are neglected if properties are not checked and kept under supervision more frequently. As I said earlier, we want a proper, risk-assessment-based approach, in which local authorities will discriminate between good properties that require infrequent visits and poor properties, or those that contain risks or are badly managed and only scraped through registration on the first attempt. They need to be checked much more frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposals would provide a flexible framework in which the authority could determine the appropriate response, depending on risk and local circumstances. It would give local authorities discretion and accord with the Minister's stated intention to devolve to local authorities more discretion in handling such matters. I cannot understand why he wants to reject this commonsense amendment. I invite the Committee to vote for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: we move to the subject of fees. We encounter another problem because the Bill provides for payments of fees on first registration, and payment of a half fee on subsequent re-registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is similar to that which we have just been debating under the previous group of amendments: the proposal implies a rigid framework in which exactly the same work is involved in all cases. We know that that is not at all the case. The kind of properties that we have heard about in Blackpool and Scarborough, in which serious problems are being caused to neighbours, will require more careful attention, more frequent visits, and therefore more cost to the local authority than houses in multiple occupation that are well run, well managed and in good condition—and the re-registration of which will simply involve a short visit from the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To propose an arbituary half fee when the amount of work differs enormously beggars belief. I cannot understand why Ministers who have spent the entire morning urging us to allow local authorities more flexibility should this afternoon rigidly propose to lay down the exact time scale and fees for re-registration, and not be prepared to allow a degree of flexibility to recognise differing circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments would allow a fee to be charged on original and subsequent registrations. We have provided two options. The first is to to leave the matter there—to leave local authorities the freedom to decide what the fee should be. However, we accept that some Conservative Members may feel that local authorities may abuse that freedom. We have therefore tabled another set of amendments that would require the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
Secretary of State to publish guidelines on the appropriate scale of fees and the circumstances in which no fees should be charged. That would allow a greater degree of Government intervention to guide local authorities, which would be required to have regard to the guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to be an eminently reasonable and sensible framework. We know perfectly well that some HMOs are in poor condition and are potentially dangerous. For example, let us consider an HMO containing 15 rooms that requires close attention and scrutiny by local authority staff. Re-registration of that property will take a great deal more time and effort than that of a good property. As I said, it seems absurd for the scale fees to be fixed in a way that denies the local authority the ability to reflect the amount of work required in different cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have presented two options—we will happily accept guidance from Ministers as to which is preferable. We ask them whether, in accordance with the spirit of what they said this morning, we should give local authorities the maximum degree of discretion to decide how to charge fees, or whether, in a spirit of compromise, we should require the Secretary of State to give guidance and require local authorities to be guided on how to fix fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either way, we are pressing for a more flexible framework that would allow authorities to have regard to the volume of work and the risk involved when setting fees for registration. It is nonsense to pretend that there should be a standard scale of fees covering all eventualities when we know that there is enormous variation in the conditions and risks. Any commonsense observer would say, that there must be variations in the scale of fees to reflect those differences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can find some weight in the hon. Gentleman's argument, although I had difficulty following it from my understanding of the amendments as drafted. From reading of them it seems that they would remove the opportunity for the Secretary of State to set a maximum fee and instead impose a standard fee for both registration and renewal of registration to be specified by the Secretary of State. That is my understanding of how the amendments would work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I say, there is some weight in the hon. Gentleman's argument that different cases could result in different costs, but it would be hard to find a system with such a finely tailored menu that it would be possible to specify a fee, whether it was a standard set by the Secretary of State, as proposed in the amendments, or the maximum specified in the Bill. Such a system would not be possible in a national arrangement. We will prescribe a maximum fee, but authorities will not have to charge it; they can tailor their own fees to the amount of work involved and to the burden imposed on landlords.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenwich wants more HMOs to be included and registration to be more frequent than every five years. He implied that he wanted fees to be higher in some categories. That seems contrary to the new Labour approach, as a greater burden would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
placed on businesses. There is something in the hon. Gentleman's argument, but I prefer the maximum that we propose. We shall consult people about our proposals; at present the amount is £30 per habitable room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Elletson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to intervene, but many of my constituents will feel that £30 is wholly indadequate. We want reasonable fees that reflect the size and scale of the business involved. The Minister spoke of sympathy for landlords, but that will not strike a chord in my constituency, where people have to put up with the disastrous situations created by irresponsible landlords. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter and return with a more acceptable proposal on Report. We did not need to divide the Committee on the previous amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our thought at present is that we will not leave the fee at £30, but perhaps double it to about £60. The figure is not fixed in stone and we shall consult upon it. I take my hon. Friend's point about bad HMOs in his and other seaside constituencies, such as Scarborough. The Bill will give my hon. Friend's local authority real teeth to deal with the basic problem, of which the income from fees is not the most germane part. It is not possible fully to accommodate even the substance of what the hon. Member for Greenwich proposes. Our approach is the right one and our consultations will help to confirm the amount of the fee. I hope that my hon. Friend will think it appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maddock</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am half encouraged that the Minister is going to reconsider the fee. Local authorities have already tried to take action to control bad landlords of HMOs. It is not difficult for local authorities to register property and they may have enough staff to take initial action, but keeping up pressure on landlords year on year to maintain the original conditions to which they hoped they would adhere, is time consuming and costly. I once spent a day in Southampton with the environmental health officer looking at houses in multiple occupation, considering the problems and hearing how difficult and time consuming it was to ensure that the orders and regulations were kept. The Minister should take the opportunity to visit such properties, if he has not already done so, as he would then know what hon. Member's are talking about. Local authorities face great difficulty and considerable cost in keeping up pressure on consistently bad landlords.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not want the Minister to think that the problems so eloquently described by hon. Member's who represent seaside towns are any different from those experienced by local authorities in inner London. What the hon. Member for Christchurch just told the Committee is replicated every day in my constituency when environmental health officers or other local authority officers simply attempt to gain entry to certain houses in multiple occupation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I just finish this point? It is not unknown in my constituency for an owner of a house in multiple occupation who lives in that house and has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V005P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
elderly tenants to lock the door and insist that the tenants should not respond to a general bell, under threat of reprisal. Such allegations are difficult to substantiate but I have little doubt that such things occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take issue with the hon. Lady about whether seaside resorts bear an unfair burden in the running of social security hostels. Is she aware that in the four years to 1994, the national average increase in convictions for shoplifting was 8 per cent., whereas in coastal resorts such as my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North the increase was 47 per cent.? The national average increase in convictions for theft from cars was 9 per cent., but in coastal resorts it was 30 per cent. For trafficking in drugs, the national figure was 71 per cent. and the figure for coastal resorts was 101 per cent. Those are terrible examples of the problems that we face. Coastal resorts have a particular problem, which is why we have been pushing so hard for the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be interested to know whether those figures refer exclusively to people who live permanently in seaside resorts. I wonder what proportion is accounted for by opportunistic crimes by day visitors. The issue of crime is in any case separate from the point that I was making to the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is as difficult, if not more difficult, for my local authority to raise standards in houses of multiple occupation, to defend such rights as the tenants have and to inform them of their rights as it is for local authorities in seaside resorts. I do not have the figures to hand, but I would argue that the greatest housing need tends to be in large urban areas and that London would feature prominently at the top of the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want only to reassure the hon. Lady—I do not want to trespass on her time, or the Whip's time for that matter. The housing benefit figures would show a similar increase over the past four years, which adds to my point. As usual, the devil is in the detail. One has only to look at local conviction figures. For example, the increase in convictions for trafficking in drugs in Eastbourne was about 81 per cent. as against 71 per cent. for the country as a whole—but the increase in Scarborough was 350 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures tell their own story. There are special conditions in seaside resorts and the proposals are intended to reflect that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jackson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still take issue with the hon. Gentleman on the crime figures. There are many other variables. In my constituency the number of convictions for drug trafficking could have been reduced because we lost 22 police officers. There are causes and effects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank you, Mrs. Winterton, for allowing us to stray from the amendments. I reiterate to the Minister that my local authority, which is deeply concerned that standards for tenants in houses in multiple occupation should be raised. The standards in some instances are so appalling that the houses could hardly be regarded as homes and the tenants could hardly be regarded as living in them. Local authorities are vastly overstretched and understaffed. There are many other calls on their time. For example, environmental health officers have a wide remit to cover. I believe that the clause needs to be re-examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raynsford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary will be well aware that we are far from convinced by his response—indeed, his hon. Friends look far from convinced by it. I hope that that is not in any way to do with his murky past, as I see from Roth's 
	<i>Parliamentary Profiles</i>—it would be unreasonable to devote our attentions solely to the Minister for Local Government, Housing and Urban Regeneration—that the Under-Secretary of State for Wales confessed that he had been a child arsonist. That is an interesting revaluation, and I hope that it has nothing to do with the plight of people living in poor-condition properties. I stress that we are concerned about those people. We want effective registration arrangements. We want a scheme that will work. We want local authorities to be given proper discretion to carry forward the arrangements, but the Under-secretary has not given a satisfactory response to our pleas for measures to allow local authorities to do their job more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in the interests of making progress, so that we can consider other amendments first thing during our sitting on Thursday morning, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
