	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Ms Joyce Quin)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will examine the proposed European Union animal by-products regulation. It follows on from an earlier debate on the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy regulation and fits into the framework of other initiatives that are being taken at European Union level, including the proposals on feedstuffs and animal feed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The animal health crisis that is facing the livestock industry underlines the importance of the regulation by highlighting the need for animal material to be disposed of safely. The European Scrutiny Committee's report on the proposed regulation stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Though detailed and highly technical, this is clearly an important piece of legislation, both for its human and animal health and environmental implications".</p></blockquote>
I strongly agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Hayman leads on the matter at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. She has submitted two explanatory memorandums to the European Scrutiny Committee, which I am sure that members of this Committee will have seen in preparation for the debate. Her latest explanatory memorandum informs the European Scrutiny Committee about recent developments and responds to its queries. The fundamental objective of the proposed regulation is to update veterinary legislation on animal by-products to provide high standards of human and animal health protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee has also been given the draft directive that amends Council directives 90/425 and 92/118. That is a simple tidying-up exercise: when the animal by-products regulation is adopted, it will revoke the parts of the old legislation governing trade and imports that will be replaced by the new regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Animal by-products are animal carcases, parts of animal carcases and products of animal origin that are not intended for human consumption. Those categories include animals that die on farms and waste from slaughterhouses and butcher shops. The proposed regulation also covers manure, catering waste and products derived from animal by-products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed regulation results from a review by the European Commission of the existing EU health rules relating to the processing, disposal, trade and import of animal by-products and products derived
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
from animal by-products. It sets out a comprehensive and directly applicable legal framework on the subject. It replaces and simplifies a multitude of existing veterinary directives and decisions that have developed ad hoc over more than a decade, often in response to internal market requirements or crises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed regulation would consolidate and update the provisions of the EC animal waste directive, parts of the so-called Balai directive and associated legislation. The legislation is implemented in Great Britain by the Animal By-Products Order 1999 and the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996. It is proposed that the new regulation will come into force in February 2003. It is a lengthy and highly technical regulation that would introduce a number of changes. The proposed regulation would cover animal by-products—animal carcases, parts of animal carcases and products of animal origin that are not intended for human consumption—but it would also control manure and gut contents and products produced from animal by-products, such as pet foods. It would set conditions for the disposal, processing and use of such material. It would apply controls to trade in such material within the European Union, and to imports from third countries. The presidency has suggested that the scope of the regulation should be extended to include catering waste containing meat or products of animal origin, including that used in pig swill. That extension would ensure that similar types of material were all controlled by the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main change is that the current definition of high-risk and low-risk animal by-products would be replaced by three categories. Category 1 material would be high-risk material for which there would be no permitted uses. It would include the carcases of animals confirmed or suspected of having BSE, specified risk material and ruminant animals that contain specified risk material, including ruminant fallen stock. It would also include the carcases of pet animals. The material would need to be disposed of, without undue delay, by incineration, by rendering followed by incineration or by rendering followed by landfill. Only pet animals could be disposed of directly by burial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Category 2 and 3 material could also be disposed of in that way. Category 2 material would be high risk but, unlike category 1 material, it would have some limited uses. The material would include non-ruminant fallen stock, spoiled meat and carcases of animals with diseases other than BSE and the manure and gut contents of mammalian animals. The material could be rendered and used in a biogas or composting plant. Untreated manure and gut contents could also be used in a biogas or composting plant and fish could be ensiled. Category 3 material is that which is fit for human consumption. It may be rendered and used in feeding stuffs or fertilisers, used in the production of pet food or technical products or treated in a biogas or composting plant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers would still be able to send the carcases of animals that die on the farm to a knacker's yard or hunt kennel. Article 21 of the regulation would also
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
permit member states to use other disposal routes for animal by-products, including using them for scientific purposes, which happens at present, taxidermy and the feeding of wild animals in zoos. The proposed regulation would require the official approval of the premises in which animal by-products are processed. It would set out standards to which they must operate. The regulation would also establish transport conditions and record-keeping requirements. Those requirements would apply both to unprocessed and processed material. For example, raw, part-rendered and fully rendered animal by-products would have to be transported in covered containers and accompanied by a commercial document and, where necessary, a health certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the explanatory memorandum and the supplementary explanatory memorandum submitted by my noble Friend Baroness Hayman. The proposals would, in some respects, bring European Union law into line with that already in place in the United Kingdom. However, in other respects, as my noble Friend pointed out, the controls would go beyond those that already apply in the UK. In particular, the regulation would strengthen controls and provide a complete audit trail from the production to the disposal of animal by-products. There is already a good degree of traceability in the UK. Clearly, such traceability must exist throughout the single market and the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government broadly support the proposals, which are necessary to prevent the introduction or spread of diseases through the disposal or recycling of animal by-products. However, we are also keen to ensure that the controls are proportionate to the risk involved. We shall continue working with our European colleagues to address all the issues with that aim in mind. I look forward to hon. Members' comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->:
	<div class='membercontribution'> We now have until 11.30 for questions to the Minister. I remind hon. Members that their questions should be brief and asked one at a time. There should be ample opportunity for all hon. Members to ask several questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Roe. I will try to be brief, because I have several questions for the Minister. I appreciate her introductory remarks, and I understand that the Government do not necessarily support the entire document. In some of my questions I will ask the Minister to explain why the Government think that certain factors are included in the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that the use of disposal to landfill or burial is permitted for a pet but not for a farm animal in category 1 presents a conundrum to which I cannot find an answer. Burial of category 3 products, which could be used for human consumption, is not permitted. Will the Minister explain why the Commission proposes to allow the burial of pets but not of farm animals, even though pets could be classified in category 1? We know, for example, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
cats can get TSEs—there is clear evidence of that. It is odd that one may legally bury a cat with TSE, but not a farm animal with the same problem. Category 3 deals with edible stuff, which one is not permitted to bury. Will the Minister explain why the Commission has put forward such proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a general response and as an indication of the framework for this debate, it is worth pointing out that the process of introducing this regulation has some way to go before completion. Often we deal in Committee with subjects that are likely to be instantly or shortly concluded in the European Council. In this case, the issues are technical—I do not claim to be an expert on them—and issues may be raised that we can resolve as part of that process. The Council of Ministers has not yet reached a common position, and we are still at the stage of official discussions in the various committees and Council working groups. The proposals must then be sent to the European Parliament, where they will be examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I last appeared before the Committee, we discussed some of the Commission's proposals relating to making the temporary feed ban permanent. My guesstimate is that the decision-making process for the regulation is likely to go hand in hand with discussions about whether to make that ban permanent. Conclusions may be reached on that in May, June or July.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about pets and the issue of burial. Three disposal routes are available for people with a dead pet: burial, cremation and rendering before landfill or incineration of the rendered material. Therefore, burial is not the only possible route for disposal of pets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pets are included in category 1, the highest risk category, because in some other member states pets have been rendered and the resulting meat and bonemeal fed to livestock. The proposal would stop that happening in future by requiring that material resulting from rendered pets could not be used for any purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the possibility of a cat with TSE being buried. Obviously, if people were worried that the cat's death was related to a TSE, the cat could be disposed of by one of the other routes. The hon. Gentleman makes a useful point to discuss with the European Commission. He asked why it was possible to permit the burial of pets but not animals for human consumption. We have pointed out to the European Commission that a complete ban on burial for farm animals would probably not be practical, and the latest text of the proposed regulation includes scope for burial of category 1 material in remote areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue was raised during a previous Committee sitting in which we considered the TSE regulation. The difficulty of disposing of an animal in remote areas might result in an exception to the regulation. We do not know how the Commission will draft the final definition of a remote area, but it is likely to include remote islands, for example, and remote areas in which population density is low and the disposal facility is situated a long way away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ian Gibson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norwich, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would be the consequences of the EU accepting the standards and the United Kingdom not doing so? What would be the consequences of a different standard for the food chain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be unsatisfactory for several reasons. We face common problems in the EU. In the light of recent anxieties about bovine spongiform encephalopathy in many EU countries there is certainly a feeling that a European approach is necessary to tackle that common problem. In addition, if some countries perceived other countries to have less stringent regulations, they could use that to create barriers to trade or might feel that they had to erect barriers to trade simply to allay public anxiety. Given the history of BSE in Britain, it is politically appropriate for us to seem to be working in partnership with our colleagues and not following a separate route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous sitting of the Committee, a similar issue was raised about differences between different countries' experience. The European Commission and the EU have a responsibility to recognise that, in dealing with BSE, countries face different circumstances. In our case, the controls that we have in place seem to have started to tackle the problem effectively. We are not the same as a country that is starting to put such controls in place. For example, SRM controls and, especially, the over-30-months rule are a feature of the British system, and we are obviously a long way further down the track in making that system work. We must take into account different countries' circumstances while providing a framework for a proper approach, close and continuing dialogue and the sharing of research experience and other information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Peter Brand 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Isle of Wight)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, recent history has revealed the need for regulations to protect livestock, indeed, all animals—and humans, in cases involving food. What has been done to evaluate the effectiveness of the various routes of disposal set out in the regulations? Clearly, rendering is one process. Pressure cooking seems to be the favourite solution in the regulations, as opposed to composting or landfill. Where is the scientific evidence of reduction of risk following those processes? Composting may be more effective than rendering something sterile or using landfill, in which it is more difficult for something to degrade. I welcome the Government's view reported in paragraph 2.11 of the report of the European Scrutiny Committee that there should be a sound scientific basis for the regulations, and I would like to be reassured that that will be so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point that is linked with the answer that I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson), in terms of proceeding according to the best scientific advice and via a route that involves sharing knowledge across the European Union. We have our own advisory and scientific committees in the United Kingdom, including the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, which plays an important role,
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
as well the Standing Veterinary Committee, and, at European Union level, the scientific steering committee, which advises on all aspects of the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is also right to flag up the fact that we may receive different advice about the extent of risks. He mentioned composting. Under the Animal By-Products Order 1999, composting is illegal in the United Kingdom. There is some debate between European experts as to the standards proposed for composting and biogas plants, and whether they can kill spores in spore-forming organisms. We must ensure that the standards are capable of destroying harmful organisms such as anthrax and botulism. There is debate about that because it is not an exact science. We need to proceed cautiously in the framework of this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lawrie Quinn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough and Whitby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take my right hon. Friend the Minister back to her earlier answer to the question from the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice), regarding remote areas. I am sure that my right hon. Friend realises that Scarborough and Whitby could be categorised as a sparsely populated area. She will recall meeting some of my local farmers' groups last summer, when farmers pointed out the current burden on their businesses. In the context of this directive, the proposed framework on waste and the soon-to-be introduced European food standards agency, has my right hon. Friend or any of her Departmental colleagues made an assessment of the likely additional burden on farmers who are already hard pressed in areas such as mine? Does she believe that the European Union will look closely at extra financial support to ensure that the much-needed measures are put in place as soon as possible?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's question is important. Certain assessments have been made in the information provided to the Committee by my noble friend Baroness Hayman. It is fair to say that different parts of the industries affected have expressed less concern about this regulation than about feed ban issues, which were aired by the Committee, at least in part, when I last appeared in front of it. However, there are some uncertainties. For example, hunt kennels offer a valued service. A cost has been calculated in the Burns report and elsewhere in respect of the loss of that service. However, that depends on other aspects, too. The European Commission is undertaking a study into the funding arrangements for the various disposal routes to which the regulation refers. We hope that it will be concluded shortly. We are pressing the Commission to look at the systems that operate in different countries, with the worthy aim of ensuring that costs in different countries are taken into account when the regulation is in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as considering the overall effects on our country, we must look at some of the regional variations. When I answered a question in the House recently about the fallen stock service, it was clear that farmers in some areas benefit more from that service than farmers in other areas, according to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
geographical distribution of hunts and what facilities are available. The Commission's study would fit in well with the work that the Government must do to ensure that our system is accessible to those who need to use it for safety as well as economic reasons. There must not be huge competitive differences throughout the European Union when implementing the regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Christopher Gill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ludlow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister for not being in Committee for the first two or three minutes of her opening speech. I intended her no discourtesy. I declare an interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister would be the first to agree that livestock farmers are worried about how they will be able to dispose of fallen stock in the future, given that hunting is likely to be banned and kennels will no longer be available to offer the free service that has been invaluable to livestock farmers, such as mine, in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seventh report of the European Scrutiny Committee states at paragraph 3.14 that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the original proposal would have banned the use of burial to dispose of ruminant animals which die on farm",</p></blockquote>
although the paragraph later states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the revised text now permits the burial of fallen stock in remote areas."</p></blockquote>
We need a clear assurance from the Minister about what will happen if hunt kennels are closed down, because the alternative for a farmer in those circumstances will be disposal by rendering. The minimum that renderers want to charge is about £90 per tonne. An average fat beast weighs about half a tonne, so it will cost about £45 to have the animal carted away for destruction. That is a serious oncost to farmers who are not making any money at the moment. We must have a categorical assurance from the Minister that on-farm burial will be allowed throughout the country, not just in remote areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman such a categorical assurance, although we shall work with the Commission to achieve sensible arrangements for remote areas. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Quinn) referred to that. I would encourage hon. Members who are worried about the matter to submit their ideas to us in the context of the negotiation in which we are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Gill), given the problems experienced by the farming and agricultural community. However, the regulation is not due to come into effect until February 2003. Although the hon. Gentleman predicted an early conclusion to our deliberations about hunting, no one is in any doubt, whatever his views, that the issue is controversial and must yet go through some lengthy parliamentary procedure. Therefore, there will be time to discuss with the industry how to deal with the fallen stock service in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I am not minimising fanners' worries about that matter, but we have an opportunity to discuss the best arrangements with the industry and how they may be best delivered throughout the country. Farmers with fallen stock will have the option of the rendering service, but they will also have the service of knacker's yards, in the circumstances outlined in the regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my right hon. Friend the Minister say a few words about the consequences of the Phillips report, which identifies the problems of knacker's yards and the feeding of SRM material to hounds in kennels? She will know that abuses and prosecutions have occurred in Somerset; will she say something about the extent of that abuse and the additional measures that we should introduce in the next few years until hunting with dogs is prevented by law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Improvements have been made since the period described under the Phillips report, as a result of the report and of the greater awareness of the importance of disposing of carcases safely. Unannounced regular inspections of hunt kennels are now made and the number of problems has reduced sharply, but the kennels are not subject to the day-to-day inspection system undertaken by the Meat Hygiene Service in abattoirs and slaughterhouses. The differences in supervision could not be altered without the constant presence of a veterinary or Meat Hygiene Service person at hunt kennels, which would be an ambitious project. The Government take the issue seriously because of the recommendations and findings contained in the Phillips report.

The hon. Member for Ludlow referred to farmers who already pay for the disposal of fallen stock.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Roe. I will endeavour to be brief.

I want to take the Minister back to the question of science raised by the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Dr. Brand). Disposal serves two purposes: to get rid of the material and to increase safety for humans and animals. What scientific evidence exists about the impact on the pathogens—whether anthrax or botulism, which the Minister described, swine fever, foot and mouth or one of the many others—of burial, pressure cooking to the standards proposed, burial in lime pits and rendering? How effectively are the pathogens destroyed by the various disposal methods listed in the regulation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of these questions are technical and difficult to answer speedily. As I tried to explain in my answer to the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, different experts assess the effectiveness of the various disposal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
routes differently. In terms of composting, we remain to be convinced that the organisms are effectively destroyed. The pressure cooking route seems to be effective, depending on the category of material in question. There are no differences between the European Commission and us on that aspect. Apart from on composting and biogas, we are in broad agreement with our European colleagues,. I am aware that that is a short answer to a question that has many different ramifications. It can be answered more sensibly at greater length or in writing to Committee members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have in mind some of my local farmers. I am especially concerned about some aspects of enforcement of the regulation. Has the Minister been able to discuss with colleagues from European partner countries establishing a level playing field throughout the European Union? That would ensure that enforcement is carried out on a standardised cross-border basis. As a result, our farmers in particular will not have to endure some of the things that they feel that they endure at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a sound point, which always guides our approach to such regulations. A genuinely uniform pattern needs to be created across the European Union, under which producers and industries in different countries are not unfairly disadvantaged. At the same time, the negotiations are quite tricky because, clearly, no one wants to err on the side of risk. Given the history of BSE in the UK and the difficulties that it has caused for our partner countries as well, it behoves us to be in the forefront of taking sound, science-based and, as far as possible, risk-free measures. That is our approach. We analyse closely with the farming industry the effects of such proposals and regular consultations are held. My noble Friend Baroness Hayman has provided information to the European Scrutiny Committee and this Committee about the consultations and reactions of the industry. My hon. Friend's point is especially relevant in terms of the feed ban. We will have to work closely with the industry on the proposals to make that ban permanent from July.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to return to the problem of fallen stock and the derogation of being able to bury such stock in isolated and remote communities. As a Member who represents an island, which could be regarded as remote and isolated, I would not like the derogation to be used as an excuse for not having a proper disposal mechanism. If we are to use such a derogation, it should be scientifically justifiable in terms of public and animal health. Will the Minister give an assurance that, when she reviews the fallen stock arrangements, the operation of the knackering industry and the use of incinerators, she will also look into the maintenance of small abattoirs and making small abattoir facilities available to remote communities? That would allow sound stock to enter the food chain, replacing the ridiculous situation of creating risk material.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have visited the Isle of Wight and I have never thought of it as remote, but as accessible to visitors such as me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a fair point about remote places. However, the Commission is looking into the matter in a restrictive rather than a liberal manner—if I may say that to him. I can see the Commission's point of view. Islands that do not have a collection centre, processing plant or incinerator are in a different situation to islands such as the hon. Gentleman's constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of hon. Members have asked about implementation. The Commission visits member states regularly to check that legislation has been effectively implemented. It also works with national enforcement authorities to find out how implementation has been carried out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Rudi Vis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley and Golders Green)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the answers that my right hon. Friend gave about remote, isolated places and the level playing field. I am from the Netherlands, which is such an overpopulated and poxy little country that no places are remote. Therefore, it will always be difficult to achieve a level playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend was going to talk about the remoteness of his constituency. I would have found it challenging to respond to that. When we examine the level playing field, we must look at all aspects of the regulation. Obviously, the remoteness criterion is one aspect, and a fairly small part of the overall regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give an undertaking to investigate the methods of disposal in all other EU countries? If it transpires that other countries have a national incineration service, will she undertake to consider that as part of the UK's response to deal with this problem in the future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know from experience that the hon. Gentleman likes to ask me to give assurances, and sometimes even categorical assurances. It would not be up to the UK to undertake such work. As I mentioned, the European Commission is investigating funding arrangements for disposal in all member states and we await the results of that study. However, my impressions so far are that some countries have a national service while others do not. Some countries have a mixture of routes while others have a levy system that helps to fund the service. Some countries have other financial arrangements. Therefore, I know enough to state that the pattern varies throughout the EU.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the amendment that, I think, was tabled by the official Opposition to the Hunting Bill, about a national service. The difficulty with that amendment was that it seemed to imply a nationalised service. However, we are trying to ensure that a genuinely accessible and safe service is available to producers throughout the country. We still want to discuss the organisation and funding of such a service with the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister discussed with her ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health who are responsible for food standards in the UK whether we should draw on our recent experiences to offer advice to the people who are responsible for setting up the European food standards agency, so that the regulation, and others like it, can be introduced in the manner that all members of the Committee would like?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there have been discussions and contacts on those matter both at official and ministerial level. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food believes that it is important to work closely with the Department of Health because the Food Standards Agency reports to that Department, and also because there is often overlap, especially on animal health and human health issues, between the work that is done in the EU Health Council and in the Agriculture Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are communicating their experiences of the FSA to the European Commission so as to inform the debate on the setting up of the European food authority. We believe that it is crucial for that authority to be able to link in satisfactorily with national food authorities. If the system is not co-ordinated effectively, conflicts can arise due to lack of communication and misunderstanding. That would be particularly negative given the current public concern about food safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn the Minister's attention to the issue of catering waste, which is addressed in the proposed regulation. Will she explain the definition of catering waste? The proposal refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"catering waste intended for the production of swill",</p></blockquote>
but I cannot find a definition of catering waste. Is domestic kitchen waste included in the definition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the processing of swill, the explanatory memorandum mentions that the proposed standards for pressure cooking are higher than those that are currently required in the UK. Therefore, the Minister will not be surprised that I raise the topical issue of foot and mouth. Although I do not wish to prejudge the conclusions about its origin, it seems likely that it has been caused by swill, and more particularly by the addition of a material to swill that should not have been added. Are the Government satisfied that the UK standards and the proposed standards in the regulation for the treatment of swill are adequate to ensure the destruction of all pathogens that may be present in catering waste, including those that might be present in a product that is fit for human consumption but not for animal consumption, as is the case in foot and mouth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a number of important points. As he is a former pig farmer, I wish that I had the opportunity to ask him what he feels about pig swill and its use 
	<i>[Interruption.]</i> He says that he never used it, so he is typical of pig farmers because I understand that only about 1.5 per cent. or 1.6 per cent. of them use swill. It must be kept in mind that safety changes to swill regulations would not affect a huge proportion of the UK pig industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Catering waste is defined in article 2, paragraph 45 of the amended text as
	<br><blockquote><p>"waste food intended for human consumption from kitchens, restaurants, catering facilities, the household of the farmer or persons attending susceptible animals; and foodstuffs of animal origin, or foodstuffs containing products of animal origin, which were originally intended for human consumption but are destined for animal consumption for commercial reasons".</p></blockquote>
The Government feel that it is important to keep a clear dividing line between catering waste and animal by-products; we understand why they are included in the regulations, but a separation is important for a number of practical reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman tempted me to go down the topical path of considering the possible source of the foot and mouth disease outbreak. Investigations into that outbreak are continuing. The animal by-products regulations propose a higher temperature control than we currently have, but the current controls, if properly implemented, do not pose a risk of foot and mouth disease. We will continue to discuss the matter with the European Commission. Although we are happy that our existing standards kill off foot and mouth organisms effectively, we are not averse to tightening standards on pig swill, given the small number of pig farmers that use it, and despite the fact that the proposals may necessitate those farmers procuring new cookers. Such a move would respond to public concern and the feelings of many pig farmers and producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In her opening remarks, the Minister said that the regulations would not come into effect until February 2003. Does she not think that that should be postponed until the European Union has decided on the method of disposal for the future, and how people will be recompensed if it is thought that some financial arrangement should be made to deal with the vexed question of fallen stock?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The time scale allows us to address the issues fully, as I said earlier. Consideration of this matter should not be postponed unnecessarily, because the regulations streamline and simplify many existing controls. Given the fact that the European Union is considering the feed ban and the TSE regulations, it makes sense for us to consider those matters in tandem. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will press the Commission for its study into the disposal of fallen stock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I turn the Minister's attention to the impact assessment of the proposals and, in particular, the costs issues? I was surprised that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food estimated the cost of on-farm burial at £50 to £80. Will the Minister explain the basis for that assessment, which most farmers find surprising? I ask that because, if the estimate is to be used as a comparator with the cost of other methods such as the knacker's yard or rendering, we must ensure that the figures are accurate. My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow gave some figures earlier that suggested that those for burial were of the same magnitude as those for other means of disposal. I would be surprised if that were the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The cost of installing pressure cookers would be a significant cost for anyone who wanted to continue swill feeding. Does the Minister believe that that could herald the death knell of swill feeding as a system?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is too soon to tell what the finalised regulation will have to say about the matter of pig swill. If I had to make a guess, although the Commission has proposed a higher standard for temperatures produced by new pressure cookers, given the balance of opinion among member states, the new standards could be based on current UK standards. I may be slightly contradicting what I said earlier in describing the Commission's view. In terms of the overall balance of opinion among member states, however, our present standards are broadly acceptable. It is too soon to predict the actual standards on swill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire broadened the debate by asking whether swill had a future as a general system. The debate on that is gathering momentum for obvious reasons, but it does not affect the regulations that we are considering. I am unsure whether more pressure will be applied in later stages of the debate over the regulations. I would welcome hearing hon. Members' views on the subject. As for on-farm burial, the hon. Gentleman referred to part of the explanatory memorandum that deals with the cost of alternatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to the previous occasion on which the Scrutiny Committee met? We expressed concern about proposals for fish by-products and how they might affect the fishing industry, which is already hard pressed. Has the Minister examined the issue further? If so, will she tell the Committee what she found? Will the Government press for derogation for fish by-products?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We intend to press for derogation on the basis of our scientific advice. I am aware of my hon. Friend's interest and that of the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith), who raised the matter at a previous sitting. We have not changed our minds. We understand the concern, but it relates less to the safety of fish meal than the possibility of cross-contamination. In view of overall controls and provisions for separate treatment of these problems, we believe that it is possible and desirable to exclude fish meal from the permanent feed-ban proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When implemented, the proposals will add to the bureaucratic and cost burdens of the industry. Will the Minister tell us whether imports into the European Union from other parts of the world comply with the criteria in the EU proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission envisages that similar provisions will have to apply to imports. It already inspects and receives reports about control systems in other countries. It would continue to do so to ensure that trade, jobs and livelihoods in the European Union are not undercut by lower standards elsewhere. We can do so when considerations of human and animal health are relevant. It is more difficult to take action
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
against imports in respect of different methods of production that do not pose a risk to human or animal health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission is likely to remain vigilant about the issues raised by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire in respect of the current outbreak of foot and mouth disease. We are all conscious of the importance of controls of suspect imported material; it is certainly exercising our colleagues in the European Union and we shall try to ensure the best controls possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Ms Quin.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>11.29 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee, as we have already covered much of the ground. The Minister said that there was a long way to go in discussions on the proposals; she mentioned May, June or July, and by then she and I may have changed places and there will be different issues to consider. The Minister may wish to refer to what I say now in a few months' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In her introductory remarks, the Minister referred to the simplification of the proposals. It may be a simplification in European terms, but it is a tremendously complicated issue. I understand that this is not the right hon. Lady's usual field of operation and that she may not have all the answers to hand, but some of what she said is not acceptable—most importantly on the issue of scientific evidence. Any discussion of the regulations must be based on what scientific evidence is available and how it is replicated in the proposals. As I said, we are worried about the pathogens or organisms, including transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, about which so little is known, and the impact of various disposal systems upon them. I refer especially to TSEs because they are the most serious, although foot and mouth, classical swine fever and others are also serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If burial is not a satisfactory disposal for an animal that has died of a TSE because the path of the TSE prion, or whatever the organism is, can survive burial—I understand that that is why we do not bury cattle that have died of BSE—why should it be permissible to bury a cat that has died of TSE? In reply to my question, the Minister said, "Well there are other disposal routes for category 1", which is true, but it is not compulsory to use them. According to the definition of category 1, someone could bury a cat that had died of TSE. If people have to adopt another disposal route, that is fine, but it is not acceptable to bury an animal that has died of TSE when, for understandable reasons, we do not bury cattle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have seen the figures for TSE in cats and no case has been discovered for some years. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that if there were a higher incidence we would quickly have to ensure that another disposal route was taken. The lack of cases of TSE in cats and the fact that strict feed controls are in place will prevent the problem that the hon. Gentleman describes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sincerely hope that it will. It is possible that the reason why TSE in cats has disappeared for the time being is that other BSE controls stop specified risk material from going into pet foods. We shall never know for certain whether that is the reason, but it is a probability. However, the simple fact remains that we need to know whether the different diseases are destroyed by burial. If they are not and there is a risk of that organism emerging by leaching, for example, to potentially reinfect either humans or animals, burial should be banned regardless of whether it is in respect of a pet or a farm animal. I do not understand the distinction. I am not advocating such action. In principle, I am in favour in farmers of being able to bury whatever they want as it is by far the cheapest option, but I am also worried about the animal and the human health implications. If the science says that burial is not a satisfactory way in which to dispose of an animal that died of a particular disease, burial should be banned in respect of all animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Gibson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that BSE and the prion are an absolute problem? No one has find a way to inactivate the protein, whereas there are well-known methods such as heat or chemicals to get rid of viruses and bacteria. Prion is a real problem. It has not been seen in cats because cats probably do not live as long as the incubation period of the prion. It takes a long time for the effects of the prion to manifest, so the cats die of some other illness. There is no diagnostic test for BSE yet. BSE is an anomaly. It is different, and to accentuate the problem of getting rid of bacteria and viruses is probably wrong. BSE must be handled separately from other organisms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman's scientific knowledge vastly exceeds mine. I would not dispute the fact that TSE and the prion seem to be a unique phenomenon. I am not sure whether I agree with his conclusions about cats because they live longer than cattle. Most cattle are killed for various reasons before they are 10-years-old, whereas most cats will live well into their teens if not into their 20s. I am not sure that I share his conclusions about the incubation period, but it is an issue about which so little is known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even with viruses, bacteria and anthrax, we do not have—at least in the Committee—the scientific information on which to conclude whether the different forms of disposal are appropriate. I come back to my fundamental point about consistency. If it is acceptable to bury a pet animal that has died of a certain disease, why is it not acceptable to bury a farm animal? That is the fundamental inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I shall move on beyond that aspect of burial because I want to touch on the issue of remote areas to which some hon. Members have referred. I strongly hope that the Minister will seek a wider derogation than islands. Although the Isle of Wight is an obvious exception, islands are generally remote areas. However, being an island is not a necessary factor is becoming a remote area, especially in parts of the north of England. I have visited remote farms in the constituency of the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby and there is an even greater number of them in Scotland. There must be as much exemption as possible for remote areas, as long as it is consistent with the fundamental point of safety and of whether burial is a safe disposal for whatever organism it is that has caused the death of a particular animal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow and others have referred to the major issue of fallen stock. I understand the Minister's attitude that we have plenty of time to think about such matters before a hunting ban come into effect. Farmers throughout the country are worried about how fallen stock will be disposed of if that happens, a matter that was supported by all MAFF Ministers. Incidentally, I am not as pessimistic as my hon. Friend about the likelihood of such a ban, but should a hunting ban materialise, what means of disposal would be used for fallen stock if burying them on the farm is not allowed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point about swill. The Minister is correct that only a tiny number of farmers feed swill to pigs. The number used to be much higher, but regulations under various Governments have considerably tightened the requirements in relation to heat treatment of swill for feeding. However, it appears—I shall say no more than that—that the current foot and mouth outbreak was caused by a breakdown in that control system. On the one hand, we must consider whether pressure cooking treatment can be effectively controlled and policed to allow swill feeders to continue, while, on the other, we must consider whether swill feeders can accept the cost implications. Clearly, I do not want any farmer driven out of business. However, like everything else, farming practice must be guided by scientific evidence. If the European Commission's proposals for pressure cooking criteria are necessary, the costs to be borne by swill feeders will be immense. I suspect that many of them will decide that they are not prepared to make such an investment. If, as the Minister suggested, the general opinion of member states is that the UK standards are adequate, that will relieve swill feeders of what would be a significant investment. I am sure that swill feeders will be anxious to know the answer to that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, I welcome simplification, the bringing into line of European and British regulations on disposal of animal by-products and the health implications. However, this morning's debate has lacked the science that is necessary to inform our consideration of the measures. I hope that the Minister will convince me that that science is available to her or her right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who will carry out the negotiations in Europe until 3 May, and that it will be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
available to whoever follows them. The foundation of these proposals is in science, and, following that, in the practicalities of the disposal methods that are being advocated and that would be permitted. I reiterate my belief that there is an inconsistency in the proposals that needs to be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.42 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All Committee members agree that regulations are needed to protect not only the livestock and other animals, but the people who consume farmers' produce. However, this morning's discussions have shown that there is a lack of understanding or knowledge about how to meet the Government's requirements in relation to controlling animal by-products with a sound scientific basis that is proportionate to the risk that they are designed to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations under discussion are helpful in creating three categories of risk material, although, within those categories, there are inconsistencies. The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire is right about the issue of pets and fallen stock. Why can they be buried sometimes, but not at other times? There seems to be no scientific logic behind that. I am also worried that the regulations seem to concentrate on heat treatment and destruction rather than biological methods of rendering infections innocuous. If we follow the route indicated in the regulations, we shall add to the centralisation of solving local problems. If we have to rely on vast rendering plants even more than we do now and on massive investment in pressure-cookery arrangements, it will be extremely difficult for the industry to cope with that without creating an infrastructure that, if anything, will increase the risk of cross-contamination, as we have found in the present crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider European solutions suggested not only by the Dutch Government—who, as the hon. Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Dr. Vis), in his isolation, pointed out, do not have to deal with great distances and are centralised in coping with rendering problems—but will liaise with people in more peripheral areas of Europe to find out whether the recommendations are practical and will deliver our objective, which is increased public safety. I am worried about what has happened to the abattoir industry, for example. The loss of our local abattoirs over some 15 years ago has created a genuine animal welfare and risk problem. Animals must travel either to the west country or way into the south-east, to Guildford, and that is unacceptable on animal welfare grounds. That is one of the consequences of imposing regulations centrally without thinking through the consequences. Reading the regulations, I had a sense that the proposal is a bureaucratic solution with brass knobs on, rather than a practical solution that considers what needs to done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that we should not use the precautionary principle. In the event of uncertainty, we must take what seems to be the safest approach according to our present knowledge. The hon. Member for Norwich, North is right to say that BSE

presents a particular problem. However, I believe that enough time remains for some pure research on prions, botulism and anthrax. Much work has already been done. When something becomes landfill, it is actively decomposed through composting, has biological accelerators or lime added to it or is boiled, rendered or incinerated. We do not have enough information available to us at the moment to make a proper judgment. I hope that in time the Minister will be able to place in the Library the evidence on which she and her Department will base negotiations with our European colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been useful, because it has raised several issues that need to be considered. Only one other issue is vital for producers. We need certainty soon. We cannot afford to spend two or three years on a policy on fallen stock and capital investment for incinerators and on how it will be funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unrealistic to expect the fanning or fishing industries to carry an additional burden beyond what they are already suffering. A way must be found of reassuring people who, through animal husbandry, not only produce our food, but also maintain our countryside. We should not forget that grazing is an essential part of maintaining the British countryside and that there is a genuine need to give our farmers an assurance that the Government recognise that, however desirable extra regulations and means of controlling what happens in the countryside are, they cannot be introduced without cost. The Government should recognise that at the moment, in our current structure, that cost cannot be borne by farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the hon. Member for Isle of Wight, especially on the question of cost. There is no doubt that the agriculture industry, and the livestock industry in particular, simply cannot bear any additional cost. That was the purpose of my question to the Minister about the disposal of fallen stock. In fairness, in opening the debate the Minister said that she was keen to ensure that controls are proportionate to the risks involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is always a danger on these occasions that we will get carried away by the emotion of the case rather than any strict analysis of the evidence that may or may not be available. We are proceeding on the basis of an assertion in the explanatory memorandum that the Commission considers that the proposals are necessary to retain public confidence. That is merely an expression of opinion. We must persuade our Ministers and Departments to come to the Committee and say, "There has been a breakdown in animal or human health for which we must take steps".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would go further. Far from putting more regulation on the statute book, which is why we are here this morning, the biggest problem is that the existing regulations are not being enforced. If anyone doubts that, they need only to read the newspapers to see how beef from Germany has been imported with the spinal cord intact. That is against the existing law.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Our priority should be to ensure that the existing law is enforced before we rush to make new regulations that add to bureaucracy and the cost to the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not that an unfair point? Is not the law being enforced in respect of the German case? Our meat inspectors are enforcing the law, and that case demonstrates the effectiveness of the Government's enforcement process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point. The regulations were not in force in the exporting country. They were clearly breached in Germany; otherwise their beef could not have arrived in the United Kingdom with spinal cord in the carcases. In this debate we are talking in the context of the European Union. I am not a great lover of the EU. I wish we were not in the EU, but in the context we must look at the issues in the round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not interesting that the EU is considering banning exports from Germany, while the United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency seems diffident about banning imports from Germany?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I have a great deal of sympathy with that view. Many of my farmers will be posing the same question, and it is one to which the Government should give more concentration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the easiest things for Government to do is to go round saying, "We are going to ban this, that and the other." Last week in the House we were discussing the ban on hunting with dogs, the consequence of which would be that kennels would close and that outlet for fallen stock would disappear. The regulations propose the banning of on-farm burial except in remote areas. If my memory serves me correctly, not so long ago the EU wanted to close our knacker yards because they are, apparently, unique to the United Kingdom. We do not fit the European prescription, so the EU wants to get rid of them. Almost at a stroke, three outlets for fallen stock will be done away with. That is the easy part. Any Government can ban things. Before banning this, that and the next thing, this Government—and I share the hopes and aspirations of my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire that in a few weeks' time it will be his problem to resolve—must determine how we will make provision in the future. It is not responsible government to ban something without having anything to put in its place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Home Office Minister got very cross with me in the House last week when I asked him whether he had a single reason why he could not answer the question about fallen stock in the context of kennels. He could not tell me and got very cross about it—unjustifiably, because the question was appropriate and legitimate. I pose the same question to the Minister today. Is it really justifiable to introduce more regulations, costs and bureaucracy without addressing the fundamental problem? The Minister should come to the House in
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
the near future and say, "We have listened to what hon. Members have said and we propose to do so and so."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister will tell us that the matter is in the melting pot, that the European Union is considering it and that we will receive an answer in due course. I hesitate to ask for a categorical assurance because she has scolded me once for that. I appreciate how powerless our Ministers are in the context of the European Union, so it is unfair of me to ask for such assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our Ministers are neutered by dint of our membership of the European Union and can do nothing without the agreement of the other European Union Ministers. People such as myself can huff and puff but we cannot force the Minister to make a decision, because she does not have the power to do so. That is one of the absurdities of these Committees. We can pontificate about regulations and say what we like and do not like, but we cannot amend or reject them. They will go through because they are European directives and, under the rules of the European Union, we are obliged to translate them into domestic legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.56 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First I will respond to some of the points made by the hon. Member for Ludlow. We are not proposing more regulation. Indeed, in introducing the document, I mentioned the fact that some of the existing legislation will be streamlined into the new legislation. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman did not mean to imply that we should not update legislation in the light of changing circumstances or evolving scientific information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Government update legislation in the European Union context, we consider it an opportunity to streamline and simplify. In the Agriculture Council there is a big impetus for streamlining and simplifying some of the existing burden of legislation. We do not plan to remove health and safety standards, of course, but to eliminate bureaucratic burdens when they have no justification and merely add to difficulties for producers. It is unfair of the hon. Gentleman to charge us with wanting to add to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying what successive Ministers have said over the years. However, if the average farmer is asked whether he has to cope with more bureaucracy now than 20 or 25 years ago, he will say that he is coping with mountains of it. I accept that the Minister's intentions are good but the evidence of the past 20 years is that bureaucracy has mushroomed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The BSE controls were clearly not envisaged years ago, and those controls have imposed extra costs and burdens. However, given our largely successful record in tackling BSE, I do not think that people would deny that the burden was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to imports from Germany. I remind him of the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster) made about that. The Food Standards Agency has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
increased to 100 per cent its inspections of imported meat, in the light of those discoveries. It checks all meat that comes from Germany. Nor has the European Commission been idle. It has asked the German Government for details of the controls that they are putting in place. We know from direct contacts with our German counterparts that the German Minister is examining all instances seriously and urgently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of our BSE history, Britain has experience of SRM controls, but countries that are implementing such controls in the wake of BSE incidents lack that experience. It is essential that our controls be exercised in a vigilant way, as I believe they are, but we need also to work with other countries so that the experience of putting effective controls in place can be shared. The hon. Gentleman should see his concerns, some of which I share, in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also mention that both the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire seem to be extraordinary and incurable optimists in respect of political developments in our country over the next few months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quinn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend agree that the hon. Member for Ludlow might have every reason to be optimistic? I understand that he does not intend to stand at the next general election, so this morning could be the last time that he attends this Committee. Does she agree that we will miss his colourful contributions? I, for one, will be very sorry to see him go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had some animated discussions with the hon. Member for Ludlow in various Committees, in European debates and on the Floor of the House, and I concur with the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Vis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the hon. Gentleman's going has given rise to festivities, and given that he is wearing a "pound" pin, perhaps he would like me to make him a knacker's yard pin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's comment allows me to pick up on the concern that the hon. Member for Ludlow expressed about knacker's yards. I should make it clear that there is nothing in the regulation to ban them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire and others who have contributed to the debate raised the very real issue of scientific evidence. To be fair, much of the difficulty for Ministers is that scientific evidence is rarely completely unified. Yesterday, I participated in an interview about foot and mouth disease, and although the vast bulk of scientific evidence is in favour of the Government's current policy of slaughtering, another participant in the interview who was described as a scientist took a different view and advocated vaccination. When considering scientific evidence, Ministers must perhaps err on the side of caution and take note of what is regarded as mainstream, generally accepted advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
However, the approach is not always straightforward, and that is true in the European context as well. The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby rightly expressed concerns about fish meal. There are worries about the risk of cross-contamination, and various views are held about pressure cooking to different standards. We must work together to ensure that at every stage our approach is proportionate—a word that was used by the hon. Members for South-East Cambridgeshire and for Ludlow—has scientific justification and does not cause unilateral and unjustified difficulties in our own industry. Such solutions are not easy to achieve, given the range of different scientific views and explanations. In response to the hon. Gentleman, I will find out what further information we can make available that is not already in the public domain. We are not dealing with a matter on which there is 100 per cent. agreement among all those involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, where there is scientific uncertainty it is important that we know which aspects are the most uncertain, so that we can take the right steps to create a degree of certainty. That is why I urged the Minister to make available an index of the scientific papers that are being used by her advisers and by advisers in other European countries, which would allow us to evaluate whether the action that is taken has a scientific basis or is merely the result of an industry pushing its own line.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reflect on that point. We are keen to be as open and helpful to colleagues as possible in providing information about what is guiding our decisions and making it publicly available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of studies are under way. For example, the destruction of BSE prions by burial, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, is the subject of a research project. So far, we do not have a clear answer to that question. The hon. Gentleman raised an important point. It is sensible that a cat suspected of having a TSE should not be buried. I shall ensure that officials in the Department examine the text on this issue, and if necessary we will be prepared to propose an amendment along those lines. We must tackle the problem in the most appropriate way possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, and I look forward to the conclusion of that investigation. I am glad that she thought that I made a pertinent point. I remind her of its linkage to several other matters that we have discussed, especially the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow about the burdens on farmers. Burial is the easiest way for a farmer to dispose of fallen stock, and I hope that the Government will adopt the view that it should be the basic system of disposal unless scientific evidence suggests that whatever the animal died of will not be destroyed by burial and may re-emerge by leaching, or other means, to infect other animals or humans. We want the simplest system—burial on farms—to apply unless there is scientific evidence to justify an alternative course of disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
I entirely agree with the Minister that the scientific evidence is not precise. However, it is often the case that although the basic scientific knowledge is fairly clear, the conclusions that are derived from it are debatable. In the case of foot and mouth, we all know what vaccination would do—the issue is whether it is a better way to deal with the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's comments. He has expressed concern about burial as a disposal route as well as saying that it should largely be the accepted method. As I said, studies are under way. My understanding of the views expressed by members of the Committee is that there would be considerable concern about the large-scale burial of possibly diseased carcases, which may be incubating BSE.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have concerns about burial—not as to whether it is satisfactory, but as to the consistency of the proposed regulations. Either there is good reason for banning the burial of category 1 items, or there is not. I cannot see why there should be a distinction between pet animals and farm animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Burial is not permitted under category 3, even though it covers material that could be used for human consumption. If a farmer has an animal that does not die of a disease, but breaks its neck, he cannot bury it. It is absurd that he will be saddled with a more serious and costly form of disposal when he could easily bury the animal. After all, he could bury some animals that would be classified under category 2, or in the case of a pet, even under category 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a useful point. I assure him that we will look at burial in respect of the regulations and inform hon. Members of the approach that we plan to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, we have told the Commission that we think that a complete ban on burial in the UK would be impractical, but we have not said that controls should not be further tightened. There are concerns about the burial disposal route. I will reflect on the points that have been raised and draw them to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that response. May I reinforce the Minister's desire to look carefully at the burial issue, which will prove a practical problem for many farmers? Definitions are important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I mentioned islands as an example of remote areas, and we must further examine that issue. I was tempted to discuss the hon. Gentleman's assertion that islands tend to be remote. I am not sure that that is true, but we can all think of UK islands that come under the remote area category. There are also other areas that are a long way from disposal or collection points and we need to show some sympathy there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have responded to points raised about scientific evidence. The main bodies that we listen to are the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
and the relevant European committees, which play the main role on this issue. Scientific views can vary greatly, but we nevertheless turn to those bodies as our formal advisory bodies. We take their opinions very seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we have an assurance from the Minister that bodies such as SEAC will publish the evidence that they use before they advise the Minister? Ministers say—quite rightly—that they are advised by these scientists, but advice does not constitute scientific evidence. It is just an opinion. It would help if a general rule about publishing evidence on which advice is based applied to those committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that SEAC already publishes its proceedings and much of the information that it receives. Obviously, we take a sympathetic approach to increasing access to information and SEAC has tried to make its background information available during the past two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire understandably referred to swill feeding. Current information indicates that if we implement our standards they will be acceptable. The foot and mouth disease outbreak is a concern, so we must examine the evidence gathered by our investigators. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that we must review the use of swill to examine the lessons we can learn. An investigation is under way because we do not know the reason for the outbreak. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that he did not want to prejudge the investigation and I also believe that that would be unwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight mentioned abattoir provision and his point was well made. However, he raised the issue in light of the foot and mouth disease outbreak. Current evidence suggests that although we may deprecate the number of small abattoirs that have closed over the years—the hon. Gentleman gave an example covering 15 years—the risk of spreading foot and mouth disease has been exacerbated not by abattoirs, but by livestock markets and collection points where animals have mixed before being transported. It would be sensible not only to consider the provision of abattoirs, but to examine the livestock market system and the collection of animals before they are moved over long distances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not match current experience. A choice between two abattoirs that are 50 or 100 miles away makes it impossible to maintain local markets, but local abattoirs allow the retention of local markets. Marketing arrangements are currently set up to suit abattoirs and supermarkets. I should like to return to local consumption of locally produced food.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Quin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that we should consider linkages between issues. However, some people—I am not including the hon. Gentleman in this—have said that the foot and mouth disease outbreak is linked to the closure of abattoirs, but current evidence suggests that that is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
When I discussed the issue informally with the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire, we agreed that because of the specialised nature of some abattoirs long-distance travel arrangements have existed for many years—in some cases more than 30 years—to move pigs and especially sows. We must consider all aspects of the situation to learn lessons and to consider the best way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Isle of Wight referred to the important role of grazing in the countryside, and some of the benefits of our forms of agriculture. I agree with the general points that he made so strongly. I also agree with the point made by the hon. Member for Ludlow. We must look at the matter coolly, on the basis of the best available information. The issues can attract an emotional response. There can even be what is called a yuk factor, with people saying, "Oh, that doesn't sound very nice." However, one has to look at
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
the reality in deciding whether a practice is acceptable, especially on health and safety grounds. I assure the Committee that that will motivate the Government's approach to the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
