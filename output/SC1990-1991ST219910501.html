	<section>

	<div class='legislation'>National Health Service Trusts (Consultation before Establishment) (Scotland) Regulations 1991</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alexander Eadie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Midlothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. As you are aware, three separate notices were sent out about this Committee. In the first two notices, the time was 10.30 am, but in the third notice the time was 4.30 pm. As hon. Members are aware, we all have to try to make arrangements based on the timing of various engagements. I shall have to leave the Committee shortly because I am meeting Lord Weinstock to discuss the problems of Ferranti in Edinburgh. That meeting involves the future job prospects of many of my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are not a mundane, technical or administrative matter. They are of great national importance. I should have liked the opportunity to mention some of my constituents' anxieties. I met members of the Lothian health board recently. The possibility was mentioned that the Princess Margaret Rose orthopaedic hospital, which is an important orthopaedic hospital in the Lothian region, might apply for trust status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is entitled to an explanation of the changed meeting time because it now conflicts with other engagements. I wish to be helpful. I suggest that, as this is a matter of national importance, this sitting be adjourned and consideration be given to having this discussion on the Floor of the House. That would give other hon. Members the opportunity to discuss the matter and to question the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that you will accept that motion, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised a point of order, not a motion. Due notice was given of the change in the time of the Committee and, therefore, the Committee is properly constituted. The turnout testifies to that. I understand the hon. Gentleman's difficulty and I appreciate that he has informed the Committee of it. It is not within my power to consider dealing with the matter on the Floor of the House. I am empowered only to conduct the proceedings of the Committee. The hon. Gentleman must take his point up with Mr. Speaker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Mr. Martin. Will you seek guidance and, if necessary, adjourn the Committee to find out whether it is technically possible for this very important issue of national importance to be debated on the Floor of the House, or failing that, by the Scottish Grand Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a separate point of order, will hon. Members who are not members of the Committee be allowed to sit in and participate in the debate or will they get the same heavy-handed treatment that I received three or four years ago
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
when I attempted to sit in on a Standing Committee dealing with a Scottish housing Bill? I was not allowed to take part in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that during consideration of statutory instruments, hon. Members who are not named as members of the committee are entitled to be present and also to speak if they are called. They are not allowed to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not recall the hon. Gentleman being treated by me in a heavy-handed manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mention you, Mr. Martin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not mention me but I think that I know the occasion to which he referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition are praying against the regulations, and that is why Opposition Members will be called to speak first.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Hughes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Martin. The Committee is in great difficulty because the regulations are technically flawed. The Minister should have the opportunity to withdraw the statutory instrument and to bring it back in its proper form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 3(1)(b) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any local authority within whose area or district is or is to be situated any part of such hospital, establishment or facility."</p></blockquote>
Foresterhill in Abedeen, which is wholly within—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member is beginning to debate the statutory instrument. If he is lucky enough to catch my eye, he can raise such matters and also question whether the regulations are flawed. But it is not my duty to consider that aspect. I have been called here to chair this Committee, and that is what I am about to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Martin, you have not answered my question about possible reference to the Scottish Grand Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not possible to refer this matter to the Scottish Grand Committee. The statutory instrument is before this Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.37 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the National Health Service Trusts (Consultation before Establishment) (Scotland) Regulations 1991.</p></blockquote>
First, I must tell my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) that we shall endeavour to bring the issue back to the Scottish Grand Committee at a future date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate today, which is about the consultation that must take place before a hospital opts out, comes at an especially significant time. Guy's hospital, the flagship of opting out in England, is already in severe financial difficulties and must shed jobs. The cuts in services at Guy's hospital are being made not because the services are not needed but because, in the words of the chief executive, they are "not profitable". I repeat, it is not because the services are not needed, but because they are not profitable. It seems that, like the rest of the flagships, Guy's is sinking fast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I appreciate that Guy's hospital and, indeed, all the other hospitals in England are not the responsibility of the Minister of State, Scottish Office, but they are of particular relevance to the consultation process that we are discussing today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Guy's hospital, information was held back from those consulted and the consultation leading to opt-out was a sham, which we consider will happen in Scotland. The decisions had already been made and Guy's was allowed to opt-out, irrespective of the consultative process and of the hospital's serious financial position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was boasted at Guy's hospital that it was very well managed. It was considered to be so financially sound that it was given an external finance borrowing limit of £8.5 million. We should remember that two thirds of the opted-out hospitals were not given any borrowing limit. But Guy's was considered to be so financially sound that the Treasury gave it an £8.5 million borrowing limit. Yet, only one month after Guy's opted out, it is in severe financial difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parallels with Scotland are uncanny. Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and South Ayrshire district general hospital are the flagships of opt-out in Scotland. It is claimed that they, too, are well managed and financially sound—exactly the same claims were made for Guy's hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, can the Minister assure us that in those hospitals, and in the Royal Scottish National hospital at Larbert, there will be no job cuts if they opt-out? Can the Minister assure us that no doctor, nurse, paramedic or ancillary worker will lose his or her job as a result of any of those hospitals opting out? During the consultation process that has now started, I believe that everyone is entitled to know the answers to those questions, and we await the Minister's reply with considerable interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly, Mr. Barbour, the manager at Foresterhill, feels unable to give such assurances. Therefore, we must conclude that, as at Guy's, hospital opt-out in Scotland will mean not only job losses but, more importantly, a significant reduction in patient care. As at Guy's hospital, services will go simply because they are unprofitable, not because they are not needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The business plans of these hospitals do not give us confidence. Unlike my hon. Friends in England, I have seen the business plans of the three hospitals in Scotland. Ayrshire and Arran expect to retain a surplus in the first year of £161,000—a 1 per cent. return on capital. That is hardly enough to be viable. Foresterhill in Aberdeen requires a capital injection, according to the business plan, of £13 million. Are those hospitals to opt out on that basis? The fact that the hospitals have even applied to opt out is astonishing when one considers their business plans. The Ayrshire and Arran business plan states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These close links with the community mean that the Trusts will respond sensitively to local needs."</p></blockquote>
Is not it odd that the hospital has ignored local opinion by pushing ahead with the proposal against the wishes of local people? No wonder the business plans are considered to be nothing but cynical hype.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is more rubbish. The Ayrshire and Arran business plan continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A series of tasks was identified and responsibility for completion allocated under the timetable set."</p></blockquote>
That is terrific. It really helps to make up our minds whether it is a sound proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
There is more:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The premise for this plan is that the South Ayrshire Hospitals will become an NHS trust."</p></blockquote>
That is a piece of information of which we were not aware! The business plans are a mixture of shaky premise, nasty hype and dodgy financial assumption, nothing more than vague waffle, eulogising warm weather, mom and apple pie. The business plan for Aberdeen Royal infirmary is so vague that it is impossible to know what is going on and to make judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should accept that now is the time to stop the silly, unwanted, unloved and damaging process of opting out. The hospitals should be kept firmly with the health board and within the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, despite the shambles, consultation is to go ahead, the wishes of the staff and the local people should be decided only by a ballot. Why has the Minister told the health boards not to hold ballots? Can he confirm that the regulations do not prevent a health board from taking a consultative ballot of the staff and the local community?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is opposed to ballots, and I understand why. Every ballot that has been conducted so far has shown that a majority of staff and local people is opposed to opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification. Can the hon. Gentleman tell me what he means by the local community? In a rural constituency such as mine, people travel 40 or 50 miles to a hospital. Would they be balloted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that there are practical difficulties but, as long as we accept the principle, there can be various selective ballots. I shall not go into details because that would take too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The South Ayrshire consultants voted by 50 to 9–82 per cent.—against their new hospital opting out. In a local community ballot of more than 4,000 residents on the streets of Ayr, 97 per cent. were opposed to the hospital opting out. At Foresterhill hospital in Aberdeen, senior consultants and staff voted by 87 to 2 against opting out. At the Royal Scottish National hospital in Larbert, 95 per cent. of the staff—812—were against opting out and only 4 per cent.—34—were in favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With such opposition expressed in ballots, I can understand why the Minister is reluctant to go down that road. Why let democracy get in the way of ideology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked whether I was in favour of a ballot whenever a hospital was closed because he believes that to be the logical consequence of ballots. I am not in favour of such ballots, and that is not a logical consequence of them. We do not hold a ballot every time a new hospital is opened so there is no reason to do so whenever a hospital is closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason for a ballot is that health boards, which will play a pivotal role in the consultation exercise and can influence it, have already severely compromised their neutrality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take up the hon. Gentleman's time, but I am interested in his argument that it is not appropriate to hold a ballot if a service is to be withdrawn entirely by closing a hospital, but that a ballot is necessary if there is to be a change of management in a hospital. That seems to be inconsistent because in both cases consultation is carried out by the health boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we do not have a ballot when we open a hospital, it is not necessary to have one when a hospital is closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main reasons for ballots is that health boards will play an important role in the consultation process, both in the production of the documents for consultation and in responding to the consultations. The health boards have already severely compromised their neutrality and we cannot expect them to undertake the consultation process fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to realise that the chairmen of all three health boards which have made formal applications to opt out—Ayrshire and Arran, Forth Valley and Grampian—are publicly identified as active Tory supporters, if not actually party members. In the Minister's constituency, the Forth Valley health board, which includes the Royal Scottish National hospital, has as its chairman a member of the Conservative party. Those chairmen may be neutral, but it is doubtful whether an unbiased assessment will be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Grampian health board has consistently supported Foresterhill opting out against the wishes of its staff. In a press release on 7th March 1991, the chairman, Mr James Kyle, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Members of Grapmpian Health Board voted to recommend that the Foresterhill Hospital Unit should apply to become an NHS Trust".</p></blockquote>
How is that for impartiality? That is the group that will conduct the ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bias of the chairman of the Ayrshire and Arran health board, Mr Bill Fyfe, and his double dealing are a matter of considerable concern. He openly supports the South Ayrshire district general hospital becoming a trust and has proudly stated so in public and in private. To achieve that, he is willing to move the goal posts at anytime. He stated in the Glasgow Herald in March last year:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The decision with opt-out rests, and has always rested with the hospital doctors. It cannot be otherwise: self-governing will happen only with the doctors' approval. No-one—and certainly not the Unit General Manager—can force this move down their throats".</p></blockquote>
Yet that is exactly what he is doing. The doctors voted 82 to 2 against opting out, but they will have that forced down their throats. How can anyone in Ayrshire and Arran have any confidence in the consultative process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not throw at me the example of the Forfar hospitals to illustrate his open-mindedness. We all know that he has rejected their efforts to have trust status. Anyone who knows anything about this subject could have told the doctors in Forfar right from the start that their proposals were not viable. I met them early on and explained that they were being used cynically by the Minister and their Member of Parliament so that they could claim that there was interest among doctors for opting out. Dr Peterkin is a good friend of mine, and I warned him against that and said that at the end of the day they would have spent a lot of time and effort for nothing. I told them that they would be better engaged in fighting for their new hospital and trying to retain maternity provision, rather than going down the cul-de-sac of opting out. Alas, all my predictions have proved correct and it is no wonder that Dr Peterkin and his colleagues are bitterly disappointed and depressed. Those who urged them down that line will not be forgotten or forgiven.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>; Before the hon. Gentleman makes accusations, he should check his facts carefully and thoroughly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
I did not approach doctors in Forfar. On the contrary, they approached me. Nor have I approached any other doctors in my constituency. When a constituent—a doctor or otherwise—comes to me to talk about something that he wants to do, I, as a Member of Parliament, do the best that I can to assist him. That is exactly what I have done in Forfar. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will retract what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman should get so twitchy. I never said that he approached doctors in Forfar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The record will show that I did not say that I approached them about anything. I only said that he encouraged them. I well remember the hon. Gentleman eulogising about opted-out hospitals and saying in the House that he would do what he could to encourage them. At that time, I said that that was the wrong course for doctors, and I have been proved correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now turn to the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey). He asked what weight would be given to the opinions of individuals and groups consulted about opting out. Will the Minister reject applications if most people oppose them? Or will he make his own value judgments about the response that he receives? Will quantity or quality of opinion decide?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Business plans make specious comments such as,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Trust will respond sensitively to local needs and demands"</p></blockquote>
but they do not make it clear how that will come about. It is merely an opinion of those involved in the business plans. Surely such claims should be counteracted by the views of doctors who believe that trust hospitals will be less responsive to local needs and will not be in the long-term interests of their patients. It is doctors, after all, and not managers, who look after sick patients. Should not more weight be given to their opinions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister accept the views of the majority? Will he take what doctors say seriously? Or will he, as I said earlier, make his own value judgments about conflicting opinions? Whose views will be ignored, and whose accepted? We are all agreed that the consultation process is a sham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decisions, as in the case of Guy's hospital, have already been made. In England—no matter how great the opposition—unwanted trusts have been forced on an unwilling population. Nevertheless, I urge people to respond to consultations and to oppose the applications. At least that will prevent the Government from claiming that nobody opposes hospitals' opting out. The Government will only be able to approve applications against widespread opposition; and they will have to, in Bill Fyfe's own words
	<br><blockquote><p>"force them down the throats"</p></blockquote>
of the people of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I conclude with specific points about the regulations, which talk about local authorities being consulted. Presumably, that means district and regional authorities. Will the Minister respond and clarify that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals are a sham. They are unwanted, and I urge everyone to become involved and reject the proposals once and for all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.55 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Scottish Office (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a timely opportunity to debate the regulations, but I fear that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) has spent more of his time talking about the mythology that the Labour party has created around NHS trusts than about the proposals before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no brief to speak for Guy's hospital. However, one point seems to have escaped the hon. Gentleman—that Guy's hospital had a serious problem because its expenditure substantially exceeded its income. Hospital management wanted to develop new services, and that involves the transference of resources from one area to another. In whatever way a hospital was run—by a health authority or as an NHS trust—that problem would remain, and decisions about priorities for expenditure would still have to be taken. Decisions about possible redundancies would also be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of the central difficulties of Guy's hospital arose from its becoming an NHS trust. The Opposition put forward the extraordinary proposition that it is better to take diffucult decisions about finance and about meeting commitments to improve services above the heads of hospital management, at health authority or departmental level. I find that difficult to understand. We should take a step forward in patient care if the managers and doctors who are directly involved on a day-to-day basis were given responsibility for taking their decisions—which is implied by NHS trust status—if they were released from the bureaucracy and red tape about which they have complained for years, or if they were given the advantage of carrying money forward from one financial year to the next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked, "What guarantees can you give me about jobs?" We should be seeking guarantees on behalf of patients. The nub of the question is whether NHS trusts will result in better quality services for patients. An awareness of those points was singularly absent from the hon. Gentlemans's remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for the assurance that there would be no job reductions. The health service in Scotland enjoys expenditure that is between 25 per cent. and 30 per cent. higher than that south of the border. None of the hospitals that are applying for NHS trust status has any financial problems. Intrinsic to the idea of NHS trust status is the freedom for hospitals to develop or introduce new services. Of course there will be changes in the pattern of service. Only a fool would ask for a hospital to be frozen in aspic when it becomes an NHS trust. I guarantee the hon. Gentleman that no NHS trust will be approved by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State unless he believes that it will improve patient care. The hon. Gentleman should welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentelman advocated the curious idea that ballots were necessary for NHS trust status, and that they would require a yes or no answer to a complex question. He also said that there would be no ballots for closure proposals. He will not have ballots for closure proposals because those proposals have to be considered carefully, and arguments have to be weighed. The staff in the hospitals that are involved are genuinely opposed to hospital closures. I have never known staff to think otherwise. The proposals must further the interests of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
community and of patient care. Those interests do not have yes or no solutions. That is why the hon. Gentleman repudiated the idea of ballots for closures, yet he argued that ballots were necessary when there were changes in management, from above the heads of hospital management, to local level. That is inconsistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman wants ballots because he spent the past six months with his colleagues going round the country misrepresenting NHS trusts, and telling people that they represent privatisation by the back door. For example, Systems 3 did a well-conducted survey in the constituency of the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) about attitudes towards NHS trust status. Apparently, only 24 per cent. of 1,024 people supported NHS trust status. The hon. Gentleman would use that figure to argue against NHS trust status. The main reasons the people gave for opposing NHS trust status, according to Systems 3, were that private patients would be given preference; that there would be more interest in making money than in health care; that they would not get the same attention; that people could not afford it; or that there would be less money available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister should be allowed to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not true. Opposition Members do a singular disservice to managers and consultants in the health service, who are committed to the health service, and who have supported the proposals because they believe them to be in the interests of patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes) was one of those who said that the findings of the survey were true. One of the grounds given was that private patients would be given preference, which is completely untrue. NHS trusts will operate under a contra to the health board. They will have to specify the standard, quality and quantity of care that they deliver and will be contractually bound for it. Private patients will not be given preference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said that the trusts will be more interested in making money than in providing health care. For the first time, NHS trust hospitals will be under a contractual obligation to deliver a quantity of health care, so that allegation is slander. Opposition Members say that patients would not recieve the same attention. On the contrary, patients would go to a hospital that was locally managed. They say that people will not be able to afford care. NHS trust hospitals will be NHS hospitals; there will be no charging. Legislation specifically precludes that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that less money will be available. Only six months ago, the Labour party alleged that hospitals were being bribed to opt-out by being offered more money. Faced with an idea that they cannot attack on its merits, the Opposition have been reduced to misrepresenting the facts and holding ballots based on proposals that have not been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot glibly, in half a sentence, wave away the distrust that is felt by all people who work in those hospitals, never mind the politics of the matter. Will the Minister give me a straight forward answer? If consultation is held fairly and squarely—there are grave doubts about that—and an overwhelming majority of those consulted oppose the idea of opting out, even after hearing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Government propaganda, will he review the position, not on the basis of his personal bias, but on the evidence, and stop the opting out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will follow the policy that the hon. Gentleman suggests: he will consider the proposal on merit, as we would for hospital closures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion that health boards somehow operated in a biased way because they have gone through consultation and expressed an opinion is absurd. For each hospital closure, consultation is undertaken by the health board, which will already have decided that a hospital should close. Sometimes my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State overturns that decision. I should find the hon. Members expression of concern for staff more convincing if his hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden did not put pressure on health service managers, even suggesting that their employment prospects would diminish under a Labour Government if they went ahead with the reforms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite untrue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wishes to deny it, I shall be happy to read from a minute of a meeting that he attended in Ayrshire on 15 October at which he suggested to the general manager of a health board that his party
	<br><blockquote><p>"would not accord priority to management staff in opted out hospitals in terms of their re-employment in the NHS."</p></blockquote>
Apparently, the hon. Gentleman had discussed the matter with the Institute of Health Services Management which had registered its concern, and thought that the last in, first out policy would prevail. That is a disgraceful attempt to put pressure on managers who are trying to get the best deal for patients. I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition shares my view, and will have nothing to do with the idea. The hon. Member for Livingston made it clear on the Floor of the House recently that he repudiated that view. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will take this opportunity to make it clear that he also has changed his stance of last October.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to withdraw. I am not sure that a minute from Ayrshire and Arran health board can be believed because the board has been double dealing on this issue all along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked at that meeting what would happen if the trusts were brought back within the NHS. I replied that we could not give guarantees about jobs and that if there was duplication of jobs, some might have to go. I explained the position to the Institute of Health Services Management, which thought it entirely reasonable. Everyone accepts that. Therefore I have nothing to withdraw.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We began with pious claims that we ought to listen to people in the NHS and end up being told that we cannot trust what members of health boards say about what took place at a meeting attended by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. The hon. Gentleman knows that his party put pressure on managers to the extent that his right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition had to denounce it. The hon. Member for Livingston said on the Floor of the House that he repudiated that view. I have no doubt that the chairman and the general manager of
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Ayrshire and Arran health board will wish to make the position clear in the light of the hon. Gentleman's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Foulkes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I confirm that the minute that the Minister quoted was written by Mr. Eckford? If so, my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) is right not to trust it. The Ayrshire Members of Parliament have regular meetings with that health board and I have had occasion to write to Mr. Eckford because his minutes are not a true and accurate account of what took place at that meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will no doubt need to reconcile his comments with those of the general manager of the health board. Mr. Eckford is one of the best general managers in the health service and has given distinguished service. The hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) confirms that. He served on the Fourth Valley health board. I am sorry that Opposition Members should seek to portray Mr. Eckford in that way. It merely makes my point that their support for the views of the health service goes only so far as those views agree with the position taken by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Opposition Members can put politics to one side in considering this issue and, for once, consider the interests of the patients. The hon. Member for Falkirk, West scoffs, but he should know that, in the case of the Royal Scottish National hospital, which is in his constituency and has applied for trust status, the proposals have come from all the consultants and management and not from the Scottish Office. The consultants and management believe that those proposals can improve patient care. Opposition Members should remember that those people are involved in patient care and at least examine the proposals, take advantage of the consultation period to consider them on their merits and apply only one criterion: will the patients be better off? They should do that rather than think of what the National Union of Public Employees or the Conferderation of Health Service Employees say should be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the case of the Royal Scottish National hospital, the opt-out proposals were initiated by the management team, headed by Mr. Derek Polliacchi, who has no direct experience of patient care. Most of his management team have no such direct experience. A ballot of those involved in patient care showed that 95 per cent. rejected the opt-out proposals. How on earth can the Minister justify trying to bulldoze measures through against such opposition from the staff? Patient care is dependent on staff morale. Such a divergence between the management and the staff directly involved in patient care will inevitably cause patients to suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that the hon. Member for Falkirk, West does notk now this, because he would not wish to mislead the Committee, but it was the unanimous view of the consultants that the decision to opt out would be better for patient care. [Hon. Members: "No"] All the consultants took that view. They were all involved in the decision with the management. The hon. Member for Falkirk, West referred to a 95 per cent. rejection, but that was before there were detailed proposals to accept, reject or study. The hon. Gentleman, alas, had made up his mind in advance.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0255">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The regulations provide for proper consultation. They provide for a core group to be consulted. Each NHS trust application will be consulted upon. Wider groups will be consulted—in Ayrshire, for example, all six Members of Parliament will be consulted. In other areas, other groups will need to be consulted. Everyone will have their say. At the end of the day, the criterion will be patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden made much of the Forfar proposal. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) helped and supported Dr. Peterkin. I pay tribute to the work that Dr. Peterkin did in Forfar. However, the proposals did not seem to offer the opportunity for improved patient care. For that reason we suggested that the proposals should be reconsidered. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden told the Committee that he knew that from the beginning, but he has told people outside that the Government accept every proposal for NHS trust status regardless and that we are dragooning people into applying. I ask the hon. Gentleman to accept that we consider each proposal on its merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that accurate report of the circumstances in Forfar. He will also confirm that, in view of the first assessment, Dr. Peterkin is busy trying to have the proposal reconsidered in different ways? That can hardly be put down to arm-twisting on my part or by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. It cannot be in the interests of the health service or of patient care for managers and doctors who voluntarily wish to take advantage of the proposals to be, personally repudiated and attacked. I regret that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has become involved in that. He has accused people involved in the south Ayrshire application. He was quoted as saying that they had acted
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the personal prestige and satisfaction of a few individuals".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) said the same thing. The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) was reported as attacking the chairman-designate, Mr. Douglas Brown, claiming that
	<br><blockquote><p>"He and a few cronies are conspiring to get their hands on the new Ayrshire hospital".</p></blockquote>
Mr. Brown is a distinguished orthopaedic surgeon who has agreed to serve as chairman of the new trust. His record of service to the NHS at least entitles him to a proper hearing, and his proposals to proper consideration. I hope that all hon. Members will take the consultation process for what it is—an opportunity to examine the proposals not on a political basis but on the basis of the interests of the health service. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Aberdeen, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief because I know that many of my colleagues want to speak. The regulations are totally defective. Regulation 3 refers to "Persons to be consulted" and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The relevant body which is under a duty to consult …shall consult the following bodies:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(a) any local health council"—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There is only one now in most cases, so that does not matter—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(b) any local authority within whose area or district is or is to be situated any part of such hospital, establishment of facility;"</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Minister must know that in Aberdeen the infirmary at Foresterhill, which is considering opting out to NHS trust status, serves patients not only in the city of Aberdeen. Within a couple of miles are the Gordon district, the Kincardine and Deeside district and the Moray district, all of which send patients to the hospital. It is no use the Minster's saying "we shall" because there is nothing in the document which says that other people may be consulted.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just told the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hughes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not care what the hon. Gentleman told me; he must answer my question about the regulations. The regulations refer to a series of people who shall be consulted. They say how people should be consulted, but nothing about other persons being consulted at the board's discretion. The board is tied to the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister always talks about local authorities spending money. If the district councils outside Aberdeen spent money on collecting people's views, they could be challenged because they are not named as being eligible to be consulted. The regulations are defective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use the Minister's saying, "The board can consult MPs if it wants." It does not say so in the document. It specifically states how the process should work and who the consultees should be. That is tragic, The problem is the weight that is given to the point of view of the board and of those who oppose the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are angry about that in Aberdeen. The process started with an expression of interest. A working party took it a bit further. Then in December 1990, the unit area medical committee was bounced into deciding to make an application. That decision was trumpeted in a press release by the board and in the newspapers as a great advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within two months, the UAMC met again. During that consultation period, every department apart from laboratory services had been consulted. Every department and every medical speciality, from consultants down, said that they did not wish to opt out. The doctors, nurses and surgeons on the unit area medical committee voted overwhelmingly not to opt out in a second vote. That was the decision of the medical staff. Following that decision, the board spent two days trying to rubbish UAMC, having previously said how good it was. The board put out a press release. I sought to explain UAMC's change of mind by saying that the committee was worried about the Gulf war or about the possibility of a general election. The board sought to do anything but accept the UAMC's decision. UAMC is an acronym. The board changed the committee's name to the Foresterhill unit committee. Members of the committee can work out what acronym that forms. That is what the board for themselves is saying to the medical staff at Foresterhill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was the point of the consultations? What is the point in the Minister saying that the contracts will specify how private patients will be treated? I am sure that the Minister will correct me if a I am wrong in saying that there are seven private beds on the Foresterhill site at the moment. Mr. Barber said that the trust could make money by increasing the number of private beds to 100. How is it possible to provide 100 private beds in the Foresterhill hospital without reducing and damaging the care of the national health service patients? It is not possible. If 100 beds are taken out of public service and put into private use, that will reduce the service to the sick and the ill in Aberdeen. That is indisputable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I tabled a question to the Minister asking him to publish the standard contract. He replied that there is no standard contract. The contract for each hospital depends on how it deals with the application. If that is the case, how can the Minister assure the Committee that the treatment of private patients and the treatment of NHS patients will be stipulated in the contract? If the information had been published, the Committee might be able to deal with it in a more confident way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board made its prejudice clear through its recommendation that the hospital opt out. A former board member, Mr. Kyle, told me that that is not what the board decided. He told me that no one knew what the board had decided because no proper resolution was put to the board. He said that all the board decided was that it would give a contract, subject to conditions, to anybody who made an opt-out application. I have asked the Minister to make the minutes of the board meeting available in the Library, but he said that publication of the minutes was a matter for the board. The board took the decision in closed session. Everything has been done behind closed doors. We are not getting true information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes I feel sorry for the Minister. He can report in answers only the information that he is given. In his parliamentary answer to me, he said that the board had made known its willingness to make the minutes of its meeting available to me. The board had not done so before that answer and has not done so since. That is wrong. If the board was interested in giving me that information, it could send me the minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All along the line, information has been withheld. All along the line, the board has taken private decisions. It has used the Grampian board's public relations machinery to push one idea and to rubbish any cause that is different from the Minister's. That is why we are distrustful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave an assurance that trust hospitals would remain within the health service. I warn every hon. Member that the role model for privatisation of the NHS trusts is the trust ports—the measure is on its way through Parliament now. The idea that local business people would run the trust ports has been cast aside; the Minister says that ports must privatise within two years or they will be compelled to do so. That is his hidden agenda for the health service, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, and others, we shall use every possible machinery for consultation. The Minister must give an undertaking that he will accept the views of local people, doctors and others involved or he will not be doing his job as a Minister of the Crown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to be called immediately after the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes), as we share an interest in Foresterhill hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have expressed my reservations about the principle of opting out before. I shall therefore direct my remarks to the matter of consultation rather than to the general principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make two points, the first being on the issue of ballots. There is a difference of scale between a ballot on the opening or closure of a hospital and one on a constitutional change in the governing of a hospital. It is important to make that distinction. Secondly, I beg my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Minister to understand the degree of divisiveness among the medical staff at Foresterhill as a result of the working group's proposal. Nothing works well when staff are divided, and patient care will suffer at the end of the day. I hope that my hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland will take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to know how consultation will be conducted and what will be its result. That is critical. Balance, especially when there is a ballot of the public, is a matter for debate. There are physical difficulties involved in holding an extensive ballot and ultimately there can only be general expressions of opinion. I note that my hon. Friend the Minister rejects the suggestion of a ballot on opting out, yet he referred to opinion polls commissioned by the Scottish Office on the subject of his proposals for schools. I detect a slight inconsistency in his views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not agree more with my hon. Friend that the only thing that matters is patient care. Who is the judge of patient care? I believe that it should be the medical staff—the consultants, senior doctors and nurses. I have conducted nearly all my research at Foresterhill among those members of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have complete confidence in the integrity and independence of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of state for Scotland and in the way that he will consider the result of consultations. However, the local senior medical staff are far better judges of patient care than the Secretary of State for Scotland or, with respect to them, any civil servants in the Scottish Office. That is the critical area. I should like my hon. Friend to assure me that the freely-expressed views of medical staff in the hospitals involved will be seriously considered. That is the professional opinion that is most relevant to patient care. Patient care is my main concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the consultations will contribute to the final decision of the Secretary of State, it is vital that the consultations are fairly and properly carried out. In general, my understanding of what has happened is identical to that of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North, although it is obtained from some different sources. They bear out what he said. What worries me about consultations is that they must be conducted by the health board. For consultations to have public confidence, whatever the subject of the consultations there must be confidence in the integrity and independence of those who carry them out. The Grampian health board made a major mistake, as I have said before, in coming out publicly in favour of opting out in the knowledge that it would have to carry out the consultations.

I hope that the board will carry out the consultations independently, but many members of the public-and I have had much mail on the subject from fair-minded, responsible people—believe that the health board has prejudiced its position and are not confident that the consultations will be carried out independently. Whatever the facts, if there is such feeling, deep local anxiety will develop about whether the results of the consultations will be correctly presented to the Secretary of State and whether his decision will be based on the feelings of local people. Certainly, in Aberdeen the method of the consultations puts great doubts in my mind and in the minds of thousands of other people, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to follow up the point made by the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North on regulation 3(1)(b). It stood out a mile when I read it that there is no obligation to consult my district council. It is a fundamental weakness in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the statutory instrument. Of course, the health board is free to consult whomever it wishes. I suggest that that is the answer that I shall receive. If the board is legally obliged to consult the City of Aberdeen district council, it is not a level playing field if my district council is excluded by the wording of the statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to confine myself to what the statutory instrument covers, but I have the gravest possible doubts. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can reassure me on one thing—if only one thing—and that is that the opinions of senior medical staff will bear the most weight with the Secretary of State. That is where I will put my support as their opinions on patient care are the ones that I respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hughes), I shall try to be brief. The right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside said nothing with which I disagree. Without being patronising, I admire the principled stand that the right hon. Gentleman has taken on the matter on behalf of his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) has been my friend for a long time. I hope that our friendship will not be damaged by what I say, but I should be failing in the standards that I set for myself if I did not enter a defence of Jim Eckford. I have known him for more than 20 years. He worked in the health service in Forth Valley and in my native Fife for many years. He has a long-standing commitment to the national health service that I must put on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I deal with the Minister, I shall comment on Aberdeen. I have no direct involvement in Aberdeen, but the Minister should recognise that there is a special problem in respect of Foresterhill hospital, Aberdeen. No other city in Scotland has such a high concentration of beds and specialties in one hospital. Edinburgh, Perth, Glasgow or Dundee cannot be compared. The Minister must consider that important fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reinforce what the hon. Gentleman says. As he raised the matter, I should not like it to be thought that I was not interested in that point. One of my major reservations about Aberdeen opting out is that it is the only general hospital in the area. Opting out there would not increase the choice for general practitioners or patients about which hospital they use. I grant the case that in a large urban area with several general hospitals, one hosital opting out experimentally would provide more choice. That argument is not relevant in the case of Aberdeen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that we have highlighted a crucial element in the case of Aberdeen. The Minister complains on this subject as on others that he is being misrepresented in Scotland. I am an innocent guy, and I find that charge difficult to understand. I read in today's 
	<i>Hansard</i> a written answer to a question tabled the day before yesterday. In it, the Scottish Office revealed that the number of Scottish information officers increased between 1979 and 1991 from 22 to 34. With that increase of information officers, the Minister still cannot get his point across. That is not misrepresentation, but the people of Scotland using their good, sound common sense to reject what the Minister tries to push down their throats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
I shall deal with the statutory instrument, which outlines the consultation process. The document lays down that the health board will conduct consultations. I agree with the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside that the health board must remain impartial if it is to conduct such consultations. The role of such boards in the matter is similar to that of the Secretary of State in deciding whether to call in planning applications. If the right hon. Gentleman wrote to the Secretary of State about a planning application, the Secretary of State would reply that he could not give an answer because he might be the final arbiter of the problem. Health boards will not be the final arbiters in the matter, but they must be seen to conduct the consultations fairly and openly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North raised a valid point. There is a high probability of an application from Stirling Royal Infirmary—in the Minister's constituency—to opt out. In that event, Clackmannan and Falkirk district councils, from whose areas patients are referred to that hospital, have a right to be consulted. The Minister cannot argue that it is all right for him to approve the transfer of department after department from Falkirk and district royal infirmary to Stirling Royal Infirmary yet, when the application to opt out arrives, deny the people of Falkirk—who must travel to Stirling for treatment—the right to be consulted. Surely the Minister must make it absolutely clear that all the district council areas, whence patients are referred to the hospital, have a statutory right to be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instrument prescribes the bodies that have a statutory right to be consulted. It also lays down that, if requested, the health board will publish the submissions made during the consultation period. That is interesting and I hope that all those involved in the consultations will ensure that submissions are published, because that will be an important element in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next stage is that the submissions will go to the Secretary of State, although we all know that they will go first to the Minister of State. He will cast his beady eye over them and make recommendations to the Secretary of State for Scotland who—being what he is, whoever he is, whenever he is—will be so busy that he will not have the time to scan the detail of the documents, so he will accept Minister of State's recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want a guarantee from the Minister of State, because that will be more important than obtaining one from the Secretary of State. Will the Minister guarantee that, if Stirling Royal Infirmary makes an opt-out proposal, consultations take place and all those defined in the statutory instrument as having a statutory right to be consulted oppose the opt-out and, moreover, all, or the vast majority, of those whom the health board consults—even if it is not statutorily obliged to consult them—oppose the opt-out proposal, he will not ignore his constituent's wishes and will not therefore proceed with the opt-out proposals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may localise the issue for a moment. The Forth Valley health board has a serious problem. The Minister knows that Striling Royal Infirmary has still not been recognised by the College of Anaesthetists as a training hospital for anaesthetists because the range of anaesthetic work available there is not wide enough to enable the college to recognise it as a training hospital. The infirmary lost that recognition because it lost the range of work. It seems that the way to build up that range of work is to transfer departments from Falkirk and district royal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
infirmary, but I shall not let that happen. That infirmary is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Canavan) and we will not allow that to happen—we have fought for too long to build up the royal infirmary at Falkirk. However, the danger exists and the opt-out proposals would aggravate it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps for a minute I part company with the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith). I am interested in the heavy emphasis that the Minister and others place on the opinion of consultants. The consultants who will decide whether a hospital opts out or stays in are the same people who are prepared to work—I shall not get involved in a debate on private medical care—in Ross Hall, in Murrayfield and in a private hospital in Stirling without having an ounce of say in how those establishments are run. They have no say at all in how they are run but they do not find it hard to swallow their principles when they go there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want more cognisance to be taken of the views of patients, of ancillary staff and of the nurses who are there long after the consultants have moved on. The most stable part—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ewing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and qualified Friend should not tempt me to digress along those lines. In any hospital, the longest serving staff are the nurses and the ancillary workers. They are there for much longer and their views should be given much more weight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have persuaded the Minister that the regulations are flawed. He must guarantee that there will be widespread consultation. As a democrat—this is a challenge—he must surely accept that if the results are against his wishes, he must accept those results and not impose his prejudice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak from a different point of view from that of others who have spoken. I welcome the regulations and the emphasis on consultation. In Forfar there has been extensive local consultation. Even the local newspaper—the Forfor Dispatch—has carried out consultation, according to which a tiny minority was opposed to the GPs' proposals but many were keen to have what the GPs proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The GPs have written to me again this week putting forward innovative and imaginative proposals. They are motivated by the one desire to provide the best possible standard of patient care. They believe that they have the support of the people, the consultants and all those who wish to be part of their imaginative and innovative proposals. I have suggested to my hon. Friend the Minister that their ideas should be considered by an independent body to see what merit those proposals have; they may be path-finding proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present position in Forfar arose bacause the health board has promised for more than 20 years to provide a community hospital but has failed to do so. Not unnaturally, the GPs, who want the best possible patient care, have to operate from three separate hospitals in Forfar and wonder when they will get a new community hospital. At a public meeting in Forfar the health board pledged to provide such a hospital by 1992—that is going to be a marvellous year because it seems that that is when
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
everything will happen. Since then, there have been conflicting signals and apparently that was not what the health board intended. It is uncertain what the health board is offering or planning to do, but it is clear why the people of Forfar and their GPs want to take control of their own destiny. They want to provide the desired health care in their area and they believe that they can do so. Therefore, the proposals merit consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a different story from those emerging from other places. If Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) are sincere, they should not criticise the Forfar proposals. I want it put on the record that people in Forfar and their GPs have expressed their views and I, as their Member of Parliament, am doing what every other hon. Member would do. I am supporting them because I believe that they are right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arguments against a general hospital opting out are very strong and have been eloquently expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). The arguments against a hospital for mentally handicapped people opting out are even stronger. I am not alone in believing that. The vast majority of people in Scotland agree that it is obscene to suggest that commercial criteria should be introduced into the care of mentally handicapped people who deserve nothing but the best and whose needs should never be determined by market forces. It is incredible that the first hospital management team in Scotland to express an interest in opting out was that of the Royal Scottish National Hospital in my constituency, which caters for mentally handicapped patients. It is also one of the first hospital managements to produce a business plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations relate to consltation. If consultation proposals were genuine, these madcap regulations would never have seen the light of day, especially in relation to the RSNH, 95 per cent. of whose staff vehemently oppose opting out. The majority of patients' relatives who have contacted me also oppose the idea in principle, and even those who do not have grave reservations about the future of relatives who are patients at the hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local community organisations that have approached me strongly oppose the proposals, as do individuals who do not share my political beliefs. It is incumbent upon the Minister to listen to members of his own party, even if he does not listen to us. Nationally, many Tories have grave reservations not only about what will happen to the RSNH but about the health service in Scotland as a whole if the proposals are implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the right hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) is not alone among his Scottish Tory colleagues in expressing reservations about or opposition to the proposals. Today's edition of the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> reports a meeting between Scottish Tory MPs and the Secretary of State at which opposition to the NHS opt-out proposals was expressed. Perhaps the Minister can tell us about the meeting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may wonder who favours the proposals for the Royal Scottish National Hospital, and from where they emanate. The proposals were initiated by the hospital's management. I reiterate that none of those people has direct experience of patient care. I do not know where the Minister obtained the information that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
consultants at RSNH were unanimously in favour of opting out. That is not the information that I was given when last I discussed the subject at the hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local health board also appears to favour opting out. The board is, of course, headed by a good friend and political ally of the Minister, Mrs. Isbister, who is a leading member of his constituency Tory party and a local Tory councillor. These are the types of Tory party lackeys whom the Minister is appointing to chair health boards, and they are surrounded by other party hacks who merely do as they are told. Many have no experience whatever of the health service and do not appear to have even its basic interests at heart. Little wonder that I heard recently that Alistair Robertson, the general manager of the Forth Valley health board, has resigned. It would be diffcult for anyone to achieve a good working relationship with that woman, Mrs. Isbister, whom the Minister appointed to chair the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do the majority of people in the area oppose the proposals? Understandably, they are worried about their job security and conditions of service. It is not surprising, when we consider the example of Guy's hospital and the Bradford hospital which have already opted out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister about one matter: jobs are very important, in the health service or outside it. The service that jobs provides—patient care—is more important than the jobs itself. The No. 1 criterion for deciding whether to accept the proposals should be patient care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Staff morale is relevant to patient care.—It spells disaster for staff morale when staff and management are at loggerheads about the way to run a hospital, and that in turn spells disaster for the standards of patient care. Mentally handicapped patients and their relatives need the long-term guarantee of continuity in funding and in the supply of resources. That is best realised by keeping hospitals fully integrated in the national health service
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposed arrangements, self-governing trusts will try to establish contact with the Forth Valley health board and other health boards, and with local authorities to administer community care. That will introduce a terrible element of uncertainty. If a trust faced a potential deficit in its budget, it would face the grave temptation of finding other ways to raise income, for example by selling off its assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An element of such behaviour has already crept into the Forth Valley health board area, because the Scottish Office pressurised the health board to maximise its capital assets. There is a disgraceful proposal to develop an opencast mine next door to Bellsdyke hospital. An opt-out proposal is feared in that hospital. Whether or not that suceeds I cannot think of anything more detrimental to the mental health of its patients, who, instead of looking on to beautiful green fields, as they do now, which might give them some enlightenment, will have to look on to a big slag heap from an opencast mine. That will happen if the Minister does not give enough money to local health boards to run the health service and if he pressurises the boards to sell off their assets, including mineral assests. The Minister has not given a thought to the prime responsibility of a health board, which is to looked after the health of patients and the people in the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At best, the proposals will be a leap in the dark. At worst—at least in the case of the RSNH—they will be an attack on the basic rights of mentally handicapped patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
The regulations lay down a consultation period of three months. Paragraph (3) is headed "Persons to be consulted". It does not mention Members of Parliament. It mentions local authonties, but only those in the area in which a hospital is located. The catchment area of RSNH is nationwide. I suspect that the regulations will form the basis for phoney consultations. For genuine consultations to occur, the Minister would be obliged to accept the wishes of the majority of people who are involved. If he did that, the opt-out proposals would be rejected. They would be strongly rejected in the case of RSNH, which would be in the interests of its mentally handicapped patients and their relatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Foulkes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words, partly because two of the hospitals in the South Ayrshire NHS trust application are in my constituency—Ballochmyle and the new Ayr hospital—and, as may be fairly obvious, partly because I am a recent consumer of the services of the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) said: the Ayrshire and Arran health board has fatally compromised its neutrality by various actions. The general manager and the chairman—Jim Eckford and Bill Fyfe—appeared at the press conference called for the launch of the trust application. I know what my hon. Friend the Member Falkirk, East (Mr. Ewing) said about Jim Eckford—he may have come under the Svengali influence of Bill Fyfe since he moved to Ayrshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bill Fyfe has even approached individuals in Ayrshire, asking them to become members of the NHS trust. How can he get away with that when he is chairman of the health board? Worse, he has even used health board premises for his task—for the promotion of NHS trusts. I and other colleagues were there and saw Mr. McNeill, who has a dual role: he is still working for the health board yet he is actively promoting opting out. That is an unbelievable situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Still another irony is the fact that the public relations officer for the board, Michael Kelly, used to be Labour chief provost of Glasgow. That shows what can happen when someone gets on to the board of Celtic football club. He is also the PR officer for the opt-out trust. Furthermore, Mr. Fyfe and Mr. Eckford—like others mentioned in connection with Foresterhill—have publicly supported the concept of opted-out hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where did the initiative come from initially? I suspect that the Minister was behind it. When the proposals reach him, it will be no surprise if he approves them as he was responsible for initiating them. The vast majority of people in south Ayrshire are against the proposals. That includes consultants: the vote went 50 to nine against opting out; and, of the nine who voted for it, five said that they would go along with the majority. That leaves only four consultants out of 50 who want to opt out? Who are they? One of them is Douglas Brown, a 60-year-old orthopaedic surgeon. The Minister says that he is very well respected. I am sure that he is, but what about the others? Are not they also highly respected? Mr. Brown had much to gain from opting out. Another was Mr. Pat McNally, well known as an activist working for the Tory party locally. So much for the supporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider who were against the proposals—general practitioners, local councils, medical and para-medical staff in the hospital. The only people actively promoting it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V007P0I0260">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
are two self-appointed spokesmen, Douglas Brown and Mr. McNeill. It is appalling that two such arrogant people can promote trust status—especially for the beautiful new hospital in Ayr—and seek to have hospitals taken out of health board control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know the Minister's track record. He claims that hospitals will remain under the NHS. Yet we know his track record on schools and other vitally important institutions, and we recognise that once he has moved one step he will take another. We are all too familiar with the Minister's Machiavellian ways; and we know, too, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) said, about his hidden agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also virtually admitted that he would pay little attention to the outcome of consultations. I do pay attention to what consultants say—indeed, some of my best friends are consultants. I know that many of them are dedicated. Many of the consultants in south Ayrshire voted against opting out despite the fact that they would benefit personally from it. That is because they believe that it is against the interests of their patients. I greatly respect them for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opting out is a distraction from the effective running of hospitals. The Ayr hospital in south Ayrshire is late because Mr. McNeill is spending all his time promoting opting out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
