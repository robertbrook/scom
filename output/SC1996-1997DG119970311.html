	<div class='legislation'>Draft Courses for Drink-Drive Offenders (Experimental Period) Order 1997</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Transport in London (Mr. John Bowis)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Courses for Drink-Drive Offenders (Experimental Period) Order 1997.</p></blockquote>
The order concerns an experimental scheme to provide an incentive for drink-drive offenders to attend courses to persuade them not to re-offend. The incentive is that, if they complete the course satisfactorily, the court that referred them to it will reduce their period of disqualification by up to 25 per cent. Only certain magistrates and sheriffs courts are involved in the process and the courses must be approved by the Secretary of State for Transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order extends the duration of the experiment by two years until the end of 1999. Parliament will have a further opportunity before that date to decide whether to make the legislation permanent. The experimental powers were introduced under the Road Traffic Act 1991. Referrals can be made only if the offender is more than 17 years of age, willing to be referred and willing to pay the course fee. At the end of the course, the organiser must issue either a certificate of completion or a notice of non-completion, which can be appealed against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 31 of the 1991 Act provided that the experiment, which must be limited to designated areas, would last until the end of 1997, or such later date as specified by order. It also contains a power to remove the time restriction altogether. At present, the courses are available in 23 court areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rehabilitation courses will ultimately be judged a success if they prevent people from re-offending. The Transport Research Laboratory's latest evaluative report on the scheme showed that, after a period of 30 months, non-course attendees were three times more likely to re-offend than people who had attended the courses. The trend in reducing re-offending applies even to those in the high-risk offender category who, because of the seriousness of their offences or repeat offences, are thought to present a particular danger to road safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also evidence from questionnaires completed by people who have attended courses that they have helped to improve offenders' knowledge of alcohol and its effects, and of just how few drinks it takes for them to be over the legal drink-drive limit. In that respect, 36 per cent. of people who were interviewed after attending courses considered that they should not drink anything if they wished to be safe to drive, compared with 9 per cent. of those
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
interviewed before attending courses. In addition, the proportion of people who considered that it could be difficult to avoid drinking if they were to have some form of social life dropped from 43 per cent. before courses to 23 per cent. after attending courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current experiment relates to England, Wales and Scotland. A Northern Ireland order that was approved last year provides for a similar experiment in the Province, but that has still to be set up. In mainland Great Britain, about 500 courses have been run so far, involving more than 5,000 offenders and 23 approved course organisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An extension of two years would give us a more precise picture of the benefits of the scheme and the continuing change in behaviour. Extending the period will provide further opportunities, too, and we hope to use the next phase to extend the geographical spread of courses by designating further court areas, thus making the courses available to a larger number of drink-drive offenders and allowing for further providers of courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rehabilitation courses, together with the existing tough penalties, rigorous enforcement and our ongoing publicity campaigns, can play an important part in our efforts to reduce the number of casualties caused by drink-drive accidents. We should not lose sight of the fact that every drink-drive accident is avoidable. Although there has been a significant fall in fatalities caused by drink driving over the past 10 years, it is anathema to many of the families of drink-drive victims for us to talk about success in that area. There remains a hard core of people who are prepared to break the law and put themselves and others at risk of death or serious injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must continue to deploy all effective means at our disposal to reduce drinking and driving. Bearing that in mind and the impressive preliminary results to which I have alluded, I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.35 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party wishes to review drink-drive legislation to reduce the present limit of alcohol per litre of blood from 80 mg to 50 mg. However, Labour supports the objective of rehabilitating offenders and has no objection to the experiment being extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation necessary to set up the drink-drive courses was passed in 1992. The Government have therefore had five years to run the experiment, yet most of the offenders to have attended the course have done so only during the past 12 to 18 months. Why was there such an inordinate delay in starting the experiment which has necessitated a two-year extension?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question concerns the methodology of the experiment. In another life, I, like you, Mr. Jones, used to be a teacher—a science teacher. It seems like another life, although it was only five years ago. If I was marking a test on experimental methodology, I would not be overly impressed with the methods used in the drink-driving experiment. We wish to test whether a course of rehabilitation will alter the behaviour of drink-drive offenders, making them less
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
likely to reoffend. An experiment is set up with a sample population and we want to compare the result of the experiment—whether people reoffend—with a control population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Offenders are given the choice of whether or not to take part in the experiment. If offenders are given a choice but the normal population are not, we will not be comparing like with like. I understand that there is a large drop-out rate among those who start the course, so those who complete the course differ from the normal population in that they choose to go on the course and stick with it. It seems likely that those who complete the course are a little more dedicated to changing their behaviour than the normal population. The experiment does not really compare like with like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two possible ways to change the methodology of the experiment so that like is compared with like. One is to offer no choice, so that everyone in a given area has to attend the course. The other is to offer a choice as now, so that people can opt for the rehabilitation scheme, but those who choose it are divided into two groups, one of which goes for rehabilitation and one of which does not, and those two groups are compared. One would then be comparing two like groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last question concerns the course itself. How was it designed? Was it designed to take account of best practice in other countries, whose schemes were apparently successful?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly agree with the idea of a rehabilitation course, but it should not be considered a soft option. If the experiment is successful, the courses should not be optional but offenders should be required to carry out such courses without the incentive of a shorter period of disqualification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.40 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones) for raising those questions, although he went somewhat beyond the scope of this comparatively short order in stating his preference for reducing the legal limit of alcohol in the blood. That is a matter for another day, although we keep an open mind about it. Research shows that only 2 per cent. of people in serious road accidents—those involving deaths and serious injuries—have a blood alcohol level between 50 and 80 mg, so the reduction that the hon. Gentleman suggests would not affect many extra people. Indeed, a much larger group of people in accidents have a blood alcohol level between 0 to 50 mg. The hon. Gentleman would have to decide how much that smaller amount of alcohol was the contributory factor in the accident and how much other factors were involved. That is a difficult area, about which we have an open mind. The hon. Gentleman says that he wants to consider it in the future, and I have no argument with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no delays. In setting up the scheme, we were required by the legislation to designate the court areas, choose the right mix of geographical areas in terms of size, and so on, and identify, establish and approve the courses to be operated. That allowed the scheme to proceed in such a way that we could make
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
judgments from a reasonable number of people after some 30 months' experience. We want the experiment to continue for a further two years so that there is a more complete picture of how the course has worked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some 5,000 people have been involved in the scheme. There have been drop-outs, but—as anyone who knows about these matters will say and as I found out in my work at the Department of Health—there are a fair number of drop-outs in any scheme to rehabilitate those with alcohol problems. Such people have an erratic lifestyle and their commitment is not always as it should be, which is why it is important that the scheme be voluntary. There are incentives, the biggest of which is to have the disqualification period cut by 25 per cent. The threefold improvement among those who have taken the course compared with those who have not is encouraging. We track both groups so that we can obtain a reasonable comparison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter L. Pike 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Burnley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was not my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central right to say that those who choose to be volunteers are much more likely to benefit from the course, even with the incentive? That means that there is not necessarily a true comparison. I am not against the scheme in principle, but it must involve those who are more likely to benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, that must be right, but it is not a reason for our not encouraging people to volunteer, so that they can prove to themselves and others that they can achieve results. As I said, the figures include people who are at a high risk of offending and those who are persistent, repeat offenders. One might argue that people from both those categories are less likely to apply for or succeed in the course, but it has been shown that such people benefit. The evidence is that the scheme is worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether we had examined schemes in other countries. We looked in particular at evidence from the United States and Germany, which run schemes that are similar but slightly different. The American courses involve both voluntary and mandatory attendance. The German course is voluntary for those who are convicted with blood alcohol levels below 200 mg or two and a half times the legal limit, and is run on a similar lines to our courses, in that offenders are required to bear costs but are offered a reduced period of disqualification as an incentive. We learnt lessons from around the world, but mainly from those two countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central was kind enough to say that he supported the order, so we should let it run for the two years and Parliament must then decide whether to make it permanent. If it does not do so by the end of 1999, the order will lapse. Therefore, Parliament will have an opportunity, based on research, to decide whether the scheme is working and whether to make the measure permanent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.46 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for answering some of those questions, but I want to return to a couple of them. He referred to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
assessments that had been carried out after 30 months and the 5,000 people who had attended courses. What proportion of those who have attended courses are included in the figure for those who have been assessed after 30 months? How many people have re-offended and how many of them have not re-offended?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister referred to the almost inevitability of a high drop-out rate when dealing with people with alcohol problems. Perhaps that would not be so inevitable if failure to complete the course meant that the offender would not get his licence back. Perhaps the court should use the return of the licence as an incentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked whether a self-selecting sample had been taken which was sufficiently different from the normal population that one would expect the group of people who chose to attend and complete such a course to be far less likely to re-offend. The Minister has not answered that point at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.48 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have. I said that the person had to be 17, willing to undertake the course, and pay the fee for the course. It is a self-funded exercise, so it is not a burden on other law-abiding taxpayers. I referred to the commitment in terms of the rehabilitation of people with alcohol problems. Many people will make an early commitment because they feel guilty about what has happened and want to put matters right. They also want to reduce their sentence if they can. However, some find, even with the best will in the world, that they are unable to meet that
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
commitment, and they slip out. That is not surprising; it happens throughout the world of alcohol rehabilitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an incentive, for which the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central asks. If an offender fails to complete the course, he has to serve a longer sentence, so will lose the potential quarter that is taken off by the courts. If the course manager informs the court that the person has not met the requirements, the penalty is reimposed. If the person completes the course, but subsequently re-offends, that information is given to the court, so that it can be taken into account. I believe that that is a reasonable system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have the exact breakdown of the figure of 5,000, as the research has been done not by us but the Transport Research Laboratory, which will continue to evaluate it. When the final decision is made, there will be a full report on the experience. The ratio of 3:1 is its assessment, based on what it believes to be sufficient numbers who reach the 30 month point for it to be valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find it extraordinary that the Minister does not know the number of people who have been evaluated. Is that number 10, 100 or a 1,000? How can the Minister have confidence in the research? He has said that those who have taken part in the course are three times less likely to reoffend, but what is the sample size?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To refer briefly to an analysis of the research, 612 offenders remained on the course for 30 months; 1,445 offenders remained on it for 18 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
