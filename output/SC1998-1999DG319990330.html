	<div class='legislation'>Criminal Legal Aid (Fixed Payments) (Scotland) Regulations 1999</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wallace 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Orkney and Shetland)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Criminal Legal Aid (Fixed Payments) (Scotland) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 491).</p></blockquote>
It is opportune that the Committee has the chance to discuss the provision. Although I do not think that questions of my interests arise, I should declare that I am a non-practising member of the Faculty of Advocates and the parliamentary adviser—unpaid—to the Procurators Fiscal Society for Scotland. However, nothing that I shall say represents the views of either body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions have attracted controversy and debate in the press—and considerable criticism from those who defend people in summary trials. The regulations are fundamentally misconceived, both generally and in detail, and will be detrimental to the administration of justice in rural Scotland, not least in my constituency. I shall refer to other possible ways of reducing the criminal legal aid bill and improving the efficiency of criminal justice in Scotland. I intend also to ask the Government where they intend to go from here if—as seems likely given the balance of membership in the Committee—the regulations are approved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government base the measure on the argument that the criminal legal aid bill is, in an expression that I believe they have used, spiralling out of control. It has been drawn to my attention that the Scottish Legal Aid Board's annual report for 1996–97 shows that the amount spent on criminal legal aid for summary cases was £53.265 million. In 1997–98 that figure had decreased to £52.654 million. Therefore, it is a considerable exaggeration to say that it is spiralling out of control. However, I accept that the sum has risen considerably since the beginning of the decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfair and unrealistic comparisons have been made between the criminal legal aid systems in Scotland and south of the border. South of the border it is possible for accused persons to choose whether to be tried in a magistrates court or before a jury of their peers in the Crown court. Some cases that in England receive a jury trial in the Crown court are of similar seriousness to many that receive summary trial in sheriff courts in Scotland. My information is that in England the legal aid budget for magistrates courts is administered by the Legal Aid Board, while that for the Crown courts is administered by the Lord Chancellor's Department. In view of that, it is difficult to make accurate comparisons. Therefore, the Government's argument that Scotland is getting well out
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
of line is of little merit in backing up attempts to impose measures, such as the regulations, that will prove contrary to the interests of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average figure for summary legal aid in Scotland is £844 a case. The Government are proposing a fixed fee of £500 for most cases, which will represent a shortfall of £344. If the current average figure of £844 is reduced, what are the likely consequences of that? Concern has been expressed that the regulations are financially driven and that, in spite of the rhetoric, insufficient attention has been paid to the interests of accused people who should have access to justice. Indeed, what will be the impact on the quality of representation that they receive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not forget that £844 is not an arbitrary figure arrived at from the arbitrary accounts and fees submitted by solicitors. Every fee that solicitors submit for a summary legal aid case to the Scottish Legal Aid Board will be paid only if certain criteria are met. The work must be "actually and reasonably done" and the fee must be for
	<br><blockquote><p>"outlays and travel and waiting time actually and reasonably undertaken or incurred, due regard being had to economy".</p></blockquote>
They are strict criteria and they must be satisfied before the Scottish Legal Aid Board can make a payment to a solicitor under the current system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If work has been reasonably done, but solicitors are asked to do the same work for a fee of £344 per case less, will the same work be done? Doubts will arise as to whether accused persons will receive the quality of representation in summary cases before sheriff courts that they have received until now. If the Scottish Legal Aid Board thinks that lawyers are getting out of control, it has the power to enforce the criteria that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must assume that a public body subject to public scrutiny will implement the remit that it is given. Therefore, will the Minister tell us whether he is satisfied with the current audit arrangements for the Scottish Legal Aid Board? Does he think that, if there were more stringent auditing, the kind of savings that he proposes to achieve from the regulations could be achieved by more rigorous auditing of the board's work? He must answer that question before he goes down the line of imposing a set of fees that could lead to injustice being done because of inadequate representation. In fact, people may not obtain access to justice at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations have been the subject of detailed discussions. We are grateful to the Law Society of Scotland for the briefing that we have received on these important matters, and many of the proposals were discussed in a tripartite working group involving the Scottish Office, the Scottish Legal Aid Board and the Law Society of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some consideration has been given to the problems of rural areas, and the Minister may mention them. He made a concession when he spoke in the Scottish Grand Committee in February this year, and the regulations now contain a definition of "excluded proceedings". However, the Law Society of Scotland holds the reasonable view that the current definition of "excluded proceedings" does not go far enough. It would like to see the definition extended to apply to circumstances in which an accused person is remanded in custody, to proceedings in which a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0446">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
charge involves a theoretical maximum period of imprisonment of more than six months not counting any bail aggravations, and to occasions on which there are six or more prosecution witnesses. Precognoscing a list of witnesses takes time and adds considerably to the effort of preparation. The regulations take insufficient account of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Summary cases may appear before a sheriff. They may involve child witnesses, other witnesses who might be vulnerable or sex offenders. Such cases often require the greatest sensitivity and their preparation can be especially difficult. Inadequate account is given to that in the definition of the excluded proceedings that would merit a higher fee. Other cases cited by the Law Society of Scotland are those involving foreign or sign language interpretation. They, by their nature, lead to greater difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some clarification of "deferred sentence" is required. Has the strict legal understanding of those words been followed? Does the phrase apply, for instance, to a case in which a sentence has been deferred pending an assessment of the likely behaviour of the convicted person? Another example is of a sentence deferred or a case adjourned because a print-out of the convicted person's driving licence details is required from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in Swansea. In another case, a medical record or report may be needed from a doctor. Clarification is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a technical point. If the summary complaint arises from one set of circumstances, only one fee is payable. A case might involve someone who was in a road accident and was found guilty of committing a road offence, of not being insured and of driving while disqualified. The police might also have found drugs in the car and intended to prosecute for possession and even for intent to supply. Two distinctive types of case would arise, and courts would accept that separate proceedings were necessary. Separate and different preparations would be required. However, as the regulations stand, such a case would qualify for one fixed fee although there could be two separate cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the impact of the regulations on rural areas, not least in the sheriff courts in Kirkwall and Lerwick in my constituency. The Minister has made a concession and allowed an additional £50 in respect of cases to be held in the sheriff courts in Campbeltown, Dunoon, Kirkwall, Lerwick, Lochmaddy, Oban, Portree, Rothesay and Stornoway. There are concerns that other rural courts, such as at Dingwall, Wick and Fort William, are not on that list. It might be interesting to hear the reason for that decision. Even that concession is not sufficient to meet the problems that could arise, especially in the isles and in the Kirkwall and Lerwick sheriff courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter from a solicitor in Kirkwall who has read of the Minister's concession. He points out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to conduct a case in Kirkwall Sheriff Court a Solicitor from, say, Inverness would almost certainly have to come up the night before and in order to get back to Inverness the same day as the case he would have to be away from the Court by 4.00 p.m. at the very latest. You will know better than I do the chances of there being a delay in travelling."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
I can confirm that last point. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The other aspect of this from the mainland practitioner's point of view is that if the trial finishes at lunchtime then there is nothing else he can do until he gets his plane back to Inverness. This is completely dead time. The combination of dead time and travelling time is unlikely to be adequately met by the extra £50 fee so that Solicitors from the mainland will be unlikely to want to take on summary cases in island Courts."</p></blockquote>
One could ask why solicitors from the mainland should want to take on cases in the island courts. There are some good reasons. In a small community, a solicitor from Kirkwall may be unable to represent more than one accused person in cases in which there are multiple accused. A conflict of interest may arise in relation to a client whom he represents on other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not uncommon for solicitors to come from the mainland to represent accused people in Kirkwall and Lerwick sheriff courts. Sixty to 70 per cent, of cases in Lerwick sheriff court are conducted by two solicitors who live furth of Shetland. One comes from Aberdeenshire and the other from Edinburgh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solicitor from Edinburgh is a native of Shetland and comes up regularly to represent accused people in Lerwick sheriff court. He has written me a lengthy letter in which he describes his travelling pattern and in which he says that £50 is totally inadequate to allow him to conduct cases properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That solicitor cannot do the necessary preparation and cannot properly represent accused people. He must take account of the fact that there will be considerable down time in travelling and waiting. Indeed, if a case does not finish on a particular day, he misses his return flight, and must spend another day on Shetland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Should that solicitor and his colleague from Aberdeenshire take the view that such work is no longer worth their while, a serious situation might arise, in which accused people in the isles went unrepresented. Only two practitioners whose homes and main place of business are in Shetland are registered with the Scottish Legal Aid Board under the criminal legal aid scheme. Clearly, they cannot cope with the volume of demand for their services, and there is a danger that people may not get their rights to proper representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may lead to interesting cases in respect of the Human Rights Act 1998, under which people have a right to proper legal representation. The Government may find that they have to defend cases under the 1998 Act if they put serious financial hurdles in the way of people seeking proper access to legal representation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solicitor who wrote to me gave a graphic illustration of the problem, when he used the example of a taxi driver plying the 25 miles between Lerwick and Sumburgh airport. He said that that taxi driver would not offer his services if he were told that he could not charge more than £5. Similarly, the Government are asking solicitors to conduct cases in ways in which they would almost inevitably sustain a financial loss. So solicitors may decide not to undertake such cases, leaving a vacuum in the provision of legal representation in places such as Orkney and Shetland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are number of ways to address that. When the Scottish Grand Committee met in February, I raised the possibility of introducing pilot schemes on scheduling
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
cases in the sheriff court, thus avoiding every case being called at 10 o'clock. A case involving a client charged with drink-driving may not start until 2 pm, even though it was called at 10 am. So the whole morning is wasted, as the client's solicitor, the police and witnesses must remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Waiting gives the Scottish criminal justice system a bad name and wastes the time of the police, solicitor, the public and—in many cases—the procurator fiscal. Much greater attention should be given to pilot schemes on scheduling cases, perhaps in a rural sheriff court and a busy urban sheriff court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Towards the end of last year, a consultation letter with proposals on scheduling was sent out on behalf of the sheriff's principals, Gordon Nicholson and Edward Bowen. What response did that consultation receive? What is the Government's view on that matter, and what impetus are they giving to such pilot schemes? I suspect that there may be some shrieval or dragging of feet. However, much time, money and good will could be saved by proper timetabling of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another provision that could be given arose out of a report carried out by Professor Frank H. Stephen for the Law Society of Scotland. He suggested that savings could be made if legal aid was front loaded; if one could get legal aid for a person to plead guilty at a pleading diet it might encourage people to plead guilty. At present they plead not guilty because they want to ensure that they will be represented. It is difficult to plead guilty without legal representation. There are obvious concerns there. Savings might well be made if the legal aid rules were changed so that a plea of guilty also attracted legal representation, whereby proper advice could be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Crown could make available to defence agents at an earlier stage a summary of the police case that was presented to the fiscal and any statements from witnesses, it could save a lot of time in having to precognosce witnesses themselves. It would also allow the defence an opportunity to assess the strength of the Crown's case and give advice to plead guilty in circumstances where, at present, at that relatively early stage, they do not know the strength of the Crown's case so a person is advised to plead not guilty and more costs are incurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are therefore practical things that could be done to save money without damaging the administration of justice. I have said that it is likely that the Government will have their way and that the regulations will come to pass. I therefore ask the Minister to consider the detailed points that I have made today on the regulations, particularly on the serious situation that could be developing in the islands areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What steps is the Scottish Office taking to monitor the impact of these proposals once they are implemented? I mentioned the tripartite working group, but it does not have the means or wherewithal to instruct research. It would help if the Minister could tell us that funding will be available for proper and adequate research on the impact of the proposals. Obviously this is the last time that the House will have the opportunity to discuss such matters, because from 1 July they will become the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament. Whoever is in
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
office then, there will still be officials who will carry these things through, and the change should not be an excuse for deferring any monitoring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be welcome if the outcome of monitoring could be made available to the Scottish Parliament at the earliest opportunity so that the issue may be revisited to ensure that the highest quality of representation is given to accused persons in the sheriff court in summary cases in Scotland. Access to justice should not be denied and people accused of offences that can lead to terms of imprisonment must be properly represented in the courts and have their cases properly advocated. That is vital for confidence in the administration of justice in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution, Scottish Office (Mr. Henry McLeish)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first time that I have had the privilege of serving in a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Hood. Obviously I am eternally grateful, and that will be recorded for posterity. As the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) has suggested, this may be the last opportunity to debate issues that are being devolved to the new Parliament. It is on that point mat I should like to give a total reassurance: today the Parliament is taking a fairly bold step forward. It is firm and fair, to use the words of the 1994 Conservative White Paper that flagged up standard fees. We call them fixed fees now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the Committee that we shall want to look carefully at everything that we are implementing. We shall certainly use me tripartite body, which has proved useful in the past. If research is required, it will be funded. Responsibility for it passes to the new Scottish Parliament on 1 July, but I hope that the same spirit will exist there. These are bold and imaginative proposals, but they must be properly and effectively monitored, and all sides, including the Legal Aid Board, the Law Society and the Scottish Office, should have a say. Indeed, it is clear from our discussions that consultation has gone wider than the three members of the body that I have suggested. I give hon. Members a categorical assurance that we shall carefully monitor what is happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With your agreement, Mr. Hood, I shall respond as quickly as I can to the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland, who has made a number of good points, and then speak later in response to the other contributions. However, I want first to explain why the Secretary of State decided to lay the regulations before the House and why we are seeking approval for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legal aid is an essential part of a humane and fair society, as all members of the Committee will agree. It is also essential that the state provide legal representation for those who cannot afford it, as international conventions require. Scotland has a long and honourable tradition of legal aid, and I pay tribute to the solicitors and advocates who provide legal representation and advice under the legal aid arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, legal aid arrangements must be cost-effective and must provide access to justice and quality of such access. Legal aid, like every other source of public funding, must be found from the money for public

services in Scotland. The Government's aim is, therefore, first to access justice in the most effective and quality-driven way possible and, secondly, to have regard to value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The total amount paid out on legal aid is substantial. In the current year, we will spend more than £136 million on legal aid and its administration in Scotland. Within that total, certain elements of legal aid have increased much more rapidly than others. Summary criminal legal aid is the most significant and has been the fastest growing part of the legal aid bill. The total cost of summary criminal legal aid has risen from £16.8 million to £52.6 million over the past 10 years, because the cost of an average case has risen steeply over that period. The average fee paid to a solicitor for a summary criminal case has risen by 65 per cent. in real terms in the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society's own research shows that there has been an annual, real-terms increase in the total cost of criminal legal aid of 9.2 per cent, over the past 17 years. Better control of this expenditure is required if we are to meet our twin objectives of access to justice and value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already taken a number of steps to bring control to criminal legal aid with the implementation of part V of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997. We have introduced the registration of criminal legal aid solicitors, a code of practice for criminal legal aid, new powers of investigation for the Legal Aid Board and a pilot scheme for providing defence lawyers by means of salaried staff—a reference to the Public Defence Solicitors' Office. These changes may taken some time to yield results. For instance, the Public Defence Solicitors' Office is limited by statute to six solicitors and one pilot scheme, which is in Edinburgh. Other steps are now needed to bring control to the legal aid budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason we carried out detailed discussions with the Law Society of Scotland and consulted widely on a scheme for fixed payments for summary criminal legal aid. The scheme is based on a relatively small number of fixed payments for elements of work. It has been suggested that it cannot meet all the varied situations that may arise. There will of necessity be an element of averaging out across cases. For some, the amount of work done will be less than the fixed fee; for others, it will be more. However, we believe that the sum fixed is a fair one. We shall in any case keep it carefully under review in a way that I shall describe later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our consultation was extensive. I had three productive meetings with the Law Society of Scotland, learning to understand its views on such matters, and two interesting meetings with the Glasgow Bar Association, as well as meetings with other interests. We did not rush to implement the new arrangements. Indeed, we are implementing them later than originally planned to allow further discussion of the details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have taken careful account of what has been said in writing and at meetings during the consultation and have made significant changes. First, we increased the core fees for both the sheriff court and district court cases. Secondly, we introduced a special payment for under-21s accused on remand. Thirdly, we increased the amounts
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
available for longer trials and fourthly we introduced a special premium for cases at nine of Scotland's more remote sheriff courts—a point to which I shall return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The president of the Law Society, writing in its journal, said that the society did not particularly like fixed fees, but he acknowledged that we had listened and made changes which significantly improved the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned, we will monitor carefully the effects of the scheme. The tripartite group—consisting of The Scottish Office, the Law Society of Scotland and the Scottish Legal Aid board—will meet regularly to keep the scheme under review. In particular, it will introduce indicators and collect information to check that access to justice and quality of justice are being maintained. We will keep a careful eye on the effect of the arrangements on rural courts. If support services are required, they will be readily forthcoming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the Scottish Legal Aid Board may not be ready for this major change. However, I am confident that it has made all the necessary preparations. In consultation with the Law Society, the necessary forms have been prepared. Information about the details of the scheme has been sent to all solicitors and further information will be provided through the Law Society. Staff training and changes to computer systems have all been carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal briefly with the detailed points raised by the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland. If further clarification is required by the end of our proceedings, I would be pleased to extend the usual courtesies and make any additional information available to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first question was about the criminal justice review. The hon. and learned Gentleman was right to point to inefficiencies and delays in the court system, which I would like tackled. The criminal justice forum examined ways of achieving that and a report will soon be published about making efficiencies in the court system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman asked about consultations on pilots in Edinburgh and Glasgow sheriff courts. There was a 71 per cent. response to the paper which received substantial support from court users. However, most foresaw difficulties and extra work being created by the proposals, particularly those regarding adjournments. Reservations were expressed by the sheriffs and the Crown about loss of flexibility. The Scottish Courts Service will consult further in the light of those responses. The new Parliament and new Executive will be keen for the proposals to go forward—with consultation, constructive dialogue and a partnership approach. That has been and should continue to be the hallmark of the criminal justice system in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to a particular incident whereby a driving offence might turn into a drugs offence. It will be for the Scottish Legal Aid Board to decide, on a case such as that described by the hon. and learned Gentleman, whether to accept two legal aid applications or to pay two fixed payments. I suspect that the board will, as always, adopt a common sense approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[MRS. ROSEMARY MCKENNA 
	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>

	<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman also asked about rural solicitors. I believe that the settlement is fair and I should like to explain to the Committee how the arrangement was reached. We sought views on how to recognise the position of rural solicitors. There will now be an extra payment of £50 for all cases in nine sheriff courts. The formula used to select the courts that would attract additional payments reflected distance and the level of business.</p>

	<p>The 15 sheriff courts in Scotland with the lowest number of persons called to court were identified. Any courts less than 40 miles from the nearest sheriff court which could be reached without a sea crossing were eliminated from the list. That produced a list of courts qualifying for extra payment. They are Campbeltown, Dunoon—where proceedings have taken place in Lochgilphead—Kirkwall, Lerwick, Lochmaddy, Oban, Portree, Rothesay and Stornoway. We intend to keep the list under constant review to ensure that access to justice is maintained.</p>

	<p>I am aware that Inverness solicitors have withdrawn from the duty solicitors' scheme in Wick. That is a matter for them. However, access to justice is being maintained at Wick sheriff court by the addition of local solicitors to the duty solicitors' role.</p>

	<p>We have tried to look at the problem fairly and have reached a solution for the present, but I assure the Committee that I want this matter, in which I have taken a fair amount of interest, to be constantly reviewed. If we have not got it right, I expect the Law Society of Scotland, the tripartite group and hon. Members to make known their views. It is not our intention to limit access to justice or to undermine its quality. That has been the hallmark of my approach. If problems occur, we shall want to look at them. That is one reason that the tripartite group is being established.</p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I elaborated on me position in the islands, and especially Lerwick, where 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, of cases are conducted by solicitors resident outside Shetland. Does the Minister comprehend the point mat I am trying to make about travelling time and having to travel the previous day if witnesses are to be seen, or even just being there in time for the sitting of the court and perhaps having a lot of dead time before getting back? The sum of £50 does not compensate for that down time when a solicitor is unable to do anything else. I am being deliberately specific because the problem is specific, but I am not sure that the Minister has grasped it fully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to raise the specific issue that the hon. and learned Member raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the problems with the two courts. A solicitor would still be paid for the expense of travelling to the sheriff court. An element of waiting time is built into the core fee in all cases so, in our view, there is no need for a separate waiting time payment. But, in the context of my previous comments, if the hon. and learned Gentleman perceives an on-going problem and continuing
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
difficulties, I want to hear about them. I hope that he will accept in the good faith in which I offer this that we shall carefully watch the position regarding the two specific courts. I ask him to be vigilant, as I am sure that he will be, and to respond accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked whether savings could be achieved by more vigorous auditing by SLAB—the Scottish Legal Aid Board. This has been suggested previously. I understand that, in 1996, the Law Society of Scotland and the board participated in a joint exercise to check whether the board was abating accounts properly. Law Society representatives audited accounts and compared their result with the board's. The board was less generous to solicitors than the Law Society, and the latter could not fault the procedures. I appreciate that SLAB'S accounts are currently being investigated and that this may be the reason that the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland alluded to the matter. So far, the investigation has not yielded concrete evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the wider issue, following my discussions with the Law Society I have been able to appreciate its concern. There should always be proper and effective scrutiny when public money is being spent, whatever the purpose. I have told the Law Society that if it comes up with new ideas on how best this can be done I shall willingly consider them. It has been suggested that we consider a standards board to examine the effectiveness of costs paid from the public purse. I should be delighted to explore that with the Law Society through the tripartite group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland raised the issue of the deferred sentence definition. This is intended to cover section 202 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995—as "The Recorder", the document covering definitions which the board has just issued, makes clear for the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned the cost of summary legal aid. The overall cost has reduced, but the main issue is the average cost per case. In 1997–98, it was £844.79; the previous year it was £794—an increase of £50 in each case. It is important to point out that the fixed fee is much less than the current average cost of £844—a point that the hon. and learned Gentleman made. But of course this is an unfair comparison. The average cost of £844, if correct, would include outlays and VAT; it would also include trials, deferred sentences, bail appeals and other items which are paid for separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Sayeed 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid Bedfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to fixed payments, I note that a series of outlays are listed in regulation 4(2). That list is much more narrowly drawn than current practice. Will the Minister explain why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me put the matter into context. There are core payments for fixed fees and additional elements have been included. Excluded proceedings are not covered under the fixed payments regime. They include summary proceedings following a reduction from solemn proceedings, identification parades, solemn criminal proceedings, pleas of insanity, examination of the facts, matters of special urgency, assisted persons in custody or liberated by the police on an undertaking to appear and proceedings under article 177 of the EC Treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0450">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Outlays form the third category with which we are dealing. They are not included within the fixed payment and relate to employment of counsel, witness expenses, expert witnesses and travelling expenses—for example, mileage attending court outwith a solicitor's place of business. Our view is that the regulations contain a fair, not a narrow, interpretation of outlays. Taken together, fixed fees, excluded proceedings and outlays constitute a fair deal for solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to respond positively to the hon. Gentleman's point. Because the new procedures begin on 1 April, we want to monitor closely the effects of every item that will be approved today. Our undertaking is clear. Quality of justice and access to justice are crucial. If the bodies that I have mentioned wish to comment, we shall be willing to consider their suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sayeed</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I pursue the point? I am grateful for the Minister's offer, but does he agree that the list of outlays is more narrowly drawn than current practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, core payments include costs. The regulations are designed to ensure that solicitors do not transfer expenditure from fees to outlays in order to increase the value of their accounts. I am concerned about that, but I have enough faith in the Law Society and in solicitors to believe that they will not do that. However, the matter needs careful examination, so the provision is not too narrowly drawn. It will offer a safeguard, but we shall review it as it develops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Wray 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Baillieston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was there not a court case in Glasgow that involved one of the biggest firms of solicitors in the country, which doubled the figures for its outlays? If it sent for a doctor or other specialist and that cost £100, it would claim £200. It was cleared by the courts, so that is how solicitors make the bulk of their money. There is something a wee bit dishonest about that. I have not met anyone who could milk the golden calf better than the legal profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a true spirit of partnership, I shall refrain from taking up the invitation to go down the road that my hon. Friend has flagged up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other Government Departments, we are aware of the fact that we are spending public funds. I have every faith in the profession, and the plans that we are implementing will allow access to, and equality of, justice. The tripartite group will monitor our proposals properly to ensure that public funds are being used in the most effective manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland will acknowledge that I have tried to respond to all the points that he raised. However, if any points require further answer, I shall write to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Letwin 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Dorset)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether calves—golden or otherwise—can be milked, but we recognise that legal aid expenditure presents a continuing problem on both sides of the border. We also understand that the Minister is trying to do a conscientious
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
job in containing that expenditure. He has admitted, however, that the other side of the scales is represented by the need to ensure that adequate access to justice is provided. That is the balancing act in which we are all engaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland made many seriously conceived points that were based not on partisan politics, but on his own experience and that of other serious bodies, such as the Law Society of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had prepared myself for an onslaught against the Minister, but unfortunately, he has, as so often, been thoroughly reasonable in his responses. He has quite properly assured us that the question that arises from the concerns raised by the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland will be kept under review. That question is whether a fixed fee, which is a blunt instrument, will prove capable of ensuring adequate representation in all circumstances. The hon. and learned Gentleman was concerned about the amount of lawyers' time taken up in travelling to far-flung regions. That is just one example—perhaps an extreme one—of the potential for discrepancy between a fixed available amount and the actual costs to the lawyer that might lead to unwillingness to provide a proper service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Minister has kindly offered to keep matters under review, a few practical issues arise, on which some assurances would also be helpful. Our entire discussion—like many in past months, and, probably, in coming months—has been slightly surreal, because it concerns what will happen under a changed Administration. Alas, none of us knows whether the present party of Government will form the Government of Scotland. It has been rightly pointed out that the Minister's officials will probably be much concerned, in one way or another, with affairs post July. I have a few questions about how the Minister thinks those officials can and should be guided. Should the Minister take up an important position from July, perhaps he will be able to put his assurances into action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, when will the reviews of which the Minister so properly spoke happen? Can we be sure that it will not be five or 10 years—to take an absurd view—after the regulations come into force, before anyone does any serious research and comes up with serious revisions? Does the Minister envisage that within a year—or at most a couple of years—the review will reach conclusions and that at least a first set of changes will be made?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, how will the review be linked to the emerging evidence from the pilot study in Edinburgh of the public defender? I take it that if that study suggests great success, the whole issue of legal aid and its use will come under review in Scotland. It is therefore important that evidence from the pilot study should be made available within the review, to permit a balanced judgment to be made about how to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly—and here I can declare a sort of un-interest, since unlike the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland I have no personal knowledge of the relevant matters—we understand from those who have the appropriate expertise that while the criminal justice forum is a useful body, it operates at a highly macroscopic level,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
because of its very grand composition. We are all aware that while such grand bodies often offer vision they do not always include people who are absolutely au fait with the minutiae of court practice. Such points as the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland made about down time spent by a lawyer in a distant part might not immediately strike the grandees in that forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the review, the pilot study and the forum mesh? In particular, will the Minister provide some assurance that thought has been given to introducing more microscopic operational knowledge into the forum's deliberations, if it is to be involved, as one assumes it will be, in the review?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to detain the Committee further. Our scrutiny of the regulations has been long, useful and, for once, genuine. If the Minister can give us some assurance on those points, we shall rest content.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Robert Smith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a few additional queries for the Minister following the excellent contribution of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said much about scrutinising rural courts, but I hope that he will also look at rural communities. I have been corresponding with him on solicitors in Alford in my constituency. They are automatically at a disadvantage compared with solicitors in the city, because they need one and a half hour's travelling time to get to the court in Aberdeen. If solicitors are to continue to serve the rural community and undertake legal aid work there, I hope that the Minister will take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister used the expression "averaging out". I have a sense of déjà vu. He seems to have fallen into the same trap that the Conservative Government fell into in respect of students travelling to university. They said that, rather than paying the cost of travelling to and from university, they would pay an average to every student. The ones who lived close to their university thought that that was great: they were getting money for nothing. Those who came from far away had to pay extra. Although the Minister has neatly averaged out the system across Scotland—and it all adds up—some solicitors will be on the wrong side of the average and others will be on the right side. I hope that the Minister will address the concerns of all rural communities, not simply those with rural courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm how regulation 5 will work, as deferred sentences often require a wait of more than six months? Will regulation 5(2) allow people to delay putting in a claim until they know the outcome of the deferred sentence? Will the Minister also say whether access to the European Court of Human Rights will be covered by legal aid? If so, will it be covered by a fixed fee or separately on a time-and-line basis? Will decisions of incompatibility that are sought in our courts be covered and, if so, how? On another technical point, when fixed fees come in, if the Committee decides that they will, will there still be a requirement for minute-by-minute time-keeping for those carrying out legal aid work? If so, keeping the statistics may be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I hope that the Minister recognises that the ideas put forward by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland on other log jams in the criminal system may produce more dramatic results not only for legal aid, but for the wider working of the criminal justice system, particularly the waiting time, which is beginning to cause a great deal of frustration among the police and victims of crime. The chaos and confusion in the system perceived by the outside world must also be addressed. That would give people confidence that the Government recognise that the problem is wider than just trying to manage a budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.23 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will take into consideration all the aspects of criminal legal aid. Does any member of the Committee think that the only money a lawyer gets is when somebody goes up before the court? We must take into account how much a criminal may pay a lawyer under the table when a case is being heard. It is not just £50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was always the problem of the ethics of advertising. A person like Ross Harper does not have one person before a court and, at the nod of the head, in one minute he has £50; he may have £20; and neither he nor any member of his firm may appear in court himself. He may hire an agency, which is paid, and he is paid as well. He may send a wee member of staff out to do the precognitions, but when the bill arrives it has a lawyer's fee on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those matters should be taken into consideration, especially the outlays themselves. What smart lawyer is not going to take the chance to get a double dunt and get £50 for telling a client he knows to be guilty to plead not guilty and another £50 when he is up again and pleads guilty? All that must be looked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the crimes that have been committed stagnate in the legal aid treble? One needs to be a musician to try to figure that out. The Minister must look at this carefully. The legal system is not run like a monastery. A lot of corners and crannies have to be looked into to know how the system is milked. Do they have to declare how much they get from the client as well as what they get in legal aid? Is there something unscrupulous about charging the taxpayer and also getting paid by the client? If I was a bricker plumbing in a bathroom suite I would be paid only once, not twice, that should be the situation with legal aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Eleanor Laing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Epping Forest)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself unusually in agreement with most of what the hon. Member for Glasgow, Baillieston (Mr. Wray) has just said. He displayed tremendous practical knowledge. I also agree with much of what the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir R. Smith) said, although that is not quite so unusual. He is right to point out the difficulties of dealing with averages and the dangers of an obsession with statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was told last week about a medical practitioner in an eastern European country which was obsessed with statistics who came into the ward one morning to look at his patients and, being in rather a hurry, asked the nurse
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0452">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
to give him the average temperature of all the patients on the ward. It does not take much to work out how useful a statistic that would be. I am sure that the Minister would not apply the regulations before us in such a broad-brush way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister undertake to take into consideration, during the period of the review and when its results are considered, the financial effect on the legal aid bill and the taxpayer of dealing with the alleged miscarriages of justice that will inevitably arise? Under the system there will be rather more unrepresented accused appearing in court because there is a financial disincentive for solicitors to take certain complex cases. Therefore more people who go into court on their own without any solicitor and are found guilty will want to appeal, probably quite rightly. The costs of the appeal and the costs to the legal aid bill and to the taxpayer and the costs in court time of such appeals are likely to be greater than the initial cost of providing legal representation would have been. We cannot guess that outcome, but will the Minister undertake to take that into account when considering the review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Davidson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Pollok)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister to look at what this tells us about the legal profession and the way that it operates. I start with the paper that has been helpfully circulated by the Glasgow Bar Association and the report by Professor Frank Stephen. He tells us that smaller firms are more dependent on summary legal aid work than large firms and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"On average sole practitioners rely on Summary Legal Aid for 60 per cent, to 80 per cent, of their income; firms with 2–5 lawyers rely on it for between one third and one half of their income."</p></blockquote>
I am concerned about the creation of a dependency culture. Has the Minister considered simply employing these lawyers directly? They obviously depend on the state for the vast majority of their income. They would not survive in work without it. Will the Minister also consider whether there are tax and national insurance reasons why members of the legal profession would wish to be self-employed rather than work for the state?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us here will be aware of the way in which the Government have moved to stop abuses of self-employed status in the building industry—the abuse of 714 certificates, for example. A similar process may result from these proposals. The Government will benefit in terms of costs when lawyers are employed directly as opposed to having to rely on individual dollops of legal aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the public defender pilot study was designed precisely to address that? Should not the Minister wait until the results of the scheme, which began at the end of 1998, have been published?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I am strongly in favour of the public defender system and I recall how bitterly it was opposed by the profession. At the time, though, the profession did not tell us that sole practitioners were receiving on average between 60 per cent, and 80 per cent, of their income from the legal aid system. Had we known
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
that at the time, we might well have argued more strongly for the scheme to be extended more widely. Sixty to 80 per cent, is a wide average, so I presume that some legal aid workers drew up to 100 per cent, of their income from the legal aid scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to ask about standards of audit by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. I remember in previous debates about the legal system in Scotland how shocked I and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) were when we met the Glasgow Bar Association privately to discuss abuses and were told that it knew who the rascals who were abusing the legal system were, but had not communicated that information to the Scottish Legal Aid Board or anyone else in order for action to be taken. That is no different from defrauding social security and I hope that the Minister will seek assistance to identify those who are milking the system unfairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland said that the scheme could work only if the criminal justice system were geared for efficiency. I take that as its last call for the system to be so geared. Everyone in contact with the legal system recognises that it is producer-dominated. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity, in the new Scottish Parliament, to end the domination of producers in the law and ensure that it is run for the benefit of those who go through the system and the community at large rather than for the benefit of those who work in it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Minister for his grasp of the subject and for his work over the past couple of years in the legal and criminal justice system in Scotland. There are different ways of approaching the Scottish system and some aspects of it could be relevant and applicable to the rest of the UK, though I am unhappy with other aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Averaging out is important. The apocryphal story told by my hon. Friend the Member for Baillieston probably relates to another story that caused many laughs among the profession. There is a ticker-tape procession in heaven and the oldest man ever to come to heaven is there. How do we know how old he was? He was a lawyer who added up all his charge-outs to his clients and turned out to be 160 years old. That got a laugh even from the legal profession. That joke is going around people who feel that they are not well represented or are paying too much for the service that they receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I met members of the Falkirk Bar Association and was not wholly convinced by their arguments. Cases represented by lawyers from a practice with many clients tended to go to district and summary courts. With 10 or 12 clients to represent, they could make a good living out of it. However, for lawyers with a smaller client base, as confirmed by the Glasgow Bar Association, it is more of a struggle to make a decent living from fixed-fee court work. So averaging out does not apply only to rural and urban practices, but will ensure that solicitors who wish to remain in small practices and deal with clients in a more personal way will not be penalised. Those solicitors have a choice: they can increase the size of their practices and give less time and attention to individual clients, or they can get out of the business and take on more lucrative work.

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
I hope that the Minister will address the matter of averaging out, so that smaller firms are encouraged to remain and provide a more personal service. Clients benefit from such firms in small townships and rural areas. The corollary of that may be a downside for larger firms, who may find taking on fewer clients less lucrative. Bunching up and processing large numbers of people will not make clients feel they have been well treated and will not make firms believe that they are getting value from the legal aid system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly summarise the points made in our useful debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members from all parties have raised the matter of averaging. As the hon. Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty) said, it is not only a question of rural and urban matters. Averaging may impact on solicitors' firms with fewer practitioners, and that should be considered in the review promised by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Baillieston mentioned £50 under the table and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok (Mr. Davidson) spoke about representations that he had made about—to put it mildly-irregular practices. Hon. Members do not have to go far to find members of the Law Society of Scotland, which is responsible for policing the profession and may well be interested in details of such practices. The legal profession does no good at all if irregular payments are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are you really so naive that you do not know that that is done thing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not intend to address me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wallace</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should the hon. Gentleman have evidence of what is going on, not a million miles away are people who would be interested to hear the details of such allegations. Underhand payments are wrong and no one would wish to defend them. However, there are ways of tackling the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Minister's assurance that there will be proper monitoring and, if necessary, funding for research. I also look forward to his response to the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin), who asked how the tripartite working group will mesh together to ensure proper monitoring and a prompt response to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's point about sheriff courts in my constituency, and I will ask solicitors practising in those courts to keep me informed about the impact of the measures. I will alert the Scottish Office, should my concerns materialise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"The Recorder" is available to Committee members and has confirmed what the Minister said about deferred sentenced being covered by section 202 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. However, I am reliably informed that deferred sentences arise under sections 201 and 203 of the Act. I am sure that the Minister will be delighted to tell me whether those sentences are also covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
Finally, I welcome the Minister's assurance that the Government will pursue pilot schemes on scheduling cases in sheriff courts. That is a practical way forward which will help the legal profession, the police and ordinary members of the public who go to court and get a bad impression when they have to sit around all day. The Government appear to want to move the pilots along, albeit in consultation. We wait with considerable interest to see how me issue develops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spoken of my deep concerns. The Minister has gone some way to assure us that if they are justified he will deal with them at some future date. Meanwhile, it is important for us to recognise that miscarriages of justice could occur and that that would not reflect well on the regulations. However, I welcome the Minister's commitment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.40 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that, if an hon. Member makes a point and I do not hear feverish scribbling to my left, I shall have to write a reply. So I take the last point made by the hon. and learned Member about deferred sentences. We have section 202 covered, but if there are others we will deliver. We may be ale to do so before I finished my speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman made an important point that was reinforced by my hon Friends the Members for Falkirk, East, for Baillieston and for Pollok. It relates to the value for money approach that requires a tough auditing regime. I subscribe to that. In the process of examining legal aid—we now have registration of criminal legal aid solicitors and a code of practice for criminal legal aid—we set up the tripartite group to monitor and to oversee, and we may need to strengthen it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society has also talked about standards. I entirely agree with the society that want, not only access to justice, quality of justice and value for money, but the highest possible standards. We are keen to develop the Law Society's ideas to examine whether we can improve the standard, and if the society has more to say, I shall be interested to hear it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the auditing side, as members of the Committee rightly said, public money should be audited effectively. I know from my discussions that the Scottish Legal Aid Board is mindful of that. I hope that these matters will be looked at closely in the coming months and that a strengthening of auditing procedures will result. To interrupt my train of thought, as regards sections 201 and 203, although my understanding is that both involve deferral for a short time for reports, deferrals do not attract the additional payment. If I am wrong, I shall write to the hon. and learned Member for Orkney and Shetland, which I have agreed to do anyway. We need to be increasingly vigilant on auditing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Dorset raised three matters, the first of which was the review. It will be on-going, with the tripartite group meeting in May. We do not want to leave it for a year, or two, and then report back. Monitoring should be continuous so that as the year progresses we can build a bank of information, knowledge and research. If changes are needed, they will be considered as they arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0454">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Secondly, there is a link with the public defender pilot in the sense that the tripartite group that will oversee the fixed payments is the same group that will oversee the public defender pilot. In that sense, the Law Society, the Legal Aid Board and the Scottish Office are involved. I should like to think that, although the report is not required for three years—as Parliament laid down—information will be coming in from the public defender, especially on benchmarking. We are talking about controls, and one reason for setting up the pilot was to ensure that we had some information on cost that could be discussed within the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the hon. Member for West Dorset spoke about the criminal justice forum. We inherited it from the Conservatives. I think that it is an excellent idea, and we should like it to develop further. I am conscious that, as the hon. Gentleman said, it deals with macro legal issues and that many worthy people are involved, which is not a bad thing in itself. We also want to examine whether many of these reports might be presented in a form that could eventually be circulated to a wider public for debate. One report relates to efficiency in court. The forum has agreed to handle this report and we hope that it will go into the public arena for discussion in the not too distant future. I want the forum to be strengthened, and to be more representative. It is doing a very good job, but I take the Hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine made a fair point. We are talking about rural courts and communities. My intention is for access to justice to be as uniform across Scotland as it can be given the physical, geographical and other constraints. We want to know of specific concerns that we need to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was asked about claims awaiting the outcome of a deferred sentence. Solicitors will not need to defer their claims until after the deferred sentence hearing: they can claim at the conclusion of the case and submit a supplementary account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question was asked about fixed payments covering cases taken to the European Court of Human Rights. The answer is no—it is not intended that fixed payments will cover such cases. References under the Scotland Act 1998 will become excluded proceedings and will not be covered by fixed payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine raised in general terms the question of personal time recording. I hope that the board will consult soon about changes to the code of practice involving personal time recording. When I last met representatives of the Law Society of Scotland, I learned that substantial work had been involved in studying that question. There is no point in having fixed payments in the same regime that covers personal time recording. Once the board has consulted, I hope that we will be able to reduce significantly the requirement for personal time recording for the new fixed fee cases. That will be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several hon. Members have raised the problem of time wasting in court. We want to tackle that problem. Not only solicitors waste time in court—the police and the public do as well. Several concerns must be dealt with, and I hope that some of them will be tackled by the criminal justice forum and that the political parties will
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
sign up to changes. Limiting the time wasted in court is a commonsense issue. No partisan feelings should divide us on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing) made a point about miscarriages of justice. We are not setting up a system that will add to the regulations covering such cases. Appeals are not covered by fixed payment and we will certainly monitor the extent and outcome of appeals under the new set-up. We are concerned to ensure access to justice, and will also monitor the incidence of unrepresented accused. We shall have to ascertain whether non-representation is due to fixed payment or to other factors. By monitoring the fixed payment system, we will monitor the whole legal system. If it is presumed that an adverse effect is created by fixed payments, that will have to be looked into. We shall also have to examine other contributory causal factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Pollok, for Ballieston and for Falkirk, East commented on the legal profession. My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East made a point about small firms. We seek not only to have geographical coverage but to ensure that there is no discrimination against firms of a particular size. That has been a matter for debate, and I shall keep it under review. The objective is to have diversity and to allow small firms to continue doing an excellent job, not to cut back or to undermine those firms' efforts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When firms take on a block of clients, individual clients may get less representation. In the long term, a system should be examined in which, if firms take on large blocks of clients, they receive less money for each individual. That would encourage firms to take on smaller blocks of clients who could receive more individual treatment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Such concerns about the number of cases taken on by large and small firms have been raised in the wider discussion with concerned bodies. I can assure my hon. Friend that his points will be taken into account in future discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pollok raised the question of the public defender pilot, and asked whether we had plans to examine the case load of particular solicitor firms and seek to extend the scheme. The answer is no. We have an important pilot that has not been wholeheartedly and enthusiastically embraced by everyone, but it is now up and running. We are monitoring it, and it will run for three years before a report is made, not to the House, as I was going to say, but to the Mound Parliament, which will then be at Holyrood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that the pilot is working and to review it. We have no plans to extend either the public defender pilot or direct payment from the Scottish Legal Aid Board. However, we hope that firms will recognise that, although a substantial sum of money is involved with legal aid, they must work closely with clients. That balance must be borne in mind, so that a firm of solicitors is not undermined because of its propensity to do legal aid work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have covered most of the points that were raised. If any hon. Member who wants to raise a particular issue writes to the Department, I am sure that we shall be able to deal with it.

I hope that the regulations will be supported and that they herald a new era in the Scottish legal system. Their operation will be closely monitored by all concerned to make sure that they work and that we improve access to justice and achieve value for money for the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
