	<div class='member'>Mr. Brian Wilson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cunninghame, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 58, in page 2, line 29, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(h) the duty to keep under review all matters relating to the provision, development and improvement of facilities for the enjoyment of the natural heritage and the need to secure access for the purposes of open air recreation, and to encourage, assist, or promote the implementation of any proposals with respect to the enjoyment of the natural heritage, being proposals which SNH consider to be suitable.".</p></blockquote>
After Tuesday's proceedings, I am not sure that any of our amendments will be agreed to. The most exceptionable notion in our amendment No. 4 was the idea of giving Scottish Natural Heritage an educational remit. As the Minister could not accept that, I am in trepidation about expecting him to accept anything designed to improve and strengthen the work of that new agency. However, we plough on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 58 has the advantage of being widely drawn. It does not concentrate exclusively on access, although I shall refer to that. It takes a wide sweep, embodying the idea that the new agency should, in general, encourage as many as possible of our fellow citizens to take advantage of Scotland's natural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is meant to embody what I regard as the present role of the Countryside Commission for Scotland as distinct from that of the Nature Conservancy Council for Scotland. The Bill places too much emphasis on the scientific aspect of conservation and the environment, and not enough on leisure and recreation—the idea of getting people out into the countryside to enjoy it. It is a matter of emphasis. Although nothing in the Bill precludes those aims, stating them in the Bill will upgrade their significance, and responsibility for promoting them will fall on SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am encouraged to believe that the Minister might find the idea acceptable. In a previous debate, when we were talking exclusively about access, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The amendment would highlight access at the expense of other aspects of SNH's purpose of facilitating enjoyment of the natrual heritage."—[
	<i>Official Report, First Scottish Standing Committee,</i> 19 February 1991; c.24.]</p></blockquote>
That amendment was too narrowly drawn for the Minister's liking, as it concentrated on access, amendment No. 58 is broadly drawn and includes
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
the aim of encouraging other aspects connected with the enjoyment of the natural heritage. I hope that the Minister will follow the logic of his words, but I am not entirely confident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people are disappointed by the limited references to recreation and public access in the consultation document and, subsequently, in the Bill. There seems to be a disproportionate emphasis on the scientific aspects of conservation, for instance, the ommission of any reference to the growing threat to access in the highlands is surprising. That problem seems to arise from the development of forestry, intensive agricultural development and various other activities that preclude the public use of the countryside. I hope that one of SNH's key objectives will be to safeguard footpaths throughout the farmed and forested lands, of the highlands and lowlands. New powers and resources are clearly needed to ensure that that network can be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed that the consultation document and the Bill do not propose clear land acquisition and management powers for SNH to safeguard landscape and recreational resources. Obviously, it will be difficult for it to operate in an integrated way if its powers are limited to safeguarding natural sites of special scientific interest or those that are similarly defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment can do justice to the past work of the CCS. I believe that we can promote the concept of encouraging people to go into the countryside to learn about it and enjoy its benefits to the full. I dislike the exclusivist tone that often enters such debates. I accept that some people have a particular interest in, or commitment to climbing in the Scottish mountain areas or are interested in other valuable aspects of the rural environment. However, they have a tendency to concentrate on the great threat posed by large numbers visiting the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an exclusiveness in that attitude that I do not like and it was summed up in the other place by Lord Grimond. I am constantly surprised by the role of the Liberal Democrats in this Committee, and those who read the proceedings of the Bill will be struck by the anti-environmental stance that is so often adopted, by Liberal Democrat spokesmen in both Houses. The rhetoric used to promote their green image is seldom matched by their speeches on the Bill. To paraphrase Lord Grimond, he believes that while it is splendid that people should visit our natural heritage and sites of natural beauty, a limit on the numbers, might have to be imposed. He drew a comparison with Notre Dame cathedral which he said had been ruined as a place of worship and he argued that that meant that the number of tourists would have to be reduced. The logic of such comments is that we do not want too many people to visit the Scottish countryside because their very presence will destroy it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That sort of attitude seems to ignore the fact that the Scottish countryside is almost infinite in scale and variety. We live in a very big country, the majority of which is uninhabited. Those who fly over Scotland are aware of just how much of our land mass is uninhabited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The idea of the amendment—I hope that it also applies to the Bill— is not to draw ever more people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
into the Scottish rural equivalent of Notre Dame, but to draw them into the countryside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member should not have his back to the Chair when he is addressing the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Martin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not designed to draw people into a relatively small number of areas, but to promote the concept of access to and use of rural areas and to integrate urban and rural populations to ensure empathy and understanding between them. If the Minister accepted amendment No. 58 it would upgrade the status of what must surely be unexceptionable aims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Calum Macdonald 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Western Isles)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a vital amendment because the Government's reaction to it will show their view of the apparent imbalance between the roles of the former NCC and CCS in the SNH. The clause seeks simply to ensure that certain of the explicit functions of the CCS, as detailed in the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967, are carried forward into SNH. Clause 4 carries forward explicit functions of the NCC into SNH, but there is no equivalent for functions of the CCS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should explain why he feels that it is necessary to detail the nature conservation functions in clause 4, but make hardly any reference to the CCS functions other than a general statement in clause 1 about facilitating the enjoyment of Scotland's natural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The imbalance, is not only in the Bill; it is in the projected make-up of SNH. Is is well known that there will be a considerable imbalance between former NCCS staff and CCS staff in SNH. SNH is expected to have a final staff complement of about 450, of whom only about 70 will be from the CCS. The imbalance of staff numbers and expertise and the status accorded to the responsibilities and duties of the former CCS as reflected in the Bill causes anxiety to everyone who wants SNH to pursue the task of trying to preserve Scotland's biological heritage and facilitating access to and enjoyment and understanding, in the widest sense, of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ramblers Association has kindly given me some figures about the extent to which Scotland's population presently enjoys the countryside. Walking is one of the most popular pastimes. The 1981 Scottish leisure survey showed that frequency of participation in countryside walks is much higher in Scotland than in England. In Scotland, 77 per cent of those who walk participate at least once a month in walks of two miles or more, compared with only 62 per cent in England and Wales. Walking is one of the prime ways in which ordinary Scottish people enjoy Scotland's natural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, walkers in Scotland are not as well served as those who walk in England. A recent survey of walking in Scotland, which was undertaken as part of the Scottish opinion survey of 1990, showed that more than one third of all walkers in Scotland encounter obstructions or difficulties when walking,
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>
which is more than in England. The Rights of Way Act 1990 will take effect in England and Wales, but there is no equivalent legislation for Scotland. There seems to be no urgency on the part of the Government to ensure that walkers in Scotland can enjoy the countryside without obstruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another survey appeared in the book "This Land is Our Land" by Marion Shoard, published in 1987. It tried to compare the number of right of way networks—local footpaths and so on—available to walkers in Scotland and in England, and found that the average path density was much lower in Scotland than in England. Among the counties highlighted as the worst in England was Norfolk. It is a pity that the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) is not in the Room as I am sure that he would be interested to learn that, according to Marion Shoard's survey, Norfolk had a density of only 0.9 miles of path per square mile of land. Even that low density by English standards was considerably higher than the average Scottish density.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the districts studied by Marion Shoard was that of Stirling. It will interest the Minister of State to know that she found that the number of local footpaths there was lower than in the worst of the English counties—only 0.2 miles of path per square mile of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) pointed out, the wide open mountainside is freely available in Scotland, but not everybody can take advantage of the wide open areas. The Scottish leisure survey that I quoted earlier showed that the majority of walks carried out by Scottish residents took place close to their homes—81 per cent of walkers started their walks no more than 10 miles from their homes. Of course, the majority of the population in Scotland lives in urban areas. Although vast tracts of wilderness are available to people in Scotland, it is important that the countryside around towns should be freely accessible to Scottish people, as the Rights of Way Act 1990 attempts to ensure in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will understand the widespread concern that the new agency should have the remit and the powers to ensure that leisure and access are its prime functions, and that it should pursue those goals to enable people in Scotland to enjoy the national heritage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tarn Dalyell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Linlithgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to raise two matters to which the staff at Battleby have drawn attention, as I believe that this is the right part of the Bill to deal with them. I quote from a document submitted by the staff. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For staff of the Commission, there is a further worry. The two-stage process of merger, whereby MCCS exist as a separate body for a year, has left CCS staff with a feeling that we are bystanders, remote from the important embryonic stages of development of the new agency. It is understandable that NCCS would wish to establish a structure capable of adapting to SNH with minimal change, but from the perspective of Commission staff this leaves little opportunity for further change to accommodate CCS functions, and creates the impression that we shall simply be bolted on to, rather than integrated with NCCS."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0072">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
If you will bear with me, Mr. Martin, another relevant point is raised. Paragraph 5 of that document, which the Minister's advisers will have in front of them, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"From the outset, Government has promised that SNH will be given additional resources to those of NCCS and CCS. We welcome the increased resources allocated to NCCS in its first year, yet cannot help but contrast this with the treatment of the Commission in its final year, given that our grant-aid allocation from central government represents a reduction in real terms and staffing restrictions mean that a fifth of our staff are on limited period appointments with no guarantee of employment in SNH."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As I have mentioned before, the hon. Gentleman must be fair to the Committee and must not raise matters that are outwith the scope of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I bow to your judgment, Mr. Martin. I thought that it was within the scope of the amendment. I shall not press the Minister for an answer now, but I hope that he will consider the problems facing the staff of Battleby. I refer him to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the document in his possession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the matters raised in sequence. The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) referred to education. SNH not only can, but will engage in educational activity, which is covered by clause 2(1)(b), so that matter certainly will not be forgotten. The hon. Gentleman asked about the absence of references to access in the consultation paper. We are aware of the need for adequate access and the pressures that such access can cause. We are awaiting the report from the CCS, which is working in consultation with the convention of Scottish Local Authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SNH will undoubtedly have an extremely important role with regard to access. The hon. Gentleman referred to the importance of John Muir and the example that he has established not only in Scotland, but in north America. It is important that SNH has the overall aim of facilitating the enjoyment of our natural heritage. We have made that perfectly clear. I am willing to examine the principle behind the amendment again, although we believe that the matter is already covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about land acquisition powers. Those are covered by clause 2(1)(g), which gives SNH power to acquire land for any of its functions, not just for nature conservation. The hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) raised an important matter and suggested that a geater prominence was given in the Bill to nature conservation than to countryside matters. I do not believe that that is so and I shall explain why. The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) asked whether countryside matters had been bolted on to the Bill. There is no need to refer specifically to countryside functions. The basis of the Bill is to amend, expand and update the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967. Clause 12 of the Bill provides specific access powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nature conservation functions are set out in detail because they are contained in a variety of other
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
legislation. Those provisions need to be carried forward to SNH and clause 4 and schedule 2 provide the most convenient way of doing that in legislative terms. It is a technical drafting matter and does not mean that nature conservation is more important than countryside functions. Both are equally important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that this is the right time to intervene. Does not the Minister feel at least slightly concerned that the Battleby staff believe that the CCS has been bolted on to the Bill? I do not know whether he is right—I suspect that he might be, but should he not give an undertaking to discuss the problems that the staff believe they face?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter. I repeat that I regard countryside matters as being every bit as important as nature conservation. I said that I shall re-examine the issue of access to ensure that that important matter is properly covered. A study is taking place now and a report will be submitted in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware the the CCS is concerned that there should be explicit reference in the Bill to the access and recreation functions which it discharges at present as there are explicit references in the Bill to nature conservation functions. I assume that the root of the CCS's anxiety is that, without explicit reference, the functions would be lost. Assurances were given in another place that that would not be so. As the amendment has resurfaced, I will give the Committee the necessary reassurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are completely satisfied that the general powers in clause 2(1), especially in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (g), give SNH all the powers needed to achieve the aims of the amendment in respect of access and recreation. Therefore, SNH will be able to build on and develop the work that has already been carried out in those areas by the CCS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general aims and purposes of SNH in clause 1 are sufficiently wide to cover access and recreation. Those aims could not be pursued, nor could SNH properly discharge its advisory functions in clause 2(1)(a) and (b), if it did not keep under review all relevant matters. That would include enjoyment of the natural heritage. By the same token, when exercising more specific powers such as grant aid under clause 8, or working up development projects under clause 5, SNH would need to have a broad strategy to enable it to make decisions on individual cases. It would not ignore access and recreation interests when making use of those specific powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of those assurances, I shall re-examine the matter. I hope that the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North will not consider it necessary to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I answered that question when we debated schedule 1.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an article of faith with the people of the CCS that we shall press the amendment to a Division. There is no argument for not including it in the Bill.

It is better to be candid with the Committee. To put it bluntly, I do not know whether the amendment is necessary. The Minister will recognise that it was proposed by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland. From my experience, that organisation is not often wrong and I take seriously any recommendation that it makes. The institution says the amendment would
	<br><blockquote><p>"strengthen SNH's position in ensuring that development in designated areas is of a high standard and is acceptable to SNH. As drafted, Clause 2(2) puts a responsibility on Scottish Natural Heritage, if so requested, to advise the Secretary of State or any general, regional or district planning authority on any matter arising under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, 1972, which affects the Natural Heritage of Scotland. A sub-clause could usefully be added here, by addressing the matter from the opposite point of view and by putting an obligation on the Secretary of State and the same range of local authorities to consult SNH on applications for specified types of development in what are at present designated areas, eg National Scenic areas, National Nature Reserves, SSSIs, Environmentally Sensitive Areas etc."</p></blockquote>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have called the Minister. It is for the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) to make himself known to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) for his comments on the amendment moved on behalf of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concerns, and understand that he wishes to see appropriate controls in place on developments in particular areas, notably national scenic areas and SSSIs. That is already the case in those two types of designations and has operated successfully in both cases. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary. With national scenic areas, that is done by the Secretary of State through the Town and Country Planning (Notification of Applications) (National Scenic Areas) (Scotland) Direction 1987, given under the powers conferred on him by articles 10(8), 11 and 13(2) of the Town and Country Planning (General Development) (Scotland) Order 1981. That direction specifies the particular types of development of which the CCS is to be notified. I trust that they are the type of controls about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of SSSIs, there is a similar administrative structure between local authorities and the NCCS under article 13(1)(9) of the Town and Country Planning (General Development) (Scotland) Order 1981. That requires the planning authority concerned to consult with the NCCS about the development of trunk roads or special roads or related developments, whether proposed or actual, affecting any SSSI. That system is quite adequate to ensure the proper protection of the nature conservation interests of the sites concerned. The arrangements in both cases are quite sufficient and will be carried forward to SNH when it comes into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also explain to the Committee why it is not desirable to accept the terms of the amendment. In the first place, I am sure hon. Members will agree that the phrase "specified types of development" is really not adequate in legislation. I realise that that is probably intended to mean types of development specified by SNH or the Secretary of State. Furthermore, the amendment is flawed in terms of the enactments that it lists. There are no areas of land designated in terms of either the Countryside (Scotland) Act 1967 or the Environmental Protection Act 1990. SSSIs are, of course, designated under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and would be covered by the amendment. National scenic areas would not, as their statutory basis is section 26(2)(C) of the Town and Countryside Planning (Scotland) Act 1972.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee is grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising the matter, but, given my assurances, I hope that he will accept what I have said and withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be sheer pretence to suppose that I could make any sensible judgment on such a reading. I suspect that the Scottish Office which has considered the matter, is probably right. However, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0074">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
add the reservation that we could return to the matter on Report, after the RICS and its lawyers have pored over the Minister's comments. Otherwise, I shall graciously withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Bill, the initiative to seek advice comes from the local authority or central Government. The amendment seeks positive consultation because SNH should play a positive rather than a passive role. I hope that the Minister's assurance means that SNH will be actively consulted by local authorities and central Government. Although the Government control massive land area, local authorities are the natural planning authorities. I hope that the Minister's assurance means that there will be positive consulation in those sensitive areas, which will give SNH a more direct role.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general terms, SNH can give advice to the Secretary of State at any time on any subject of importance to the countryside or to nature conservation. Those consultation procedures are already in place and will be followed. There is nothing, however, to prevent SNH from exercising a positive role in its own priority areas. I am certain that it will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 46, in page 2, line 35, at beginning insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1) Subject to subsection (2) below,".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Government amendment No. 47.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be aware that we have undertaken that SNH should have the same relationship to nature conservation and the Joint Nature Conservancy Committee as the NCC's has at present. The amendments fulfil that undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their effect is to disapply paragraphs (b) to (d) of SNH's balancing duty in relation to the special nature conservation functions described in section 133(2)(b) to (e) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which are carried out not by SNH directly, but through the JNCC. Those functions concern the provision of advice to Government on policies for nature conservation for Great Britain or nature conservation outside Great Britain; the provision of advice and the dissemination of knowledge to any persons about nature conservation; the establishment of common standards throughout Great Britain for the monitoring of and research into nature conservation; and the commissioning of support of research relevant to those matters. The only balancing duty imposed on the NCCS in relation to those functions is one broadly similar to that in
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
paragraph (a)of clause 3, requiring the NCCS to take appropriate account of actual or possible ecological changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should mention that we will bring forward a further amendment on Report to extend that disapplication to the new element in SNH's balancing duty relating to archaeology, which we shall shortly debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who is the accounting officer for the JNCC?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall find out and make the information available as soon as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments will not have any discernible effect on the way in which SNH operates in those areas, but they achieve the important effect of putting SNH's relationship to the JNCC on the same footing as that which now exists with the NCCS, the Nature Conservancy Council for England and the Countryside Commission for Wales. The amendments apply consistency throughout Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked my important question because I happened to see Professor Knill of Nairn on Tuesday, and that is exactly what he wanted to know. Professor Knill is central to the organisation, but he does not know the identity of that accounting officer. Therefore, it is rather important that we should find that out as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamiltion</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now have the answer. The persons concerned are the chief executives of the NCCS, the NCCE and the Countryside Commission for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, that is not the answer. I asked a quite different question. Who is the accounting officer for the JNCC? The honest answer is that those concerned have not yet made up their minds. That is a great problem, not a technical, fastidious one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given the hon. Gentleman the correct answer. The hon. Gentleman is asking about the JNCC, which was created under previous legislation. However, I shall make inquiries to see if there is any further information that I can helpfully give the hon. Gentleman. I shall do that as soon as I am in possession of the most up-to-date facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that we may be absolutely clear, there is no problem about the question that the Minister has answered. The central problem is the JNCC's overall accountability. That is symptomatic of the confusion that is inset geologically into the scheme. I ask the Minister to write to me; I, in turn, will send our exchanges to Professor Knill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 2, line 41, leave out "and" and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(d)the need to conserve sites and landscapes of archaeological or historical interest; and".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0075">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
Clause 3 lays a duty upon SNH in exercising its functions to have regard to a number of other factors that interact with the natural heritage of Scotland. The new paragraph adds to that list the duty to take such account as may be appropriate in the circumstances of the need to conserve sites and landscapes of archaeological or historical interest. I know that the hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) have a keen interest in that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The landscape that we see around us today is obviously the product of a close relationship between man and his environment over many thousands of years. The conservation and protection of the natural landscape and of archaeological records must therefore inevitably proceed in parallel, not least because knowledge and understanding of the one must depend upon an informed view of the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believe it important, therefore, that SNH give due regard to the need to conserve the archaeological record in exercise of its functions; that is the reason for the amendment. It is, of course, true that scheduled monuments and listed buildings already have a statutory protection, but the archaeological record also includes many thousands of ancient monuments not scheduled, archaeological landscapes where a number of smaller archaeological sites may be grouped relatively closely and important historic sites such as battlefields, designed landscapes and gardens of major importance. Sites in that last category were usually constructed to provide a suitable setting for a great house, but in many cases the landscape created is now of more importance than the house itself, and, indeed, in some cases has outlasted the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A wide range of interests responded to our consultation paper "Scotland's Natural Heritage: The Way Ahead", including the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland and the CCS. They consider that a duty of this nature should be introduced into clause 3. I believe that the amendment fully meets those representations and those made by the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our second sitting on 21 February, I promised that the Government would table an amendment as soon as possible on sites of archaeological and historical interest. Amendment No. 62 fulfils that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome this addition to the Bill. SNH will be involved in a fair amount of expense, however, and I hope that account of that will be taken in the budget allocation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Perth and Kinross)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this excellent amendment on behalf of all those who protect the living and, I hope, growing heritage, both natural and built.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the improvement to the Bill and I wish SNH every success. Will the Minister explain the nature of the working relationship between SNH and other bodies such as
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
the National Trust for Scotland or even Government bodies such as the Property Services Agency? As expense will be involved, what extra resources will be given to SNH? In the past many archaeological sites have suffered from a lack of resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The relationship will be cordial and those bodies will work closely on matters of mutual interest. I have no doubt that when that happens the public interest will be served. Resources will be kept under close review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Historic buildings and monuments have had their resources increased enormously in recent years. There is considerable public interest in such places as New Lanark, which was the site of perhaps the biggest cotton mill in western Europe—Robert Owen was one of the industrial revolution's most enlightened people. The work undertaken in such places is of great benefit, not only to tourism but to the Scottish community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Welsh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us how SNH will deal with the problem posed by Trimontium on the borders? One of the most important historical sites in Europe is under threat from modern development. Will SNH act in the long-term interests of the community and of archaeological discoveries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I speak from memory, but I understand that Trimontium involved a planning application and that the route to which conservationists objected was turned down as a result of representations. According to my recollection, the other route for a new road has been under consideration for some time. The representations were fully considered as part of the planning process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SNH is empowered to make representations on any subject if it believes that the interests covered by the Bill are relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to New Lanark and some of us are deeply impressed by what has happened there. In the past year, I took three formidable octogenarians, my former colleague, Peggy Herbison as well as Irene White and Kay Elliot, in my car to see New Lanark and the recent developments. The site is extremely impressive and a credit to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am sure that the chairman of the HBCS would agree about that. The Minister mentioned New Lanark, but I must not be sidetracked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us whether the new wording in the amendment has the approval of his professional advisers who work for the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland? It is important to know the answer to that question. In the capacity of a spy, I went on a visit organised by the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland to the Yetholm valley, which is an important ancient site. I understand only too easily how the Bill could have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0076">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
a great practical effect, one way or the other, on problems that arise. I repeat, does the wording have the approval of the professional staff?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. the senior representative of Historic Scotland, as it will soon be known, confirmed to me last night that he was delighted with the way in which we had acted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the curtilages and landscapes of houses. Will the Bill enable further use to be made of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 to ensure the preservation of landscapes, gardens and estates in the curtilages of buildings, including even those which regrettably, have not been preserved?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that it will be the responsibility of Historic Scotland to protect such sites, but where SNH has an interest they will work closely together and I have no doubt that that will prove successful. Those with responsibility for ancient monuments and buildings are pleased with the amendment and Historic Scotland will find it a useful provision in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I now call amendments Nos. 29 and 10, but, because of the illness of the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), I understand that the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) will move the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry Bellingham 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norfolk, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 29, in Clause 3, page 2, line 42, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(e) in respect of red deer management the views of the Red Deer Commission.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 10, in clause 4, page 3, line 29, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(11) SNH shall take over the functions and duties of the Red Deer Commission as contained in the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) is ill. I understand that he has bronchitis and, for fear that it might turn into something more serious, he has decided to take it easy for a few days. We wish him a speedy recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple amendment which proposes that, in respect of deer management, the views of the Red Deer Commission should be taken into consideration. In other words, we propose specifying the commission in clause 3 as a statutory consultee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we all agree that a proper policy for deer management is extremely important. The Red Deer Commission staff are experts in that regard and I hope that there will be substantial co-operation between SNH, the commission and the farmers and landowners who are involved in the management of red-deer herds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not elaborate on the details of a particular problem in parts of Scotland—the growth of the red-deer herds—but it is serious. In most parts of Scotland
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
landowners and farmers are conscious of parities and the need to manage those herds effectively to control the population and keep it at exactly the right level. In areas along the west coast in particular, however, the numbers of red deer have reached too high a level. That problem has been exacerbated by the amount of afforestation that has taken place. We all know that deer on hills and mountains are easy to control and that stalking brings in much needed revenue to many remote communities. Once the deer come down into more densely wooded areas, the control of the hind population poses great difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In extreme circumstances, statutory culling powers may be necessary and that is where the Red Deer Commission comes in. The obvious way forward is to ensure that it is a statutory consultee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes a little sense, in terms of trying to build up confidence and trust among the different organisations, to give any time to opposition amendment No. 10, which would ensure that the duties of the Red Deer Commission under the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959 are taken over by SNH. That would be a retrograde step, so I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will resist that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend cannot accept amendment No. 29 now, I hope that he can say today whether he will amend sections 5, 6 and 7 of the 1959 Act. We know that there have been some behind-the-scenes moves, so perhaps my hon. Friend can tell us about those consultations. Above all, will he bear in mind the strong representations that were made by the Red Deer Commission, and consider the logic of making it a statutory consultee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most hon. Members, especially Opposition Members, regret deeply that so much of rural Scotland is under deer. Many of us reject as fatuous the argument that deer make a significant contribution to Scotland's economy, when one considers what benefits could obtain from other developments, if a sane structure of land ownership and management was devised for large areas of Scotland. The result of the mismanagement of resources is exemplified by the crisis that everyone acknowledges is caused by the stocking of deer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall postpone my customary generosity towards the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn). I share the regret expressed by the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) that the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) is not able to attend the Committee. I am not referring to just this sitting, because I am sure that it is agreed unanimously that the Committee's work as a whole has lost out because of the hon. Gentleman's absence. We have tremendous respect for his knowledge of, and commitment to, the issues that we are discussing. On Second Reading, he recognised the substantial problems that have been created by the imbalance of the deer population. He said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are too many hinds and far too few stags. We must have a massive hind cull. That is not easy, because the day is short in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0077">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
the highlands, especially in the western highland, and there is little time to go out and shoot hinds in January, or thereabouts, when the stalkers are doing their best. We must work on that."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 February 1991; Vol. 185, c.649.]</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Dumfries called for a massive hind cull. Let us relate that comment to the evidence given to the Select Committee on Agriculture by the Red Deer Commission, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission has repeatedly warned managers of the problems associated with too many deer … and our advice has gone unheeded."</p></blockquote>
Can any of the numerous spokesmen for the landlord fraternity among Conservative Members explain why, in the face of that comment from the Red Deer Commission, its advice has gone unheeded? If the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross wants to intervene, I shall be happy to allow him to do so. Clearly, he does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"More serious problems are associated with the open-hill population, with bad management practices resulting in overpopulation, damage to neighbouring property and the environment. The expansion of this population is resulting in the necessity for expensive deer fencing to protect tree planting over an increasing area, and in the invasion and colonisation of existing plantations, with consequent problems."</p></blockquote>
Not a very cheeful picture is painted by the Select Committee on Agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee added:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The RDC's evidence to the Committee clearly indicated that the present position is unacceptable. Their efforts over many years have produced little sign of any improvement".</p></blockquote>
What an indictment of that relatively small number of people who are supposed to act on the advice and instruction of the Red Deer Commission. In their own economic interests, and to further their selfish, short-term aims, they ignored the commission's advice and instructions, and went on their merry way, until matters reached the point described by the Select Committee report and by the hon. Member for Dumfries. A massive cull is required because of the excessively large herds that there are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is remarkable that no Conservative Members, who so frequently speak for those interests, are prepared to challenge the views of the Select Committee on Agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tayside, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman understands that the herds have increased substantially as a result of three unusually mild winters. That has certainly been the case in my part of the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the conclusion of the Select Committee on Agriculture during the 1989–90 Session. Its report was published on 10 January 1990, which is well within the range of the three mild winters mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I served on that Select Committee, and I signed that report— as did every

Conservative Member who served on it. Evidence was taken the previous year, so the evidence from the commission about the problem of deer numbers relates to the 1980s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. There is no doubt where the blame lies, the report pins it on the bad management practices of the estates, whose income has become dependent on the overproliferation of what they are pleased to call "sport". It is clear that the Red Deer Commission has been unable to control their operations. There is a problem, and we had better identify it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not overlook the many communities—for example, at Bridge of Gaur in Rannoch—whose small and fragile populations depend on their venison industry. It is not simply a question of sport. The established venison industry provides much-required employment and stability in fragile highland communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that. Over the years I have supported experiments in deer farming that could form the basis of a venison industry and provide considerably more employment. Vast acreages of Scotland are given over to deer—not to provide employment or to create a venison industry but because the estates can get money from "sport" and from people whose knowledge of shooting or of proper practices is subordinate to their desire to go back with so many beasts shot. That is possible because there are far to many beasts running about in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Paice 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cambridgeshire, South-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman exposed his complete ignorance of the subject in that one statement. The problem has nothing to do with the number of beasts shot. It has arisen because there is a demand for trophy beasts—the best stags—and nobody has been interested in culling the hinds. It has nothing to do either with numbers creating more targets, as the hon. Gentleman implies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are well aware of the trophy beasts argument, but we cannot escape the fact that the purpose of having so many beasts in the first place is to sustain a general shooting policy. The value of stags is far greater. I do not understand the mentality, although I am sure that Conservative Members comprehend why some foreigners want to return to their countries wielding a set of antlers. That is their business, and their particular hang-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee report concludes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We recommended that, as a matter of priority, the Government ensure that the Red Deer Commission has both the powers and resources necessary to achieve a programmed reduction in the open hill population of red deer to the target figures already identified by them."</p></blockquote>
Within the context of the Bill, we have the chance to do something about that, and we shall listen with interest to the Minister's response.

Handing over the powers in question to SNH may not be the ideal solution, and I noted the hon.

Member for Dumfries' remarks about the NCC's record on deer. It is a pity that he is not here to expand on them. I dislike the suggestion made by Conservative Members that there is a status quo with which we should not interfere, and that, by and large, everything is fine, and that the responsibility for any imbalance in the deer population certainly does not rest with the estates that profit from deer. We reject that as being complacent. The Select Committee bears out what I am saying, and we look forward to the Minister's remarks on the role of the Red Deer Commission in relation to Scotland's natural environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's speech was strong on the bile that he perpetually directs against landowners, and on expressing his desire for a restructuring of land ownership in Scotland, but showed little understanding of the realities. We are not washing our hands of the problem, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, or saying that it has nothing to do with the landowners. We all know that an overpopulation of deer—primarily, hinds—is caused by a relatively small number of landowners who inevitably tend not to be native-born Scots, but who have been brought up in the traditions of the hills. Those landowners have bought estates, but have not practised the culling programmes, that traditional estate owners know are part and parcel of red deer management. We must accept that as a fact of life, but to adopt the hon. Gentleman's suggestion would mean preventing such landowners from having estates—and that would be contrary to the freedoms that we try to espouse in this House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the current situation and the recognition that there is a substantial over-population of hinds—estimates vary, but 50,000 too many is an often-quoted figure—what would be the best way of resolving the problem? The hon. Gentleman was good on describing how the Red Deer Commission has failed, in justifying his amendment to subsume its responsibilities within SNH. Problems have been created not because of the commission's failure, but because its powers are inadequate. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said that there were proposals to extend the commissions's powers to include the culling of deer where they are damaging the natural environment, in addition to the existing powers covering damage to agriculture and forestry. That would be a major and significant development, to which I look forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman be in favour of culling being carried out at the taxpayers' expense or would he prefer the Red Deer Commission to have the powers to enforce deer culling by landowners, especially those who have not lived up to their responsibilities in the past?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know that I am not in favour of anything being done at the taxpayers' expense if it can be avoided. That is part and parcel of my political ethos. At the same time, we must consider the practicalities and I do not pretend to have carefully studied the substantial proposals by the Red Deer Commission to know its
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
views. We must find a way of solving the problem, part of which is the ignorance of some new landowners of the ways of managing deer. We can overcome that by persuading, educating and cajoling them that the best way of sustaining their income from their estates is not the short-term way of killing the best stags and leaving everything else, but to manage their estates in the traditional highland fashion. That would be the best way of solving the problem. I look forward to a Bill being introduced to amend the Red Deer Commission's powers. I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), as it probes the Minister's ambitions on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot support the amendment of the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson). To subsume the Red Deer Commission within the SNH would do nothing to overcome the existing problems and would almost certainly mean that the commission's responsibilities would be subordinated to the much wider scope of SNH. It is far better to have a Red Deer Commission whose powers and responsibilities are clearly defined in law, and we look forward to their extension. It should work as an independent body, but as a statutory consultee of SNH when it proposes a designation or an other activity that would impinge on the red deer population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. We all accept that over-grazing is a huge problem, the consequence of which is environmental damage. The scale of that damage was pointed out years ago by Frank Fraser Darling, whose name has been mentioned several times during our proceedings. What he said then is no less relevant today. The only question the Minister can answer is whether the Government are willing to accept the recommendation of the Select Committee on Agriculture that the commission should have statutory powers to enforce culling levels. If he fails to accept that central recommendation, that will show that no progress is being made on the issue and I shall have to join my hon. Friend in supporting his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief as the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) has put his finger on the problem. However, it is important to highlight the point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross about the small, dependent communities. As my hon. and learned Friend knows, there are a few of those in my constituency. Indeed, there are deer farms in my constituency, too. A combination of many things has led to the problems. Although the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) tried to rubbish what I said, I believe that the mild winters contributed to the numbers of deer and that Chernobyl had an impact on the demand for venison in the marketplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to rubbish what the hon. Gentleman said. Mild winters and Chernobyl were undoubtedly factors in increasing stocks.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0079">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
However, the conclusion is the same: those who own the stocks have failed to manage them. That is what the Select Committee report said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention. We are attempting to arrive at the same point. The Red Deer Commission, understands the management of deer. It requires powers for their culling, which is essential and desirable. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will repeat what I understood to be the Secretary of State's statement of intent, which is that the Government are examining ways of improving the powers of the Red Deer Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, like other members of the Committee, am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro) is not present. His amendment is sensible. It would ensure that the new body was required to consult on the respective management. Surely we could all agree about that. Amendment No. 10 would not be appropriate. We should give people who understand the management of deer and deer resources the power to do their job effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the remarkably contradictory statements of the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson). We are discussing the preservation of the heritage and the fact that we must have control of hill land. What is the hon. Gentleman's fantasy about the use to which the highlands might be put if those vast places, where there are deer, grouse and other wildlife, cease to exist? Does he think that there will be paper mills, foundries and distilleries? To what alternative use does he imagine that they might be put? I understood that the thrust of his argument was to sterilise the countryside. To what use would he put the land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Who will own it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, who will own it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate, but the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) is being premature. As I am not yet the Minister he cannot call on me to answer. However, I greatly look forward to the day, not far away, when a Labour Government will introduce proposals for the proper ownership and management of land in the highlands and islands of Scotland and elsewhere. That is when we shall spell out our proposals for land use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the hon. and learned Gentleman that I had been reading his autobiography. If he would like some reciprocal reading he could look at some of my works. He could also refer to the reports commissioned several years ago by the Highlands and Islands Development Board. It examined two specific areas of the highlands and islands—Strath of Kildonan and the Isle of Mull. Those areas have been greatly cursed by the landlordism, eviction and everything that goes with them, including the massive over-stocking of deer. Both reports provide a precise
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
answer to the question of the hon. and learned Gentleman. The HIDB consultants said exactly what could be done for the economic regeneration of those two difficult areas, which are now bereft of people, but rich in deer. Neither report came to anything because, despite the sanctimonious rubbish talked about local democracy, the only democracy that exists in such places is the power of landowners to frustrate everything that can be done for economic regeneration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last speech was reminiscent of one or two editorials in the 
	<i>West Highland Free Press.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been interesting and my hon. Friends the Members for Cambridgeshire, South-East (Mr. Paice) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir Nicholas Fairbairn) were right to suggest that the livelihoods of many people in fragile communities are at stake. I was made aware of their problems when I was asked by Willie Forbes, head stalker at Mar Lodge, to go hind stalking with him. He made me drag a hind about one mile from the place where he had shot it to the road. One really feels that one has done a stint by the end of something like that. That brought it home to me that that was a hard way of life and that great skills were involved. Many items in museums are made by stalkers, such as Willie Forbes, who is also a taxidermist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what the Under-Secretary says about the hard, physical graft and skill of the people employed in such occupations. Will he tell us how much Willie the stalker was paid and whether he lived in a tied house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I saw the house, which was very nice, and I think that he owned it himself. Scottish Homes is undertaking a report on tied houses, to which we look forward because we want to bring empty Scottish houses back into use as quickly as possible, especially in the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) moved the amendment on behalf of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Monro), to whom I have spoken and whose view is that the Red Deer Commission knows much about deer management, so it should not be weakened in any way. Although the number of deer has increased enormously, there are differences between areas, which make the subject difficult. I have met the Red Deer Commission's chairman and we are committed, not to inaction as the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North suggested, but to reviewing deer legislation. We shall take account of the comments that have been made in the debate. SNH can advise the Red Deer Commission and that is well understood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was prompted to check the report of the Second Reading debate, in which the Secretary of State gave the following firm commitment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In addition to all the provisions that I have mentioned, and as previously indicated, we intend to bring forward amendments in Committee for two purposes. First, we intend to seek

	<span class='label label-info column'>135</span>
amendment to the Deer (Soctland) Act 1959 to allow the Red Deer Commission, where there is damage to the natural heritage, to exercise the same powers that it already has in relation to deer causing damage to farming and forestry."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 February 1991; Vol. 185, c.634.]</p></blockquote>
Does that commitment still stand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman listens as I unfold my remarks he will find that I come to what we consider to be the best way forward in my conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I appreciate the objective of amendment No. 29, which was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West, I cannot commend it to Committee. I do not consider it appropriate to place a statutory duty on SNH to consult the Red Deer Commission in respect of its interests in red deer management. There are two aspects of that. First, there is the management of the estates which SNH will inherit from NCCS. I am aware of the criticisms of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries of the way in which the NCC has managed deer on some estates. Secondly, there is the general interest of SNH in the management of deer and the extent to which they should be controlled or culled in the interests of the wider aspects of the natural heritage. I am satisfied that the imposition of a statutory requirement to consult is not the best way forward. I am confident that a good working relationship will develop between SNH and the Red Deer Commission, and indeed other interests, and that a specific statutory requirement to consult could hinder rather than help the relationship. I understand that the Red Deer Commission is aware of the need for close co-operation with SNH and proposes, once the new body is established, to discuss various options, with a view to implementing the best consultation procedures. That was confirmed by its chairman. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the chairman of the Red Deer Commission against the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes. I pressed the chairman on the matter and he is not in favour of statutory consultation. He is happy with non-statutory consultation and he intends to proceed positively in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More generally, it is not appropriate to list all the specific bodies that should be consulted. That would unduly constrain SNH and some important interests could be omitted. The Committee can be reassured that SNH will be able to advise the Red Deer Commission and that it can seek advice from the commission on the interaction between natural heritage and deer management. Those advisory functions are adequately covered in clause 2(1)(a) and (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10 would merge the Red Deer Commission and SNH. Although our consultation paper raised that possibility, the responses showed that there was no clear consensus on the subject. On further reflection, we decided that it would not be appropriate to merge the two bodies because the remits of the Red Deer Commission and Scottish
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
Natural Heritage are different. The commission is responsible for the management of all species of deer, whereas Scottish Natural Heritage has a responsibility to advise on any activity that affects the natural heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am well aware of the interest of my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North in deer farms, a considerable number of which have been developed in Scotland in recent years. The licensing of venison dealers comes under the remit of the Red Deer Commission and it would not be suitable to incorporate such a responsibility into an organisation that deals primarily with conservation. Scottish Natural Heritage will continue the role of the NCC and will provide one member of the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North said, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of Sate announced on Second Reading that we intended to table an amendment that would allow the Red Deer Commission to reduce the damage to the natural heritage as it can when damage is done to agriculture and forestry. Following consultations with the Red Deer Commission and other interest, it is now clear to me that to amend the powers of the Commission to enable it to deal effectively with such damage would be outside the scope of the Bill. That issue, as our consultations have shown, is far from straightforward. We have reluctantly concluded that it would best be tackled in the wider review of deer legislation, to which we are firmly committed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for stressing that he will reconsider deer legislation, with a view to making the necessary amendments to the Deer (Scotland) Act 1959. I appreciate his argument against listing different statutory consultees. For example, if the clause referred specifically to the Red Deer Commission, as proposed in the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfires (Sir Hector Monro), other organisations might want to be included, too. That could lead to many amendments on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept my hon. Friend's point about the view of the chairman of the Red Deer Commission. I note from the correspondence that was sent to my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries by the commission that its chairman was sympathetic to the amendment, but that after hearing the views of the Scottish Office on the matter, was happy for the amendment, to be withdrawn. I find that encouraging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not find encouraging the attacks made by the hon. Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) on some of the highland estates. I recently read a report by the British Deer Society which estimated that about 5,000 jobs in the highland region were dependent on deer stalking. I am referring to not only deer stalkers, but ghillies and gamekeepers. If it were not for the stalking season that provides them with employment during those months, they would not have a full-time job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also bear in mind the game dealers, garages, shops, hotels and pubs were many visiting stalkers stay. I am not a great deer stalker; I am keener on having a fishing rod in my hand, but I have been on estates where stalking has been taking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0081">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
place. I know how fragile some rural communities are. I also know how much income is generated through stalking. On many estates one can see stalkers from Sweden, Norway, Germany and America, who bring thousands upon thousands of pounds into those communities. They stay in hotels or pubs and use local shops and garages. The equipment on those estates must be properly maintained which also creates jobs. The British Deer Society's estimate of the number of jobs may have been exaggerated, but there are thousands of jobs rather than a few hundred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If stalking is stopped and those large estates are broken up, what employment will replace those jobs? The hon. Member for Cunninghame, North has not answered that question. The report by the Highlands and Islands Development Board suggested, not that those estates should be broken up, but that the owners should be more enterprising and dynamic in their attempts to make better use of their properties for small businesses, craft businesses, encouraging tourism and the like, using the buildings as assets to generate extra income. I accept that some estates in Scotland are badly run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridgeshire, South-East (Mr. Paice) alluded to some estate owners who are irresponsible, but the vast majority of estate owners take pride in their properties and go out of their way to encourage the traditions of the countryside. They are respected by their communities, where it is known that were it not for the income invested in those estates by private owners, those jobs would be jeopardised. The hon. Gentleman must confront that contradiction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for the remarks he made and I shall withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not claim to be an expert on deer stalking, but I should like to hear the Scottish Office view. Is not the truth of the matter that badly run estates are often those in which there is no culling, so far too many deer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to load the Committee with my personal experiences, but I was fortunate to go to the Cota Doñana, the national park in Spain, where deer culling is forbidden. As a result, there are so many deer that they are on the verge of destroying much of the other natural heritage. If SNH is to do its job properly, it must be powerful in its request to the Red Deer Commission to carry out culling or stalking—call the control of numbers what you will, Mr. Martin. If the numbers are not controlled, much of the rest of the natural heritage will be destroyed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Norfolk, North-East (Mr. Bellingham) has set many more hares running, which I shall not pursue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental difference of interpretation. The hon. Gentleman may consider that sporting estates are not the answer to, but the cause of the communities' fragility. Those places have been perverted beyond all recognition by the creation of an economy that has prevented the natural development of rural communities along other lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear about the 5,000 jobs, particularly when the hon. Gentleman linked them to hotels and garages. I sometimes wonder where those famous statistics come from, but they are explicable if they include every hotel and garage in areas where there are few deer. I assure him that there would be more hotels and garages, more life, more happiness and less bloodlust in those parts of Scotland if rural communities were founded not on the shooting of deer but on other more socially useful purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not had a reply from the Minister to the question from the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald). Will the Red Deer Commission be given statutory power to impose what all hon. Members appear to recognise as desirable? We know why it does not have statutory powers. We know why it is different from other quangos and does not have the statutory authority to tell people what to do. It is because the Government are not in the business of telling landowners what they must do. At a push, the Government might ask them nicely, but as we saw from the Select Committee report, the landowners failed to respond. The question then is whether to apply statutory pressure. If the Minister ducks that question, he will be telling us that once again the landed fraternity in Scotland have got away with it. If they are good, kind and generous enough to assist in carrying out Government policy, good and well, but perish the thought that the Scottish Office would have the lèse majesté to tell them that they must act in the wider environmental interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The points raised in another place have been considered further, and I shall report to the Committee the reasons why it is not necessary to amend the clause as certain people in another place wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three issues were suggested for inclusion among the elements in the clause. First, it was argued that "development" in paragraph (c) had the limiting effect of concentrating only on new activites creating change, rather than requiring SNH to take account of existing activities and circumstances. That fails to take into account the general aims and purposes of the conservation and enhancement of the natural heritage set out in clause 1(1). SNH can fulfil those responsibilities only if it takes account of current social and economic circumstances and the existing state of the environment. Accordingly, a reference in clause 3 to the status quo would be redundant. It would also blur what we regard as the proper focus of clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it was suggested that the definition of land uses in paragraph (b) should be extended to cover deer management and field sports. The welfare
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
of wild deer is adequately dealt with in clause 1 as conservation of the fauna of Scotland must, under any definition, include wild deer. We also believe that any interest in the farming of deer would be covered by the general reference to agriculture in clause 3(b) and also by the reference in 3(c) to economic development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recreational sports are adequately covered by SNH's general aim to facilitate the enjoyment of the natural heritage. The economic relevance of field sports, from the point of view of the landowner and others involved in the employment generated by that activity, is covered by "social and economic development" and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the interests of local communities",</p></blockquote>
which we take to include their existing and future social and economic interests.

Finally, on the interests of landholders, it is clear that some consider that the expression "local communities" is limited to rural centres of population, and excludes those living in the country in isolated locations. We believe that that takes too narrow a view of the expression. The dictionary definition of "community" is of a body of people living in the same locality, but that does not necessarily mean that in order to form a community, they must live in an identifiable and defined village. A parish, for example, would presumably be regarded as a community, even though it was made up only of scattered cottages without a real centre of population. The word "community" also connotes some sharing of common interests in such matters as the need for schools, shops, transport, employment, adequate housing and so on. If paragraph (d) were amended to refer specifically to home owners, their tenants and occupiers, that would require SNH to have regard not only to snared community interests, but to the individual interests of each person in the additional categories. We do not believe that that would be desirable.

I know that Members of Parliament are criticised for being unfeeling about deer. People wonder how we can allow such terrible things to happen to such sweet animals. The truth of the matter, as I see it, is that the ecological balance has been upset by the actions of man. The slaughter of the wolves that are the natural predators of the deer is the reason why there are more deer than there should be for the rest of the ecological balance. People who criticise those of us who who seem tough on sweet-looking deer must understand the problems caused by the disturbance of the ecological balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment is part of that process. It would put beyond doubt the ability of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, established under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, to advise SNH on any of its nature conservation functions which, in the committee's opinion, relate to nature conservation for Great Britain as a whole, or nature conservation outside Great Britain.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following: New clause 4—
	<i>Provision of advice in relation to forestry</i>—
	<br><blockquote><p>".—(1) SNH shall advise the Forestry Commissioners upon the location and design of forestry and its effects on the natural heritage of Scotland.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) Where, following advice from SNH, the Forestry Commissioners intend to approve an application for grant aid for forestry planting which, in the opinion of SNH, will be likely to lead to damage to the natural heritage of Scotland, SNH may request, and the Forestry Commissioners shall comply with such requests, that the application is referred to the Secretary of State for decision, and SNH may make such representations as it considers desirable to the Secretary of State.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>New clause 11—
	<i>Forestry licences</i>—
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1)All new forestry planting schemes over a size to be specified by the Secretary of State shall have to be licensed.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>SNH shall issue such licences as it shall approve after consultation with the forestry commissioners and relevant local authorities.".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: New clause 11 and amendment No. 9 are complementary to new clause 4, which deals with forestry development that requires grant aid. New clause 4 sensibly proposes that, before the Forestry Commission issues grant aid, consultation should take place with Scottish Natural Heritage to ensure that the design and location of a proposed plantation confirms with the aims of SNH. New clause 11 and amendment No. 9 would broaden the scope of SNH to encompass not only new plantations that require grant aid, but any new plantation, the size of which can be specified by the Secretary of State in subsequent regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What size does the hon. Gentleman have in mind? Does he concede that SNH would have the right to say what form a plantation should take? For example, could it decide whether it would be "deciduous" or, as it is now called for some extraordinary reason, "broadleaf"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Macdonald</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the objective of the proposals. They would ensure that such input would influence the location, design and composition of new plantations. Under the farm woodland grant scheme, a maximum size of 40 hectares is eligible for a grant. That is fairly small in commercial terms, but it could have a fairly large environmental impact. I would pitch it fairly low.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to argue about the precise threshold—that can be discussed later. I want the principle that all plantations with a potential environmental impact should come under the scrutiny of SNH to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to advance a case put by the Select Committee on Agriculture in its report, "Land Use and Forestry", which was published in 1989–90. I served on the Select Committee, and we understood the Government's argument that most plantations with a potential impact on the environment would come under a grant scheme, and would therefore fall within the remit of the Forestry Commission. Nevertheless, I, and the Select Committee, saw no advantage in leaving a potential loophole through which people could avoid obtaining approval for their particular forestry proposals. We understood from the Forestry Commission that it would involve almost no extra bureaucratic cost to establish the principle of planting licences, which is analogous to the existing principle of felling licences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should prefer a new clause that would give the Forestry Commission, rather than SNH, the power to issue planting licences. SNH could then advise the commission on the licences. However, it is not possible to introduce such a new clause into the Bill, as the Minister discovered when he tried to introduce a new clause affecting the Red Deer Commission. That is why new clause 11 is framed as it is. SNH would issue the licences after consultation with the Forestry Commission and the relevant local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0084">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
The new clause is modest and eminently sensible. It would remove many of the conflicts about forestry that have arisen over the years. People become aggrieved because they find out about a prospective plantation after it has been agreed, rather than during the process of an application for a licence. It would allow applications in principle to take place, and feedback to be gained from SNH about the acceptability of a prospective plantation. Under the present system, a proposal, once it is under way, becomes embroiled in last-minute objections. That causes much dissent and annoyance. The new clause would be simple to implement, and additional administrative costs would be small. It would greatly relieve the conflicts that occur between local authorities, community groups and environmental bodies when forestry planting is undertaken. I hope that the Government will accept the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paice</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak briefly on the general subject and specifically on new clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Severally, issues should be thoroughly examined. First, it is necessary to emphasise the damage that has been done to the reputation and image of forestry in the past few years as a result of what virtually everyone would agree have been pretty insensitive planting practices. Few would defend the blanket afforestation of some of our uplands, but that ignores the major progress made in developing forestry techniques that respect the topography of the areas where it is to be undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not make a political point, but the private sector has been more prominent than the Forestry Commission in developing proper forestry planning through the use of contours and soil testing. Specific varieties of trees are planted on different soil sites and specific areas are left for deer lawns and other natural habitats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, those advances in technique need time to gain public recognition but it is to be hoped that there will be less resistance to further planting. That is why I tabled new clause 4, although it might appear to be an anti-forestry proposal. Those who read about proposals relating to the granting of permission for the planting of more forestry, to which, the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) referred, or about proposals that SNH should be used as a consultee, may believe tha they imply restrictions on forestry. However, that is not the purpose of my new clause. I want to return to previous levels of planting, but not necessarily throughout Scotland. I belive that that is necessary for a range of reasons, not least employment opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the earlier debate about red deer, there was reference to jobs. It is almost beyond dispute that, in all types of agricultural and landscape activities, a mature, rotated forest provides more employment than virtually any other. Certainly, it provides more jobs than pure farming, sport and the rest, so it is important that forestry should redeem itself, especially as some past developments have left much to be desired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that the hon. Member for Western Isles knows that new clause 4 was tabled at the behest of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, of
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
which I am a member. I have a high regard for it as it is an objective and sensible conservation body. It told me that, only last August, the Forestry Commission approved a fairly substantial planting of 873 hectares in Glendye in Grampian. Because the area contained no SSSIs, the NCCS was not consulted at the time. That example represents a loophold in the system that we must try to block and that is the purpose of my new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal to plant was objected to by the NCCS, the Countryside Commission, the RSPB and almost everyone else involved in conservation. However, because they were not statutory consultees, their objections were obviously regarded as having lesser import. Planting went ahead and has had severe effects on the habitats of a range of upland birds including eagles, merlins and waders. If there had been a better relationship between the Forestry Commission and the NCCS and the latter had been consulted, it is possible that, given the modern planting practices to which I referred, a planting pattern could have been devised that would have met the objectives of nearly all of the interested bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister considers the amendment I hope that he will acknowledge that it is essential for foresty to regain its stature as an important industry in this country. We all recognise that there is a need to make substantial changes to the fiscal regime. When my right hon. Friend who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer removed the taxation arrangements for forestry, it was in response to public pressure and I believe that it was endorsed by most people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those arrangements happened to include one or two well-known personalities whose names had been dragged through the press, but it was the perceived effect on the environment that provided the stimulus for public demand to change that tax break. We must now find a way of redeeming the image of forestry and that will probably involve fiscal changes which are not the subject of our debate. I do not pretend to have the wisdom of Solomon or to claim that my new clause is word perfect—probably it is not. However, we must find a way of establishing proper relationships between those who want to plant and to use modern planting practices that can make forestry on hills and below them acceptable in rural areas, and those organisations, including SNH, which have responsibility for the conservation of the landscape, habitats, access and all the other factors that relate to the Scottish hills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can respond positively and assure us that there will be proper consultation. Existing arrangements for consultation are restricted to sites of special scientific interest and other designated areas and they are inadequate. We need wider consultation and we may then see the rebuilding of the reputation of forestry that I desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, South-East (Mr. Paice) said that if the relationship between the Forestry Commission

	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
and the Nature Conservancy Council had been better, much would have flowed from it. I suspect that he knows a great deal about the matter and I heartily endorse the implications of what he said. A good deal of the trouble has arisen because of that state of affairs and, from my vantage point as a constituency Member of Parliament, I have the impression that those differences and frictions have been unnecessary. That is all in the past and there is no purpose in excavating it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise another aspect of the issue with the Scottish Office and the Minister. I refer to the obligations of SNH, if any, in relation to part of the Government's policy on climate change. The subject is linked to forestry. I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister following the appearance of an article written by Mr. Read in the 
	<i>National Westminster Bank Quarterly Review.</i> The Prime Minister's reply, dated 27 December, stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have enclosed a policy note which covers the current UK Government thinking on climate change. Mr. Read's interesting article suggests that forestry provides the solution. Our view is that forestry should be one of a range of policies, all aimed at controlling the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, which should be pursued simultaneously. United Kingdom policy on forestry aims both to contribute to international efforts to conserve and regenerate tropical forests, and to encourage tree-planting in Britain."</p></blockquote>
I was glad that he said that. It is a question not only of UK policy in relation to climate change, but of setting our own house in order, to set an example. I say with total conviction and certainty that if we do nothing, we shall be in no position to tell them what to do in Brazil, Colombia, or wherever else there are humid or semi-tropical forests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our immediate target must be to slow down and eventually reverse the present rate of deforestation before we can think of massive schemes of afforestation. This is important not only in the context of forests as carbon sinks but also their role in hydrology, soil protection and biodiversity. These may in turn bring up questions on the nature of the forests we wish to see. International agreement is needed on forests and we will be working to achieve this in the forthcoming negotiations on a Framework Convention on Climate Change, but the difficulties should not be underestimated."</p></blockquote>
I should be interested to know whether the Scottish Office and the FMH will contribute to that important series of conferences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Apart from the problems of achieving the necessary international consensus, a plan such as that suggested by Mr. Read would raise the problem of disposal of the wood grown so that the carbon is not re-emitted to the atmosphere. Despite this we wish to pursue as many routes as possible in reducing emissions and promoting sinks, and the Government is discussing with the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology the whole issue of carbon sequestration."</p></blockquote>
What is the relationship between SNH and the institute to be? That is not a hypothetical question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that it were possible to read from certain documents, because that would make for better understanding among those who have to read these proceedings in the course of their work. I shall quote only part of the document that the Prime Minister sent with his letter, entitled "UK Policy on Climate Change". The first paragraph states:
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The former Prime Minister announced in May 1990 that, provided other countries played their part, the UK was ready to set itself the demanding target of returning CO
	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions to the 1990 levels by the year 2005. This would be a significant first step in responding to the threat of climate change and would be achieved against the background of a substantial forecast increase in UK energy demand and CO
	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions. It is a realistic and achievable target which will contribute to the international response to climate change without imposing significant damage to the UK economy."</p></blockquote>
Will SNH, in conjunction with the Forestry Commission take that seriously?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second paragraph begins:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Energy Efficiency Office's…programmes to help promote energy efficiency will be stepped up, including the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme aimed at low-income households…and grants to further improve the energy efficiency of buildings".</p></blockquote>
That is all part of the problem of climate change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the SNH contribute to international action, as outlined at the second world climate conference from 6–7 November? I telescoped some of that paper, but I hope that the Scottish Office and the Minister understood the substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that we seem to agree, at least on that issue. I express the notion more in hope than in optimism that that agreement will be reflected when we come to vote on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who is familiar with rural Scotland will know that some terrible blights have been created by unplanned and uncontrolled forestry, where the wrong trees were planted, in the wrong places, for the wrong reasons. Forestry is potentially a great national industry. It is extraordinary that it has developed over the past decade in such a haphazard and laissez-faire manner. A gaping gap exists in the planning procedures, and the controls need to be addressed with legislation. We believe that can be done in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 85 of the report of the Select Committee on Agriculture puts it succinctly. It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"we see no advantage in leaving open a loophole whereby people can avoid having to obtain approval for forestry proposals, particularly at a time when the acceptable standards for forestry are being raised."</p></blockquote>
Surely that is incontrovertible. How can one defend forestry proposals going ahead without democratic accountability or meaningful consultation? Such developments can completely alter the nature of rural areas of great beauty, and inhibit the prospects for small rural communities—about which concern was expressed a short time ago. That should not be possible, yet forestry developments are not subject to planning controls or to more rigorous regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 would give SNH the role of primary consultee in all cases where forestry developments are proposed. That could be an important step forward in ensuring proper levels of consultation. At present, the Countryside Commission and the Nature Conservancy Council are consulted only in specific geographic areas, such as sites of special scientific interest, national nature reserves, environmentally sensitive areas, and national scenic areas. As the hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, South-East (Mr. Paice) said, it is unsatisfactory that outside those areas, secondary consultees must rely on local authorities to notify them of any proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1990-1991V006P0I0086">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
Worries about how the procedures would work include poor communications, secretiveness, and an assumption that a lack of complaints is a sign of success rather than of a failure to consult with all interested parties. That is history. It is widely recognised to be an unsatisfactory state of affairs. The physical evidence of bad planning and lack of controls in forestry development will have to be lived with for many decades to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What can be done? The aim is to ensure the minimum damage to areas of high conservation value, and maximum conservation benefit for the farm woodland grant scheme, and to be aware of the stage that applications have reached. Those are the minimum criteria for what could be described as a democratic, accountable process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal that I make, which, comes directly from the World Wide Fund for Nature's Scottish office in Aberfeldy, is for a felling licence gazette to be published. Each forestry district would list all planting and felling applications, including those in the Forestry Commission's estates. That document would be circulated to local authorities, other statutory consultees—including SNH—and other relevant bodies or individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is alo recommended that the Secretary of State should authorise copies to be forwarded to local offices, libraries, community councils, and so on. That basic system would ensure that every application is known to the public. The information would be disseminated through a simple, common sense system. It would be open to members of the public to make inquiries about those applications, and to obtain the maximum information. The gazette could be updated and circulated monthly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a revolutionary proposal, and although it clearly goes a little beyond the scope of the amendment, it has much to commend it in trying to get over a hurdle, that is not hypothetical, but which exists in many rural areas of Scotland. People do not know what is happening until it occurs. If there were a set procedure for forestry developments to be notified and publicised, that obstacle would disappear, because there would be enough interested bodies—both at a local and national level—to consider such obstacles. SNH will play a major role in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask for the Minister's response to what is universally perceived to be a problem. In recent years, some forestry developments have been disastrous for the environment, so it is logical and sensible that SNH should be consulted. We have gone a stage further with the constructive spirit we have already shown by suggesting, in conjunction with the World Wide Fund for Nature, a specific proposal as to how that information could be disseminated. I hope that the Minister will react positively to our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

been prepared and issued by the Forestry Commission, after consultation with those two bodies. They cover a wide range of important matters, including landscape, nature conservation, and water.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Environmental assessments will take place for applications for planting grant in areas above a certain size. My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridgeshire, South-East said that damage had occurred in the past, and he referred to uplands. The situation in England is slightly different from Scotland, as there is much more planting on uplands there than south of the border. Stronger action was taken in England by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to layout, I cite an example of action that we took in the flow country, when we asked for a land use study, which we considered together with fiscal changes that were introduced. I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridgeshire, South-East that we encourage regional authorities to prepare indicative forestry strategies that will complement the consultation procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forestry Commission is examining the role of regional planning authorities, following the preparation of such strategies, with a view to making the consultation arrangements more effective. That, coupled with the arrangements for consultation between the Forestry Commission and SNH—which are likely to go beyond those that exist between the commission and the NCCS and CCS—will ensure that environmental sensitivities attaching to new planting proposals will be fully considered at an early stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of controversial applications, I know of no case—certainly since the most recent general election—of the Forestry Commission acting against the advice of Ministers. I remind the Committee that contentious applications are considered by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) asked about climatic change. Clause 3(a) will allow SNH to take appropriate account of climatic change, and that work is likely to be undertaken through the Joint Nature Conservancy Council. SNH will play a full part in international forums, both on its own and with its sister agencies through the Joint Nature Conservancy Council. SNH will inherit the NCC's responsibilities, which it will develop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

rain forest. As an extension of such arguments, it is important to take proper account of them here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be for SNH to agree with the Forestry Commission the circumstances in which consultations would take place on forestry planting proposals. That is the usual and practical way for things to be done. The consultation arrangements between the Forestry Commission and SNH will certainly reflect those currently agreed between the commission and the NCCS and the CCS, especially when dealing with planting grants in SSSIs and national scenic areas. The arrangements are likely to go somewhat further if any significant planting is proposed in natural heritage areas. Of course, we have yet to debate an amendment, which I shall table shortly, on natural heritage areas, which will state what we have in mind for such areas. I do not envisage that any problems will arise in respect of the arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Forestry Commission has made it clear that it intends to work closely with SNH at all levels, and the imposition of a blanket requirement to notify would impose an unnecessary burden on both bodies. SNH will have many administrative tasks to undertake and it would not wish to have to devote time and money to consider planting proposals which, because of their nature or location, pose no threat to the natural heritage of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As regards the proposed referral of applications for forestry grant aid to the Secretary of State and the right of SNH to object to such applications, I am afraid that my hon. Friends misunderstand the statutory position of the forestry commissioners and their relationship with the Secretary of State. Ministers cannot direct the commissioners on what decision to make on an individual grant application; they can only advise. I believe that the present consultation arrangements deal adequately with the anxieties that have been expressed. The arrangements are set out in a ministerial direction made under section 1(4) of the Forestry Act 1967. Under that direction, the forestry commissioners, faced with a

sustained objection from a consultee—which would include SNH for designated landscape and nature conservation areas and any other areas agreed between SNH and the Forestry Commission—cannot approve a forestry grant aid application without first obtaining a ministerial view.

The amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Western Isles (Mr. Macdonald) is not necessary. He will know that the issue was raised by the Select Committee on Agriculture in its report. We are aware of the issue and believe that there is no need for a system of licences for planting large or small areas, because little planting has been done without the benefit of Forestry Commission grant aid and that is unlikely to change. Also, almost all planting is subject to the consultation procedures that the Forestry commission operates. If a planting proposal were likely to have a significant environmental impact, it would be subject to the environmental assessment regulations, so the proposed statutory controls are not required—at least at present. If circumstances were to change significantly, we would be prepared to consider a licensing system. Given the present position, it would not be appropriate for SNH or another organisation to have the function of licensing forestry. I hope that the hon. Member for Western Isles accepts that, and that he will not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still disappointed by what the Minister said. Surely it would be better to try to plug the potential loophole before it is exploited. We should, as it were, close the door before the horse has a chance to bolt. I accept that there have not been cases of forestry development taking place outside the grant aid schemes, which would naturally bring them under the scrutiny of the Forestry Commission, but there is every reason to suppose that forestry will expand considerably in future, especially as reforms to the common agricultural policy progress and as good forestry land starts to become more lucrative and more economic.

In the recent MacAuley lecture, the chairman of the Highlands and Islands Development Board—now Highlands and Island Enterprise—said that the proportion of land that had been afforested in the highlands and islands was still fairly small. From the controversies that have been reported in the newspapers in recent years, we gained the impression that the highlands and islands is being subjected to vast tracts of forestry. That is contrary to the facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, only 13 per cent of the area is afforested, compared with a United Kingdom average of 15 per cent That difference is striking. The average throughout the European Community is about 25 per cent. In Germany, 35 per cent. of the land is afforested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is great potential for afforestation in the highlands and islands, and in Scotland as a whole. As good land is removed from cereal production, there will be more potential for afforestation, without the use of grant aid. Although there has been a slump in planting during the past couple of years because of the Budget which removed tax exemptions for forestry, we do not expect that to continue. We

	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
anticipate an upswing and pressure for more afforestation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the indicative strategies that are being organised by local authorities. They can play a main role in bringing together various interested parties. I am heartened to know that, over the years, the Scottish Office has encouraged local authorities to engage in such indicative strategies. When supervising the implementation of those strategies, it would be helpful if local authorities had a system of planting licences. After all, that would be analogous to the system of felling licenses. There could be a set procedure by which each prospective plantation was reviewed by a public agency, so it could be directly involved in the process.

	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
I hoped, too, that the Minister would have responded more positively to the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) about the concept of a gazette, or a list, of prospective plantations. It could be made available not only to public agencies such as SNH, local authorities and the Forestry Commission, which would know about the plantations anyway, but to members of the public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
