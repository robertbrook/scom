	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 405, in page 7, line 32, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) This section shall not have effect until all second level registered nurses employed by the NHS who wish to take the conversion course leading to first level registration of the UKCC register have done so.".</p></blockquote>
All information about the position of nurses in the foreseeable future, from the Royal College of Nursing and from the Government, shows that there will be an increasing and alarming shortage of nurses, and that due to the demographic time bomb we must keep as many trained nurses as possible if we are to avoid real shortages later in the century.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly outline the background to the problem that enrolled nurses are facing now. Nursing recruits who opted for second, rather than first, level training did so because some preferred a two-year to a three-year course and others because they did not have the necessary academic qualifications. Different demands exist in different parts of the country for academic qualifications. For example, London teaching hospitals often require recruits to have A-levels to become first-level nurses. However, in provincial hospitals, further away from the main teaching hospitals, one or two O-levels will do. We want to see the end of other divisions in nursing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the 1950s and 1960s, many black nurses were recruited from the West Indies. Often, they were directed on to the two-year course, not realising its limitations or that the certificate that they would be given would not be recognised in their own country. In some cases it was felt that discrimination was the reason why black nurses were persuaded to become second, rather than first, level nurses. When nurses failed the State Registered Nurse examination—as it was known then—they were automatically put on to the enrolled nurse roll.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to stress that enrolled nurses have played a vital part in running the NHS. It is true that, in practice, enrolled nurses have been used interchangeably with staff nurses on wards, especially for psychiatric and geriatric nursing and for unsocial hours at night. Therefore, they have a right to feel bitter about the way in which they have been treated. They stuck in a no-woman's-land of training and they have been subjected
	<span class='label label-info column'>478</span>
to regrading exercises, which many of them consider to be degrading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 97,000 enrolled nurses employed in the NHS, and many want to take the conversion course to obtain first-level status. An Institute of Manpower Services survey conducted in 1989 used 3,014 respondents. The following table shows the percentages of enrolled nurses who wanted to undertake conversion courses:

The IMS survey showed, therefore, that about a third of enrolled nurses wanted to undertake conversion courses. Another third said that they might wish to do in future, but did not know at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My DHA funded conversion courses for five years and only 10 enrolled nurses have converted. That problem is spread across the country. The survey showed also that 50 per cent. of all enrolled nurses were dissatisfied with their grades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before 1983, enrolled nurses had to take a 97-week course leading to first-level registration, but following discussions on Project 2000 the United Kingdom Central Council introduced 52-week courses, the first ones being approved in 1985–86. At first, the ratio of students to tutors on the courses was 10:1. Sadly, that has now been changed to 15:1 because of the shortage of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to convert, enrolled nurses, or second-level nurses as they prefer to be called, have to meet the EC nursing directive requirements during the course by, for example, gaining experience in psychiatric, community and maturnity nursing. The rules also allow schools to develop flexible courses. They can give credits to nurses for specific courses, for education and for experience. We must remember that these nurses have been holding down responsible positions in the NHS for many years, and it is good to know that flexibility to include experience is now included. In addition, schools may use open and distance learning. In theory a maximum of six months' remission can be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite this and all the good words and worthy intentions .there are still only 1,000 to 1,500 conversion course places available annually, and these are being chased by 30,000 enrolled nurses. There is much dissatisfaction, and morale is low among those nurses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Sky (Mr. Kennedy) and I attended a conference of enrolled nurses a week or two ago. I wish that hon. Members here had heard the passionate speeches from those nurses about their dissatisfaction, and how they were being ditched by the NHS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another factor causing bitterness and unease is that most DH As accept only enrolled nurses from their own districts, which makes life more difficult for nurses with health authorities that do not provide conversion courses. I talked to the Royal College of Nursing about this problem and it is adamant that all DHAs should be required by Government directive to provide conversion courses for enrolled nurses. I hope that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>479</span>
Government will take note of that view on the basis that the RCN is a body to which they should listen. That is the least that the Government can do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that there is an increasing and alarming shortage of nurses. The DHAs are endeavouring to retain the nurses that they have, because they are conscious of the problems that will face them in a few years' time. If enrolled nurses are to be retained in the NHS, their skills must be recognised and they must have career prospects. If they cannot get on a conversion course, they feel, justifiably, that they are on a ladder to nowhere. They feel that they are wanted only when no one else is around, but then they are ditched and told that there are no prospects for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Project 2000, a qualified nurse will be aided by a support worker, so it is vital that enrolled nurses are not caught betweeen the highly skilled nurse with first-level training and the assistant at the bottom. The Department of Health's own document, "A Strategy for Nursing", recognises the need to enhance the career qualifications of enrolled nurses, but so far it has not provided the resources for that purpose. That is why the amendment is important, and I hope that the Minister will take it very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the RCN and other nursing unions are worried that self-governing hospital trusts will be under no obligation and have no incentive to provide conversion courses. The trusts will have the right to employ whatever nursing staff they wish, and they will be able to offer differing rates of pay. My hon. Friends and I are worried that there will be a top layer of skilled first-level nurses and under it there will be a huge pyramid of nursing assistants who will receive just the vocational training course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trusts may take the view that as enrolled nurses are currently carrying out the duties of first-level nurses, there is no need to convert them at extra cost. They may feel that the cost of conversion should fall on the NHS hospitals under DHA control. That would be bad news for the Health Service, because we need to keep as many nurses as possible. In some areas, especially if self-governing hospitals are in a monopoly position, potential returners can be lost to the service for ever if there are no conversion courses, and nurses may decide to opt out of working for the NHS altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We, like the nurses' unions and the RCN, would welcome any information that the Minister can give us about the trusts and their obligation towards conversion courses, and I urge the Minister to accept what, in my view, is a very reasonable amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Health (Mrs. Virginia Bottomley)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) for drawing attention to the central role of nurses in the NHS. They are the most numerous professional group, and I am sure that we all accept their importance. The hon. Lady drew attention to some areas where further work is needed. I draw her attention to the progress that has been made on Project 2000. The other day I visited Portsmouth, the first Project 2000 unit, where there is a clear commitment to end what the hon. Lady described as the two-tier system of the past and to ensure that nurses are properly qualified for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>480</span>
As 1 am sure the hon. Lady will know, the money allocated to Project 2000 includes an element for second-level registration conversion, and 232 additional places have been made available for that purpose in the past year. We are actively encouraging health authorities to plan for more places as part of their education stategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear, however, that the status of existing second-level nurses is not under threat. Concern has been expressed by second-level nurses who are not anxious to have first-level training, that their status may be questioned. I assure them that that will not happen, and that they will still be eligible for education and training within the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes that no one could be moved to an NHS trust until all the second-level registered nurses employed had been given the chance of taking a conversion course. When my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State wrote to the chairman of the United Kingdom Central Council on 18 May, he dealt with many of the issues that concern the hon. Lady. My right hon. and learned Friend made it clear that he expects the second-level registered nurse training courses to continue over the next five years. It would therefore not be right to require that all nurses be given that opportunity before any staff had the opportunity to transfer to an NHS trust. The training of nurses is extremely important, but we are sure that the benefits inherent in NHS trusts will result in improved patient care and will be an important step forward for patients within the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why cannot the availability of these courses be brought forward? Should it not be possible for every nurse who wants to convert be able to do so in the immediate future? What is the obstacle? Is it money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any Department has to decide how to deploy its resources. I tried to be uncontroversial in my opening remarks in response to the hon. Member for Halifax, but the fact is that nurses' pay is one of the areas in which we have decided to invest heavily. Nurses have seen their pay rise by 43 per cent.— [

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Amber Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What happened when the Labour Government were in power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bottomley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not going to mention that, but as my hon. Friend asks, I feel bound to say that nurses' pay fell by 21 percent in real terms, although I am sorry that my hon. Friend dragged that information out of me. In fact, we have invested heavily in nurses, and we shall continue to draw the attention of health authorities and others to the importance of offering conversion courses to second-level nurses. The NHS trusts will have to make such decisions for themselves, taking account of their circumstances, skill mixes and projections of manpower requirements, but they will be expected to honour any commitments that were made to individual members of staff before the transfer to trust employment about participating in training courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All nurses will be encouraged to know that among the executive directors of NHS trusts concerned with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>481</span>
nursing services will be the senior nursing, manager. The hon. Member for Halifax did not mention this but my hon. Friends feel that it is extremely important that it be known because it will ensure that nurses' needs will be recognised and responded to adequately. I hope that the hon.Lady will accept that the amendment is neither appropriate nor necessary in the context of transfer of staff to NHS trust employment. I hope also that she and other members of the Committee will accept my strong assurance that we wish to make all possible headway in ensuring that nurses of all grades have an opportunity for the training and choices that we all believe are so vital to the Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Mahon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed by the response of the Minister for Health. I do not think that she understands some of the problems facing second-level nurses. At the conference, we learnt from nurses that after 30 years' experience they were not trusted with the keys to do medicine rounds. Many of humiliations are being heaped upon them. Few of the nurses who attended the conference will gain confidence from knowing that directors of nursing will be given senior executive roles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about the extra resources element and the fact that 232 places were found last year. That is merely a drop in the ocean when one considers that almost 60,000 nurses have been caught in this limbo—this no-women's land. I feel strongly about the matter and, on behalf of nurses, I think that we should have on record the names of those hon. Members who have decided that 97,000 nurses are not important enough to receive training to bring them to first-level status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 465, in page 7, line 32, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(7) An NHS Trust may not so limit a consultants contract so as to restrict his private practice to the NHS Trust's own beds.".</p></blockquote>
An NHS trust will seek to develop an additional income by competing for private patients, using pay beds or its own private wing. For the consultant with private patients, this would have advantages because of its proximity to the NHS hospitals in which he
	<span class='label label-info column'>482</span>
spends most of his time and sees most of his patients. It is easier for him to visit a private wing than to travel some miles to see private patients in an independent hospital. As drafted, however, the clause contains potential for serious disadvantages and this should be rectified. In spite of the inherent advantage, some NHS trust managers have already indicated that they will attempt to force consultants to use NHS trust private facilities exclusively by inserting the requirement into consultants' contracts, and offer a bonus or a donation to research funds that is based on the number of private patients admitted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I consider that undersirable for a number of reasons. First, it would deny the patient choice. The Bill is all about extending choice for NHS patients. The same opportunity should not be denied to private patients. They should not be forced into a particular unit because the consultant is obliged by the terms of his contract to use it exclusively. It would be ironic if under the Bill, which extends choice to NHS patients, private patients were denied choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly if consultants receive an incentive or even if a condition of service requires the admission of patients to a particular unit, GMC regulations insist that consultants who have a financial interest in a unit must declare it to patients before admitting them. The Government must look into that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, consultants may find themselves in trouble with the Inland Revenue. If a contract specifies that their private practice should be limited to a percentage of their income, and take place in a particular unit, that will be regarded as a condition of employment rather than a separate activity. Their private practice income will be taxed at a higher rate rather than as a separate business activity. It may be seen as a restraint on trade and interference with the individual rights of consultants to decide, in their private practice, what is the best for their patients. They will not wish this restraint to be imposed upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important element is the limitation of choice for patients and for consultants. A Bill which extends NHS patient choice should not restrict private sector patients' choice nor restrict the consultants' choice of where to perform operations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Harriet Harman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Peckham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is great irony in the way in which the amendment has been moved. Only a few moments ago, Conservative Members were anguished and shedding crocodile tears about the prospect of anyone trying to impose central guidance or regulation on self-governing trusts. We are told that they must be free from any restriction so as to be able to manage exactly as they wish. That, they think, is all very well for low-paid staff, because they can be exploited. The rhetoric about the right of SGTs to manage themselves suddenly stops dead, however, when it comes to consultants in hospitals not being able to undertake private practice wherever they wish even if the trust board feels that that is not in a hospital's interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the activities, decisions and plans of NHS trust managers. I remind him that there are no HNS self-governing trusts. There is not even an Act on the statute book yet. Our point all along has been that, without heed to Parliament's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>483</span>
views and to public opinion, the Government are spending public money to put their proposals into action. That, in my view, is underhand and ultra vires. I hope that the Government reject the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say a few words about private medicine. I draw the Committee's attention to the National Audit Office report, which provided a timely warning that further growth in private health care will increase the conflict with the NHS because of a shortage of consult ants. I repeat that that was a report by the NAO, although it backed up assertions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Audit Office research supports what we have been asserting for years and the Government have denied. I hope that they will not seek further to deny the conflict of interest that exists when consultants spend much of their time working in the private sector. The research found that the private sector—we shall no doubt include the self-governing trusts in the private sector in due course—employed only 1,750 full-time consultants. It depends on another 12,000 who spend most of their time working in the NHS. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government is encouraging private hospitals, but they will not be able to expand without NHS consultants either doing more work outside the normal working week or without many full-time consultants switching to part-time work and thereby reducing their case load."</p></blockquote>
That is a quote from the report. A further quote from the report reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These findings suggest that a further increase in private health care either inside or outside the NHS"—</p></blockquote>
and it could have added, or within or outside self-governing trusts—
	<br><blockquote><p>"will increase the conflict of commitment unless there is a significant increase in the number of NHS consultants or a change in the type of contract they hold."</p></blockquote>
What are the Government planning to do about the NAO report? Will they take action, or simply shelve it? When the Minister replies, I hope that she will reject the amendment and deal with the NAO report. Our objection to the amendment and to private medicine is because the conflict of interest inhibits the NHS.

My hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mr. Hinchliffe) mentioned our concern about queue jumping. It must be wrong, if we regard ourselves as a civilised, humane society, to institutionalise and encourage a system where, for example, the heart defect of a millionaire's daughter is treated rapidly
	<span class='label label-info column'>484</span>
while the heart defect of a daughter born to a lorry driver, or to an unemployed person, is side-lined, regarded as less important and left at the end of a waiting list. When we set out objectives, queue jumping should have no place in society. We should not institutionalise in the system the idea that it is fair or right for people to be encouraged to queue jump and give those who cannot afford to do so a raw deal.

We are opposed to private medicine on the pragmatic ground of cost. We have said for years that the private sector is inefficient and costly. We are talking about the allocation of a nation's resources, and it makes no sense to put them into a system that is inefficient, wasteful and expensive. All the evidence shows that the private sector is more expensive than the public sector, and we are against it on the pragmatic ground of cost and value for money.

The other point about private medicine, which unfortunately appears to be lost on Conservative Members, is that private medicine is not even good for people who have plenty of money and can afford it.

Perhaps I shall again be accused of looking for wrong where everything is right, but on this occasion I am supported by the HAO report. I shall quote page 17 for the interest of the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett). In relation to the west midlands, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The region also reported that some 23 per cent of the whole-time consultant work force had breached the limit in 1986–87."</p></blockquote>
In effect, that meant that consultants had breached their contracts. There is clear evidence in the report that consultants do that. The report tells us that the British Medical Association expressed the view that as many as 10 per cent of consultants may be in breach of their contracts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I believe that if we are to have these blessed trusts, trust directors must have a system to ensure the most effective monitoring of consultants' contracts. If consultants are to be allowed to undertake private work, let it be confined to trust premises where at least the boards of directors—these blessed people—will have at least the ability to monitor what is going on. If they do not, and work is done outwith hospital premises, the practice of consultants breaching their contracts will persist.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Peckham (Ms. Harman) made a series of extremely tendentious claims in her contribution. It might distort the judgment of the Committee if her statements are not corrected. It was clear that the hon. Lady was unsure of her ground because she was unwilling to accept any interventions during her speech. Moreover, she made the extraordinarily self-contradictory assertion that private patients were more privileged than NHS patients and therefore the existence of private medicine was unfair. A moment later, the hon. Lady said that private patients were subjected by the medical profession to superfluous and unnecessary treatments and procedures and were therefore underprivileged. Both arguments cannot be sustained at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is Impossible not to accept the existence of private medicine. It leads to more resources, in aggregate, being channelled to medicine. More medical outputs, at primary and secondary level are delivered than

Opposition Members have not distinguished themselves by failing to show a sophisticated understanding of the economics of health care. One of the fundamental characteristics of health care, especially at the secondary hospital level, is that there are considerable economies of scale. Hospitals supply and sell services to the private sector, thus the private sector supports a portion of the overheads of running the hospitals. To the extent to which a proportion of those overheads are carried by the private sector, resources provided by the taxpayer to fund the NHS buy a greater number of services and medical outputs than would otherwise be the case. It is time that the Opposition focused on that fundamental aspect of private health care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those employees who transfer to an NHS trust will retain their existing contracts and all rights arising from them, subject to technical amendments and changes such as the substitution of the new employer and so on. It is for the trust to introduce changes in the existing contracts at any time after the transfer and to determine the pay and conditions of their staff. Consultants will be treated no differently from any other member of a professional team in an NHS trust. Each member of the team has a value and each is enormously important to the Health Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a trust were to try to introduce a contract of employment that limited a consultant's freedom to undertake private practice, it would be for the consultant to decide whether it was acceptable. The trusts should negotiate the changes that they believe are important in the circumstances. For that reason, in spite of my hon. Friend's powerful arguments which some NHS trust managements may find of merit, the Government cannot accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members waged a vendetta against the private sector. The National Audit Office report made a valuable comment about contracting.

The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours and the hon. Member for Peckham referred to the National Audit Office. I challenged them to state the numbers of relevant paragraphs. Neither could do so. The hon. Member for Workington had the cheek to accuse me of not doing my homework when I asked him to jsutify his remarks. Far from being an attack on the concept of consultants and private medicine, as the hon. Gentleman claimed, paragraph 3.18 states that the North Staffordshire and City and Hackney districts monitored consultant attendance and found no abuse. Paragraph 3.24 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There was also insufficient evidence at health authorities visited to enable the National Audit Office to make a judgement as to the extent to which NHS commitments are fulfilled … All health authorities visited were adamant that the great majority of their consultants worked more than their contracted hours, but conceded that there might be a small and largely undetected number of consultants neglecting their NHS commitments."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>488</span>
Paragraph 3.29 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the National Audit Office acknowledge that the new disciplinary framework should indirectly increase the pressure on consultants to honour their NHS commitments and allow health authorities more scope for action in cases of suspected neglect".</p></blockquote>
The NAO noted that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the 1989 White Paper included proposals for fuller job descriptions which should enable districts to monitor compliance with contracts."</p></blockquote>

Before continuing I invite the appropriate Minister to clarify the position by intervening. I understand that this is the territory of the Under-Secretary of State for Health, who is the appointed auditor to look after the accountancy side of the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is my problem for the Minister. I am well aware, from reading the White Paper and subsequent working papers, that the Government's intentions are to apply capital charges across the Health Service. Working paper 5 on capital charges is explicit that every hospital and NHS facility will be liable to make a payment on a capital charge back to the RHA and from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>489</span>
there presumably back to the Treasury. 1 have teased the Under-Secretary into helping me because my difficulty is that nowhere else in the Bill can I find provision for capital charges on properties that are not to become NHS trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two possible explanations. First, I have not been sufficiently diligent in my reading of the Bill and have missed a subsection that should have been brought to my attention or, alternatively, the Government do not intend to proceed with capital charges for directly managed services. There is a third option, which I suspect is the correct one: the Government intend to impose capital charges across the rest of the service but do not need explicit powers in the Bill because they propose to act under existing powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we authorise the clause's entry into the statute book, I should like guidance from the Under-Secretary on which of the three options is correct and on whether I am right in suspecting that it is still the Minister's intention to apply capital charges across the sector, using existing powers rather than any pending legislative power. I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he can give me an answer now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Mr. Roger Freeman)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I made the position plain now. For directly-managed hospitals and other units that are not NHS trusts, we intend to introduce a capital charges regime. Now is not the time to go into the rationale or mechanics of the capital charging scheme, which was spelt out clearly in the working paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With NHS trusts—especially hospitals—the provisions are different from those for directly-managed hospitals, but the net effect is the same. They will operate on the same level playing field. The NHS trusts must appreciate their assets; they must also make a 6 per cent. real return on average assets in addition to the depreciation, which they keep. They may or may not distribute the 6 per cent. return through interest or public dividend capital. Directly-managed hospitals will pay a capital charge to the RHA—capital charge is a combination of depreciation and return—and the RHA will recirculate the capital charge to the districts, which purchase services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Cook</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: 1 am grateful for that explanation but sorry to say that, because of its nature, I cannot draw my comments to a close.

For the time being, I say only that when we reach that clause we shall make serious criticism of the Government's propsals for capital charges across the directly-managed sector.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The agreement to pursue the matter in greater detail on clause 18 seems perfectly fair. Although clause 9, taken in conjunction with clause 18, seems dessicated and technical, it has important implications. Perhaps the Minister can give us now, or let us know before we debate clause 18, the details of how the capital charge system is to work. We wish to know whether the basis of capital charging is to be use values, replacement values or market values. Much depends upon which of those three possible methods of taking a base for capital charges is used. Large city hospital sites will be gravely disadvantaged and put at risk if open market value is taken as the basis of the capital charging principle. Modern hospitals on large city hospital sites are in special need of protection from that disadvantage. I trust that these issues can be fully explained and laid before us so that we shall be able to debate clause 18 fully and properly.

The hon. Members for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) and for Peckham (Ms. Harman) spoke about gifted assets such as scanners in NHS trusts.

They will, of course, have to be depreciated because hospitals will have to make provision for a replacement after the gift. I give hon.

	<div class='title'>FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS OF NHS TRUSTS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>5.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 467, in page 10, line 5, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>"such outgoings to include proper provision for repayment of capital debt and loan charges".</p></blockquote>
The clause deals with the financial obligations of NHS trusts, and subsection (1) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"Every NHS trust shall ensure that its revenue is not less than sufficient, taking one financial year with another, to meet outgoings properly chargeable to revenue account."</p></blockquote>
It does now however, mention capital debt and loan charges, and any comparison between the costs of the independent sector and those of the state sector, including the NHS trusts, should be made on a proper basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The efficient functioning of a provider market involving NHS trust hospitals, directly managed hospitals and independent hospitals requires a fair comparison of cost and pricing structures. The calculation of capital charges for each hospital and the requirement to repay capital debt and loan charges is an important component of costings. It is important to emphasise that those charges are a proper part of a hospital cost and pricing calcuation, but the clause in its present form does not make that sufficiently clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An NHS trust hospital will seek to increase its income from a variety of sources. It will make contracts with a number of health authorities and fund-holding GPs. It will also compete for private patients using pay beds or its private wing. That is a valid method of achieving additional income. However, it is important that such income should exceed expenditure, and that the private patients activity should make a profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current attitude among NHS hospital managers is to regard the total fee income from the insurers as their profit. They do not appear to account for even revenue expenditure, certainly not for capital. While they generate income, they do not know whether they make a profit or a loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To ensure that a profit is made, all appropriate costs must be collected and charged, they include the costs of drugs, dressing, theatre charges, staff costs, overhead costs of heat, light and catering, and diagnostic procedures such as pathology tests and radiology. In addition, the large item concerned with interest on capital must be included. If all those charges are not made, or not recovered from the patient's insurer, the costs will be borne by the NHS patient. It would be quite wrong to charge DHAs a contract price which also required it to subsidise the activities of the private wing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, an NHS trust, proposing to open a new wing or any additional private beds, must prepare a proper feasibility study to show how quickly the new beds will become profitable. Hospitals cannot assume that any new private bed will be immediately profitable. In some places, such as London and the west midlands, there is already a large number of private
	<span class='label label-info column'>492</span>
beds with low occupancy levels. The NHS trusts entering those markets must do so with their eyes open, aware that they are likey to sustain losses for some years and that during that time they will be using NHS funds to make good the deficiency—money that they could be using for NHS patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that private practice in NHS trusts is not subsidised by funds raised in respect of NHS patients—something that Opposition Members will surely welcome—but it will ensure also that they are on a proper footing with the truly independent hospitals that have to bear such costs as part of their capital charges. There should be a fair and level playing field of comparison between all three parts of the hospital sector—NHS hospitals, NHS trusts and the independent sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Freeman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a helpful amendment, and I can give my hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) the assurance that he seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capitalisation of the NHS trusts upon establishment will be split between interest-bearing debt and public dividend capital, as agreed. The proportions will vary according to each individual trust established. There will be an obligation upon the trusts to make a 6 per cent, return on the average assets, befoe any payment of interest and before any public dividend capital. That is 6 per cent. in real terms and equivalent to 6 per cent. on current values. That is in line with obligations within the public sector. Payment will be made to meet that return both for interest payments on the initial debt and dividend payments on the public dividend capital which may or may not be waived according to the financial needs and circumstances of the trusts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obligation to which my hon. Friend refers of taking one year with another to break even occurs after depreciation charges and interest payments but not the principal repayments on the debt, which is capital in nature, not interest. It is also after dividend payments on public dividend capital. That is an obligation. If there is a surplus above that, with agreement that surplus can be ploughed back into the further development of the hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for new borrowings for financial development, the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) implied that the trusts will be going to the City, but that is most unlikely to happen. The public gilt rate, the access to public sector borrowing, will almost invariably be cheaper and therefore financing for the development of trusts will come from the Treasury and not from the City. However, there may be instances—for example, short-term debt or where there is a particularly attractive source of capital at cheaper rates than the Government can borow—when trusts go to the City. For most borrowings that will have to be sanctioned, and there will be an external financing limit in aggregate and for each individual trust. The external financing limit will clearly be gross capital expenditure agreed less the depreciation flow and any surplus generated by the hospital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the Government's credit is greater than that which is available from the private sector and will be the normal source of borrowing to finance expansion. Capital programmes, however, will be controlled through the external financing limit.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hospital will need to increase its charges and adjust its services of staffing levels. Like any other enterprise, it must break even.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that the weather is bad and that hon. Members want to get away from Westminster. Therefore, I shall make my remarks as brief as possible. I appreciate that many of the issues contained in the amendments have already been debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have given assurances about English clauses to the Bill and Conservative Members claim that that is sufficient to give the legislation standing. I gather that for English law that is true. However, it is not true for Scottish law. Nothing that a Minister says during the passage of a Bill at any stage has any standing in a Scottish court. Not only that, what a Minister has said may not even be raised in a Scottish court. Therefore, it is important to Scots that what is on the face of the Bill is right because that is what stands in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments refer to universities and medical teaching. I make three points in four amendments. First, I would not introduce opt-out hospitals—self-governing or NHS trusts. I feel strongly about medical training, and those hospitals that are closely linked, and undertake medical teaching, should not be included in the Bill. The links between universities and hospitals are so important that it is difficult to see how the division can be made to allow them to continue medical training work and research and at the same time act in the profit-making way that the Minister advocates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, if any hospital undertaking teaching for a university becomes part of a NHS trust, the university must be represented. In the White Paper, the Government said:
	<br><blockquote><p> "For teaching hospitals, the non-executive directors will need to include someone drawn from the relevant medical school."</p></blockquote>
When we read the Bill, However, we find that "may" is used, not "shall". There is no need for a NHS trust or the Secretary of State to appoint anyone from a medical school to the board of directors. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment because it will give assurance to people like the principal of Dundee university. The hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye (Mr. Kennedy) asked similar questions because of the grave anxieties expressed by the principals of Glasgow university and Aberdeen university. The principal of Dundee university says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where sefl-governing hospitals are established, it is vital that Universities are adequately represented, as of right, on the Board. Universities arc the sole providers of the nation's highly trained medical and dental manpower. Political dogma at this stage must not be permitted to put at risk the supply of doctors and dentists in the decades to come."</p></blockquote>
I hope that Ministers are aware of that.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some consultants in teaching hospitals, thought they carry out medical duties such as performing operations, are employed by universities, normally at senior lecturer level. They may work alongside consultants with the same specialty who are employed by the NHS. According to the Scottish clauses in the Bill—I do not know whether the English clauses contain the same provisions—a consultant who is employed by a university will not change his employer if the hopital in which he works becomes an NHS trust. An NHS trust, however, in order to keep the skills of, say, a kidney transplant surgeon, may pay him considerably more than his university-employed colleague who does exactly the same job. I know, from talking to them, that people in such situations will be attracted away from medical education to consultancies. A consultant would have to be very strong willed and committed in order not to give up a university job when his colleague, who may be junior in terms of age, experience and qualifications, is being paid £10,000 or £15,000 a year more. In that way universities may lose expertise and teaching experience, which would be very damaging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may assure me that that problem will not arise, but my reading of the Bill suggests otherwise. I know that consultants in similar positions are worried about it and would like the Minister's assurance, and preferably a provision in the Bill, to make sure that it does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Charles Kennedy 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ross, Cromarty and Skye)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had two bites of the cherry already, so I shall be brief. My argument continues that of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) about the Scottish universities. The Under-Secretary of State for Health gave a slightly helpful reply on Tuesday evening on the question of statutory representation for academics working in hospitals. I hope that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will reflect that heplful attitude by showing that he will, at least, keep an open mind, though we should prefer him to accept amendment No. 416.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart mentioned the principal of Dundee university. By the time we have finished debating the Bill the principals of all of the Scottish universities may have been mentioned, and not being quoted in Committee may prove to be a great accolade for the principals. The correspondence of the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and Sir William Kerr Fraser, the principal of Glasgow university, has already been the subject of exchanges in Committee. In an earlier sitting, the Under-Secretary claimed that his reply to Sir William had cleared up all remaining doubts on the subject and left everyone happy. It is obvious that everyone is not happy. In a letter dated 15 January, Sir William wrote the following, to which I should like the Minister to reply, on the implications of the internal market for education, especially with regard to general managers:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I raised the question of how thew success or failure of General Managers would be assessed; and I find nothing in your letter"—</p></blockquote>
that is the Minister's letter—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to refute my conclusion that the criteria to be applied have nothing to do with medical education. I did not refer, as you imply, to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>496</span>
absence of any bankable assurance on this matter on the face of the Bill—although I could well have done so."</p></blockquote>
So, at the top levels of academia and medicine in Scotland, and south of the border as we heard from the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) there is continuing anxiety. It has not been redressed by ministerial assurances, and one amendment on statutory representation would be a small, but significant step in the right direction. I hope that the Minister will be able to offer more reassurance than he has given so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be able to help the hon. Gentleman a little. I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and was puzzled because he did not justify amendment No. 416, which would prevent teaching hospitals becoming NHS trusts. It is ridiculous to argue that the hospitals that have most to gain from taking decisions at hospital level and having more control over their own affairs should be excluded. The hon. Gentleman cannot expect me to recommend that to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 420 would allow a university with close links with an NHS trust to appoint one of the non-executive directors of that trust. The Government are opposed in principle to anyone other than the Secretary of State appointing members to Health Services bodies, because those appointed would have a confusion of roles. They cannot both represent the bodies that appointed them and take part in the deliberations of the bodies to which they have been appointed. There is no need for the amendment because its aims are already provided for. Schedule 6 makes provision for the Secretary of State to appoint a person from a relevant university or medical or dental school where a trust has a significant teaching commitment. In those circumstances such members will always be appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome that assurance, although I cannot see why, if it is so firm, it cannot be written into the Bill. But the Minister asserted that people with direct constituency interests who were appointed to health boards or the new trusts could not function effectively because of their dual function. He suggested that there might be competing claims: the interests of the trust versus the sectional interest that they represent. Will he please give us evidence that the system is breaking down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would be aware of the conflicts that could arise in any organisation to which someone is appointed as a representative of a political party. As a member of the not-much-lamented alliance, he must be acutely conscious of the difficulties that people can face when representing the views of a body that does not meet the wider interests of, say, his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is anxious to make progress, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider the other amendments. Amendment No. 482, which is in my name, would help to meet his aims, and those of the hon. Member for Cathcart. The same arguments apply against amendments Nos. 409 and 420. I therefore
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1989-1990V003P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>497</span>
suggest that the hon. Gentleman withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister replied to the point about staff who are employed jointly. As my hon. Friend the Member for Monklands, West (Mr. Clarke) pointed out, it is ironic for the man who is both chairman of the Conservative party in Scotland and Minister of the Crown to talk about confusion of roles. If anyone confuses his role, as Minister and high-profile political animal, it is the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why universities should not have a statutory position on any NHS trust. The fact that the Secretary of State will appoint them does not mean that they will not be linked with universities. Moreover, I want universities to be on the boards not to examine the boards' profits but to represent medical schools and the medical teaching that it being done in hospitals. There job is not to see whether profit margins are up or whether costs are being kept down, but to ensure that medical teaching is being done in hospitals. I therefore want my amendments to be carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reply to my point about university staff employed in the hospitals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that I had not picked up his point relating to amendment No. 424, and I apologise for that. He is wrong to say that members of NHS trusts will represent any particular group or interest. Each member of a trust, whether executive or non-executive, will have a duty to ensure that the trust's obligations, including teaching and research, are met. He is wrong to suggest that members of the trust will have any duty other than that. Equally, those who will represent the interests of universities, or medical or dental schools, will operate on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our provisions are therefore somewhat wider than those of the hon. Gentleman. The purpose of the changes is to get away from consensus representation on health boards, which is a legacy from the previous Labour Government. We have made considerable progress towards changing that in Scotland, which has resulted in great benefit to patient care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's last statement should be widely circulated, because it makes nonsense of the other assurances that we have heard whilst debating the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister's argument about sectional representatives on hospital trusts were extended, one would say that Cabinet government in Britain could not work because Ministers sit around the table representing Departments. That responsibility may put them at variance with the collective view of the Cabinet. His is an utterly fallacious argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond to the point that the hon. Member for Cathcart and I have raised, and which he has so far ignored. The Minister has gone on and on about how education and research will be taken into account. However, the principal of Glasgow university has said that there is nothing in the Bill to assure him that general managers will be assessed for the quality of training and research that they encourage, the Minister has only made assertions, which are not backed by legitimate guarantees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>498</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: the hon. Gentleman has used at least three confused arguments. Many people who are wiser than he would take issue with his view that Cabinet government involves each Minister sitting around the Cabinet table representing a Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cabinet government is about collective ministerial responsibility for the Government's entire programme, just as NHS trusts will be about collective responsibility for all aspects of the hospital or body concerned. The hon. Gentleman's analogy makes my point rather than his.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not also true that there is a difference in that the majority of people on the trust governing bodies will not treat it, as a way of enhancing their career, as a member of Parliament might treat a Cabinet post?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend tempts me down roads that I think will lead me into trouble. Therefore, I shall not reply to that point.

I do not understand why amendment No. 424 has been tabled. I took it to be a mistake. It would ensure that employees of universities, or of medical or dental schools could work for NHS trusts only within the limits of their contract of employment. That would make it difficult for academics to enter into honourary consultant contracts with NHS trust. The Health Service benefits from such unpaid work by academics. As the Government are strongly committed to the preservation of research and training, I am baffled by the support that has been given to an amendment that would only hinder such progress. I am sure that the hon. Member for Cathcart will, on reflection, wish to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->

When the Conservative party chairman in Scotland was the Minister in charge of health and education in Scotland he was responsible for the idea and implementation of the opt-out scheme for schools. The Minister and his hon. Friends used one argument throughout the passage of that proposal, which was that if all Scots were opposed to schools opting out the Opposition need not worry as schools would remain under authority control because of the ballot system. Why is he now opposed to similar ballots on hospitals? If he will give me an assurance that ballots will be introduced, I shall sit down and say no more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must nail that canard once and for all. I have raised the matter before and no Opposition Member has been able to answer me. I served on the Committee that considered the opt-out scheme, with my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland. The hon. Gentleman cannot sustain the argument that it is possible to have ballots on whether hospitals should opt out when it is impossible to identify who should have a vote—past, present or future patients, staff, GPs, people living in the immediate or further community. He cannot answer that and must not keep repeating the false analogy between ballots for hospitals and schools. It does not add up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to do so. Our arguments were forcefully and well put in the original debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, someone must stimulate the decision for a hospital to opt out. I emphasise that in Scotland it is what is in the Bill and the Act that matters. As drafted, the only person who can institute an NHS trust in Scotland is the Secretary of State for Scotland. But nothing in the Bill describes how the process will even be started.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This reminds me of the Committee examining the Self-Governing Schools etc. (Scotland) Bill when we asked the question time and again and answer there came none. The amendments list a variety of interest groups that might be balloted. Which one would the hon. Gentleman wish to commend to the Committee? Moreover, will he answer the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) that there is no natural constituency that can be balloted? Whom would he seek to ballot?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments refer to a variety of groups because different circumstances apply in differ-
	<span class='label label-info column'>500</span>
ent hospitals. If a hospital in Stornaway, Orkney or Shetland or a small cottage hospital on the Isle of Arran wanted to opt out, the people living there would be the obvious choice; no one else uses those hospitals but the people of the islands. In a big city hospital, it may well be the patients. But in all cases, as a bare minimum, the medical staff should be consulted and should give their consent. They and the rest of the staff work there. Surely they should have the right to be consulted. If they say no, it should not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister is exerting pressure. There is one hospital, which I shall not name because the people who spoke to me are frightened of the Minister and of how he will use his influence against them in their career structure. In that hospital, the result of a vote of the consultants—only the consultants—was 40:4 against, even seeking further information. It was not that they voted against the idea, they did not even want to seek further information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But one consultant has written an official letter to the health board, asking whether the hospital could be considered as an NHS trust. Given this Minister's way of operating, it is highly likely that that letter will be taken as an approach to him to start the process of that hospital becoming an NHS trust. That is how he operates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Balloting may not be the right way, but a consultation process must be incorporated into the Act before anyone in Scotland will be satisfied. Nobody in Scotland wants the Bill and Scotland's hospitals do not want it, with the exception of two and, even then, the view is simply that of the administration; one hospital is threatened with closure and only the administrators of the other, not the doctors, have expressed interest. No one in Scottish hospitals wants the measure. Will the Minister impose it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper says that two major hospitals will be out before 1992 and 30 thereafter. But suppose that hospitals do not want that; is the Minister telling us today that he will impose the measure on Scotland's hospitals without the consent of people in Scotland, patients and those who work in its hospitals? If so, let him say it loud and clear so that people in Scotland will know the truth, that he is the dictator of the Scottish Health Service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister's decision will not be democratic in the consultative sense or in recording the verdict of the public, patients and professionals who will be affected by proposals for a hospital to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process is even more ludicrous in Scotland than elsewhere. The last report I read stated that possibly two hospitals will opt out no doubt having a carrot dangled in front of them and being offered every conceivable inducement. It is ludicrous to even talk about hospitals opting out because of the geography of Scotland. The core services are ill-defined and there are so few guarantees, not least of maternity provisions. The Bill is even more alien to the interests of Scotland and the attitudes of Scots than other legislation introduced by this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's standing in the Scottish polls is low and they have few Scottish MPs. They should show some humility, recognise the political reality and accept the amendments. Scots must have a voice in deciding the future of their Health Service. It does not belong to the Scottish Office, it belongs to the Scottish people. It is disgraceful that the Bill will allow parts of the Health Service to opt out and to inconvenience the people of Scotland without consulting them democratically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

mittee, we shall call the Gainsborough question, asked in another Committee, by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). The Gainsborough question is, "Which amendment do you want?" Amendment No. 404 requires that before a hospital becomes a self-governing NHS trust, there should be a ballot of the medical staff. Amendment No. 406 requires a ballot of the patients or their guardians who had been treated in a hospital in the previous five years. Amendment No. 407 requires a ballot of the hospital's employees and admendment No. 413 requires people living in the area served by the hospital to vote. I am a reasonable man. Will the hon. Member for Cathcart tell me which amendment he prefers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I accepted amendment No. 404, which specifies medical staff, the nurses and ancillary workers would be excluded. What would NUPE and COHSE say about that? Why take one group and not the others? The answer is that the hon. Gentleman is prepared to say almost anything to oppose the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Leigh</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is rather as if, during consideration of the Self-Governing Schools etc, (Scotland) Bill, my hon. Friend had accepted an amendment that proposed that the old boys association, the teachers, the children or the parents should have the veto. The amendments are absurd. The Opposition are saying that one section of the community should have a veto but not the rest. The hon. Gentleman Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) cannot sustain his argument and he knows it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It would be sensible to give everyone the opportunity to express a view on a proposal for an NHS trust and to consult. That is precisely what the Government propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already said that paragraphs 6.9 to 6.12 of the Scottish Working Paper "Self-governing Hospitals—An initial guide" set out our policy on consultation. It is a fascinating document, which makes excellent bedtime reading. The hon. Gentleman should take it home and read it over the weekend. Ballots would be ridiculous. Even the hon. Member for Cathcart cannot define the constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be fair to the hon. Gentleman, if I had been asked the question that I put to him, I would have argued for the widest possible group. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) asked earlier how one would deal with a hospital such as Stracathro, which takes patients from a vast area.

that are built into the working papers. They are fine, but do they give a guarantee of the extent to which the Secretary of State will be guided by the balance of opinion sumbitted to him on a specific proposal to opt out? Even when 99.9 per cent. vote against opting out, it is quite possible for the Secretary of State, and especially this Minister, to decide to go ahead for ideological reasons. It makes nonsence of consultation, and the Minister knows it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that the hon. Gentleman is abandoning his argument in favour of balance, because he is now arguing about the way in which a consultation exercise will be evaluated by the Secretary of State. He is, or course, right to focus on that. He has perceived that it will not involve simple yes or no questions, because giving a hospital self-governing status as a NHS trust is a serious matter and involves many issues of management, administration and details on which assurances will be needed. Therefore, it is appropriate to allow people to make submissions on the basis of reasoned argument and discussion with a view to ensuring the best interests of patients, rather than on the basis described by the hon. Member for Ross, Cromarty and Skye, of consultants who were voting against even having further information. The amendments are ridiculous because the applications are complex and need to be considered as part of a wider consultation exercise. They would give one group a power of veto over a trust application, and that would be inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Opposition's continual theme has been that there should be ballots, it is surprising to have reached this stage of our deliberations without having heard any practical arguments about how they see the policy being implemented. It is a luxury that Oppositions enjoy, but if they behave as they are doing, they will remain in Opposition. I suggest that the hon.

He makes cheap, debating points and they are not worthy of a Minister. If he listens to the replies given by his English colleagues who, although they may not be the greatest of Ministers, at least reply to the general points that have been raised in debate and do not just read a brief. If advisers wrote what he said, they are taking a political role, and that is disgraceful. The Minister should wake up.

The people of Scotland want to know the answer to one question, and the amendments were designed to elicit the answer from the Minister, but failed. The question is: If the mass of patients, populace, hospital workers, even consultants do not want to be part of an NHS trust, will the Minister go ahead anyway? The Minister fails to answer because he knows that ultimately, despite all his so-called consultation, he will force it on certain hospitals in Scotland, whether they and their employees like it or not. Despite that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"All the non executive-directors will be chosen for the contribution they personally can make to the effective management of the hospital and not for any interest groups they might represent.

Page 27.3.17 of the White Paper states that an esential condition of having a NHS trust is that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Senior professional staff, especially consultants must be involved in the management of the hospital."</p></blockquote>
That is a prerequisite, and presumably a continuing part of having a NHS trust. Is the Minister saying that a consultant working in an NHS trust who is a member of the BMA or of any other professional organisation which negotiates and pays doctors, will not be allowed

	<span class='label label-info column'>505</span>
to be a member of the board and will not be appointed to it as a non-executive director even if one may be appointed as an executive director? The Minister has a responsibilty, in responding to the amendments, to spell out briefly who he expects to be on these boards. I should like it even in Scottish terms. The establishment of Scotland is only a small community. I should like him to name a few names and say, for instance, who the Secretary of State would appoint as directors if one of the major hospitals in Glasgow decided to opt out. It would be interesting to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The White Paper says that two major hospitals in Scotland are expected to have become NHS trusts by 1992. Judging by the opinion polls, the general election will be in 1992. Therefore he will be in a position to tell us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As usual, the hon. Gentleman's logic is appalling. He will recall mentioning the city of Glasgow. It is true that we expect two hospitals there to be self governing by 1992. The hon. Gentleman may know something that I do not but I am not in a position to commit myself by saying that one of those hospitals will be in Glasgow. The hon. Gentleman asks a different question. I take it that he concedes the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is clear. The trust's non-executive directors will appoint executive directors of the trusts. If there are to be two grades of director, it is important that they work as a harmonious team. Therefore, it would be ridiculous to accept amendments that would result in a board of directors being composed partly of appointees and partly of members elected by the staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me to define the BMA. I am tempted to give a frank answer. My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) suggested that it was a trade union. The association performs a variety of roles. When I refer to it as a trade union, its members get upset. From my perspective, it behaves like a trade union from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart is aware that in our proposals for NHS trusts there will be nothing to prevent consultants becoming directors. What is not desirable is their being non-executive directors if they are employed by a trust. That exclusion, which has nothing to do with whether they were members of the BMA, because many doctors are not, would apply.

I accept that the use of the word "assure" may have been misguided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish people are worried that because some hospitals will work as commercial operations, some services will go. The Under-Secretary of State for Health made it clear that it would be necessary to achieve a certain margin on capital investments, and in many instances pay some staff much more to attract the right people. The people of Scotland are worried about high-tech cheaper operations. These can be put through quickly—one person coming in for an operation one night and going out the following day. People fear that they will become usual practice because hospitals can charge the health board a higher price for them whereas long-term, perhaps geriatric, patients with a long-running ailment which will involve a long-term hospital stay will not be welcome because it is difficult to charge a high price for them. Such patients will be expensive to keep in hospital and the hospital will find it difficult to cover its expenses. That is one of the dangers that people fear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All I ask is that the Minister tell us that the Bill either by amendment now or later with an amendment from him in some form, will ensure that a hospital's functions will not result in a deterioration in either the number or quality of services it provides to a community. Quality is important. If the cost of putting someone through hospital is a major consideration, patients will be taken in, operated on and pushed out far too quickly and before they are fit to leave. That is a danger and a threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to correct me. We can enter the steam age but we are still required to shoe the horses and travel in hansom cabs. That is the effect of the amendment. What the hon. Gentleman does not realise is that if the NHS is required to retain everything, it will have no money to enter the age of steam. That is why the amendment is vintage Socialism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would place a ludicrous and unnecessary restriction on the freedom of NHS trusts to order their own affairs. Furthermore, it goes to the heart of the Opposition's opposition to the Bill. They cannot stand the idea that hospitals should be able to take decisions about themselves and their services to patients. Hospitals will operate under contract and will have to provide a range of services, as determined by the health board. The amendment would prevent them from doing that to the best of their ability, which is the hon. Gentleman's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While the Minister is on the subject of services and future provision, I shall tell the Committee a joke about Rumania. The Minister has accused the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why no guarantee could be given on the provision of maternity, or other services that might be care services in some areas. Guarantees will be given. There will be a duty on health boards to ensure that a range of services are provided in their area. The hon. Gentleman is confusing two things, which shows that he does not understand what the Bill is about. The golden thread running through the Bill is the separation of purchaser and provider. NHS trusts are about providing, and as providers they will be required to provide whetever services they are contracted by the health board to do. That could include maternity services if the health board believes that that service is appropriate for its area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary. It restricts the freedom of NHS trusts and it would inhibit their aiblity to

We do not know which services will be guaranteed in hospitals, because the decisions will be left entirely to the health boards. I am opposed to individual hospitals operating as individual units on their own. I believe in a combined, co-operative Health Service, where hospitals work with other hospitals, and health centres work with hospitals, and a range of functions is performed, thus providing an integrated service. That is how it should be. To have individual hospitals trying to operate on their own is not the way forward. I do not consider that the Minister has given a guarantee.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments repeat our earlier debate on the conditions of service and pay of those employed in NHS trusts. My hon. Friends advanced the arguments extremely well this morning. I want to say only that the experience in Scotland of the privatisation of many operations in the Health Service and local government shows already a deterioration in employees' wages and conditions. We fear that the same will happen as a reesult of this measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule appears to permit NHS trusts to negotiate whatever terms and conditions they choose. There is no, or very little, spill-over from employees' previous employment. The trusts will even be able to tear up people's pension schemes and order them into new ones. That is appalling. In the remote parts of Scotland there is plenty of cheap labour for menial tasks, but a crying need for skilled labour, including doctors. I foresee that the salaries of doctors and nurses will rise, but those of cleaners, porters and the others who do essential work in hospitals will be pushed down further and further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me cite an example from the Western Infirmary in Glasgow, not from the Western Isles, where porters, who are an essential part of the service, are paid £50 a week by the new privatised companies. Many could get as much if they were unemployed, but because they have a pride in working and know that they have a better chance of getting another job as a result, they accept such jobs.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The higher paid will be even better paid and the lower paid will have their wages reduced. That is why we want to retain the same standards under national negotiations in the trusts that exist in the NHS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cath-cart refused to give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Hayes) although he made many false accusations. He said that he would not rehearse the arguments that his hon. Friends had advanced already on the parts of the Bill applying to England and Wales. I should have thought that he would listen to what my hon. Friends said in response and so be aware that it is wrong to suggest that pension schemes would be torn up and that people would lose the rights guaranteed to them under other legislation. Those remarks could cause needless anxiety to people in the Health Service and I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman will withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 17(1) of schedule 6 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Without prejudice to the generality of paragraph 16"—</p></blockquote>
which is to employ staff as the trust thinks fit—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to or in respect of such of its employees as it may determine, an NHS trust may make such arrangements for providing pensions, allowances or gratuities as it may determine".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>510</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know that that is a permissive power allowing an NHS trust to establish its own schemes, which might well be better. He told the Committee that people who were transferred to an NHS trust would lose their existing rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They may do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman can quote from the schedule or any part of the Bill where it says that employees may lose their existing rights, I shall gladly give way to him. He will not find it. Several times this morning my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Health explained employment and pension rights. He made it clear that people transferred to NHS trusts would retain those rights that are not in jeopardy. It is nothing less than wicked of the hon. Gentleman to go around suggesting otherwise. The Bill provides for NHS trusts to make their own arrangements. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to represent the interests of the employees in the Health Service, whose role I accept is crucial, he should welcome the Bill. It does not seem to have occurred to him that NHS trusts might provide better health provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debates today, Labour Members have actually argued, along the lines of the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), that one consequence of the Bill might be that doctors will be paid more. It is possible that porters might be paid more too. The hon. Gentleman also complained about competitive tendering, but I noticed that he talked about income, not wage levels, which are determined by Whitley. In Scotland, competitive tendering brought in savings of about £10,000 a year when I started my present job. It is now saving £62 million, but of course the hon. Gentleman failed to point that out. That saving is money available to health boards for improving services. I recently answered a parliamentary question and gave specific examples of how that money has been deployed. More doctors and nurses have been employed and new units built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the credit of the work force, the achievements have not been done by private contractors. Three quarters of the savings have come from the same in-house workers—members of NUPE and COHSE—who—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I cannot recommend the amendments to the Committee. They are totally inappropriate, and reveal the real nature of Opposition Members. They require that staff organisations agree to transferral schemes, and do not give a power of veto to staff. Only a few minutes ago, we heard the hon. Member for Cathcart arguing the case for democracy and wider interests, yet the amendments confer a power of veto to representatives, not to the staff. Moreover, only officially recognised staff representatives are worth consulting, not the others. In cases where hospitals and units have representatives that are not recognised by Whitley—if, say, an ad hoc group had been formed—they would be excluded. Therefore, we are dealing with trade union

amendments, which favour the interests of neither staff nor patient care. I have no hesitation in suggesting that the hon. Gentleman withdraw them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The history of the past 100 years sugg-gests that staff—especially low-paid staff—need trade unions to protect them from the worst employers—of whom the Minister is one. I served on the Standing Committees that considered the Electricity Bill in 1989 and the British Steel Bill in 1988.1 have also served on other Committees considering Bills which involved the transfer of staff from one employer to another involved. That is what we are dealing with here. Every such Bill included long schedules about the protection and safeguarding of members, pension rights. This Bill does not. Nothing in it protects employees in the Health Service in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should be aware that the Bill is about the Health Service. He should read the Bill and its provisions. He knows that the guarantees that he seeks are in employment and pensions legislations and, because they are not affected by this Bill, the rights are retained. The hon. Gentleman should recognise that. 1 should have thought that that point was made on all those Committees on which he sat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether the Minister likes it or not, we are discussing the transfer of employment from one employer to another. Whether the new employer is on the fringes of the Health Service is irrelevant. The NHS will no longer be the employer of anyone working in an NHS trust hospital. That is clear from the legislation. That is why it should contain safeguards to protect Health Service employees. Those safeguards are not there and Health Service employees are gravely worried about that. That is why we tabled the amendments, and rightly so. Because of the hour, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
