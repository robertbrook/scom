	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Farm and Conservation Grant (Variation) Scheme 1996 (S.I. 1996, No. 230).</p></blockquote>
May I express my pleasure, Mr. Hicks, at seeing you in the Chair so immaculately turned out? It is St. David's day on Friday, and you are wearing a daffodil—that wonderful emblem of Wales. I envy other members of the Committee who may .have attended today's gathering in the Cholmondeley Room for St. David's day. Ministerial duties in Mold meant that I did not have the opportunity to be there, so I admit to having a naked lapel. However, St. David's day is not until Friday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the opportunity to present this short and, I trust, uncontroversial statutory instrument to the Committee. The Farm and Conservation Grant (Variation) Scheme 1996 was laid before Parliament on 9 February 1996, and it was considered, and passed, by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments on 13 February. The purpose of the scheme is to extend those elements of the farm and conservation grant scheme 1989 that remain extant for a further two years. It will enable capital grants for environmental and conservation measures to continue to be made available to farmers in Wales, until either 18 February 1998 or until such earlier time as alternative arrangements can be put in place to absorb remaining activities within other environmental and management schemes. I shall touch on that aspect later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful if I first explain the background to the farm and conservation grant scheme, which was launched on 20 February 1989, using powers contained in sections 28 and 29 of the Agriculture Act 1970. Those powers restricted the operation of the 1989 scheme to a period of seven years, unless extended by further schemes made under the same powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various elements of the 1989 scheme have been withdrawn over the intervening years. What remains is a valuable combination of features that will continue to attract grant aid. They range from the provision, replacement or improvement of shelter belts for shading stock, the enclosure of grazed woodland to encourage regrowth by excluding livestock and the renovation of traditional boundaries such as hedges and stone walls. They will cover grants for the provision of stiles, gates and way markings for public access and opportunities for the control of bracken and heather. Finally, they will include grants for the repair and renovation of traditional agricultural buildings, using materials that are traditional to the locality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure provides for grants at rates varying between 15 per cent. to 40 per cent., depending upon
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
whether activity takes place on land designated as either outside or inside a less favoured area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequences of extending the farm and conservation grant scheme in Wales would allow other schemes that in part use the same legislation to continue until other arrangements may be made. Those include capital grants for fencing under the water fringe, coastal belt and broadleaved woodland elements of the habitat scheme and the countryside access scheme. Similarly, provisions for bracken control and fencing can be applied under the moorland scheme. In addition, the Countryside Council for Wales uses the legislation for the hedgerow renovation scheme when that operates outside the three pilot Tir Cymen areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office will continue to examine all opportunities to achieve simplification in the range of schemes on offer, and to ensure that they are well focused and, wherever possible, integrated. As part of the process, the Welsh Office will, in the course of 1996, review the overall provision of various schemes so as to ensure their cohesive delivery and value for money. That will include the integration of remaining grants available under the farm and conservation grant scheme with other suitable mechanisms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme has a knock-on effect on rural employment in terms of contract work and other employment opportunities associated with undertaking these measures. Similarly, the rural landscape is rendered more attractive by investment on traditional buildings. Positive environmental management also benefits the tourism industry. The farming industry in Wales has welcomed the scheme's continuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no public expenditure implications associated with the order. Resources to pay grants exist already within the overall provision for the farm and conservation grant scheme. No additional bids are therefore necessary. I commend the scheme to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.34 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I add my welcome to you, Mr. Hicks, for being selected from the Chairmen's Panel to chair this debate. I congratulate you also on your choice of lapel wear for the day. It matches mine, which tends to roll over because of the inadequacies of its pin. I trust that you will draw that to my attention, if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a fellow Celt, Mr. Hicks, it is appropriate that you are chairing the Committee. I am sure that you agree that it would be as well if we got rid of the meaningless Oxbridge claptrap of referring to each other as hon. Members. Perhaps we should just say "me 'andsome" whenever we want to address another member of the Committee. However, that might prevent you from being selected again, so I will not take it too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers in Wales want to know why the Welsh Office waited until the previous scheme had virtually expired before renewing it. That has had a considerable effect on the implementation of the old scheme, because people were not assured that there would be an extended scheme. I hope that I can persuade the Minister to get back on his feet after I have spoken—and after others have sought to catch your eye, Mr. Hicks—and explain whether the Welsh Office feels a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0335">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
sense of shame about having left farmers and its civil servants dangling during the past six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office made verbal promises to the farming unions and other organisations that the scheme would be continued, but as the new scheme did not appear, farmers thought that they should rush to make applications. They were not always well thought out, and divisional officers of the Welsh Office Agriculture Department said, "This may not be the greatest scheme that we have ever heard of, but we do not want to be unfair to the farmers." They were not absolutely certain that there would be a follow-on scheme, so they made decisions on the applications rather than saying to the farmers, "Wait until you know for certain that there will be a follow-on scheme for a further two years, then you can submit a well-thought-out application."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having well-thought-out schemes is at the heart of good conservation of the countryside, which involves the use of traditional materials in agricultural buildings such as old barns and byres, and hedging and walling, shelter belts, enclosing grazed woodlands, controlling bracken expansion and so on. It is essential that those schemes are well thought out in conservation and agricultural terms. Rushed schemes are not a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The major criticism is that renewing the scheme took an inordinate length of time. We all agree about the merits of the schemes and that by 1998, there will be a need for a proper quinquennial review of the Tir Cymen and the environmentally sensitive area legislation. The rates of grant in less favoured areas, sensitive areas and Tir Cymen will have to be co-ordinated properly. In taking an inordinate length of time to reassure people that there would be a follow-up scheme, the Minister and his Department can accurately be described as having let down the farmers of Wales, who were interested in playing their part. That put the civil servants and farmers under unnecessary pressure. They were informally advised that there would be a follow-up scheme, but that promise needed to be turned into reality several months ago. It is highly unsatisfactory that farmers and civil servants were forced to rush applications and their consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad, but perhaps inevitable, that in this case Wales is one year behind England—that is not a general comment on Wales and England. It happens that the countryside stewardship scheme came in five years ago and the Tir Cymen scheme was introduced four years ago. Obviously, farmers in Wales tend to look across the border and ask, "If we lived in England, would the scheme have been renewed so that we could make our applications after due consideration and with plenty of time to seek advice from civil servants in WODE?" The answer is yes, because the countryside stewardship scheme, although its rules are different, has been renewed. It is only today—late in the day—that this scheme is being extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another puzzle that I hope the Minister will solve is whether, as farmers suspect, the reason for the delay is that the Welsh Office was not sure whether it should try comprehensively to review the whole issue of conservation-related grants on farms by bringing together ESA, LFA and Tir Cymen schemes or simply extend what we have now and perform that major review in two years. Their inability to decide whether to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
have a comprehensive review or an extension meant that the extension was left until late in the day, which was unfair and incompetent. I do not want to be too hard on the Minister or the Welsh Office Agriculture Department. However, I have tried to convey accurately to the Minister the feelings of fanners in Wales, especially those who want to protect and proficiently farm the countryside. They also want to ensure that the most attractive aspect of the countryside is presented to townspeople, including my constituents, who enjoy playing their part in the countryside. Farmers also want to play their part by restoring hedges, banks and old stone barns, and byres. To do so, however, they expect a reasonable amount of notice from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) asked me to send his apologies to the Committee. He had hoped to be here this afternoon, but, obviously, problems associated with the Sea Empress incident kept him away. He wanted to discuss that feature of Pembrokeshire that is a hybrid of a hedge and a bank, and which is known—logically enough—as the hedgebank. Although my hon. Friend is unable to attend the Committee, he wanted to ensure, on behalf of his constituents, that Pembrokeshire's hedgebanks are incorporated into the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.41 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to disappoint our Celtic cousins, but I suspect that the reason that you, Mr. Hicks, and I are wearing daffodils is because we support the relevant charity and because we want to advertise the fact that Cornish daffodils are already in full bloom and that other parts of the country, sadly, are way behind us in climatic terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, of course, aware of the concerns of our friends in the Principality. As was said earlier, the proposed extension of the scheme mainly concerns Wales. We should recognise, however, that the extension should be viewed in the context of an overall approach to conservation on farms, and that it is therefore relevant to efforts to assist farmers in other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us were struck by the fact that in the White Paper on rural policy—which might more accurately be described as a Green Paper—mention was made of such schemes. No doubt a Welsh version of the White Paper will appear in due course. The White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is probable therefore that there will be a continuing and perhaps increasing need for incentive schemes with specific environmental objectives. We would like to see part of the savings from the reductions in production-oriented support made available for this purpose."</p></blockquote>
Sadly, however, those schemes give no such encouragement. A diminishing proportion of the total agricultural budget is used for conservation objectives on farms. Those of us who are concerned about the way that agricultural support systems will develop in future are worried about the way that the overall structure of the support system is developing. It seems that neither the White Paper's promise nor the interests of the taxpaying public are being met. However, the proposed extension of the scheme is a modest improvement on the situation that appeared to be developing. As the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) said, the extension has been introduced at the last minute. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0336">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
none the less welcome. A reprieve is always welcome, although it has caused problems for Welsh farmers who did not know what would happen next.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anxieties have been expressed about the limitations that will result. For example, fanners who have already claimed a grant for effluent disposal facilities, which are extremely important in the dairy and the beef sectors, are worried whether their claims will be disallowed immediately: I believe that they will be. There seems to be a good case for granting a reprieve to those farmers—important environmental consequences would follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the longer term, the abolition of grant aid for effluent disposal is an important matter in Wales and in other parts of the country. Members who represent farming areas know that the tendency has been that while grant was available, those who already had money in the bank were able to make progress with regard to the development of waste water facilities, but those who had no financial support to fall back on were denied any help from grant aid. That issue will have to be revisited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, the powerful advocacy for the scheme's value and for the way in which it is to be varied should be applied this side of Offa's Dyke. I am sure that all hon. Members agree that the Minister made an excellent case for the scheme, but, while we endorse and support his rationale, those of us who represent constituencies in other parts of the United Kingdom must ask, "Why not us?" We all support the concept of subsidiarity for different parts of the United Kingdom, but the onus should be on Ministers to explain why the Welsh are entitled to special treatment, when the same logic is not to be applied elsewhere. I hope that the Minister will indicate that he is prepared to raise that issue with his colleagues in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While there is to be a transition to the countryside stewardship scheme in other parts of the United Kingdom in due course, we have yet to hear whether the criteria and qualifications are to be as convenient and favourable to farmers as those under the farm and conservation grant scheme. It would appear that greater complexity and more onerous and restrictive conditions are to be the order of the day. That might discourage farmers from undertaking maintenance work on important and valuable conservation features.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All in all, you and I, Mr. Hicks, might be forgiven for having the green eyes of jealousy when we look at what is to continue across the border—albeit for only two years—on the ground that we are to be denied a simple, cost-effective scheme. Even if the Minister cannot give explicit assurances in respect of other parts of the country, I hope that he will convey the views of members of the Committee to his colleagues in MAFF.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. John Marek 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wrexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) talked about extending the scheme to England, he might have had more success if Conservative Members had been jumping up and down urging that course of action on
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the Minister. However, they look bored—some are doing their correspondence—and they are all from England. As usual, the Government have found a Minister to come along and present the scheme, but everyone else on the Conservative Benches is from somewhere other than Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that when we have a Welsh Parliament, we will not have any nonsense about English Members of Parliament telling Welsh Members of Parliament here in Westminster that we should not vote on English matters. Clearly, in this Committee, it is the hon. Members from England who are voting on Welsh matters. That happens habitually, Mr. Hicks. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] I would be happy to give way to the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman). Unfortunately, I did not hear his sedentary comment, otherwise I should have replied to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we are straying from the terms of the statutory instrument, which are the subject of our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we might be, Mr. Hicks. I shall get back to the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister two questions. Why is the scheme being introduced now? It seems to be a stop-gap measure. I have looked at Statutory Instrument 1989/128, paragraph 7 of which is headed:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Closing dates for claims and incurring certain expenditure."</p></blockquote>
A different form of payment has continued in England, but it could be argued that the scheme being introduced is a patch-up job on a scheme that was supposed to end. The Government should introduce a fresh scheme, making new environmental grants available to farmers. Instead, there is to be an extension for one section of the population of the grants available under SI 1989/128. Will the Minister tell us whether that is because the Government do not have enough people to do the work, and a comprehensive set of regulations are to be introduced as part of their review? Or is it that the Government intend to do little or nothing as a result of the review, if they believe that the farming community in Wales will allow such inaction?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question has already been touched on by the hon. Member for North Cornwall. It is to do with the grants for effluents disposal, which have ceased. However, there is concern that claims may have been made. Like the hon. Member for North Cornwall, I believe it would be useful if the Minister would say whether claims that have been made will be paid when the work is done. For example, there has been a lot of snow recently. My garden was covered by a foot of snow two weeks ago, and there is no chance of any daffodils for another two or three weeks. No doubt, the weather has been much worse in the hills of Wales. I would not like anyone to forego any grant as a result of an administrative slip-up by the Welsh Office. Some assurance from the Minister would be useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My farmers welcome the extension of the grant, although they are less happy about the delay in announcing it. As a result of the delay, there has been a great rush of applications. Until the announcement, there were only rumours, whispers and off-the-record comments about a possible extension of the scheme, but nothing formal. Something should have been done last autumn and, as a result, the Government have caused a bottleneck, which means that my farmers face long waits for their grants. They are already waiting for all sorts of grants—one of their continual complaints. In' addition, we hear that there will be a further 11 per cent. cut in funding for the agriculture department of the Welsh Office. I hate to think what the situation will be when that is implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My farmers would like the real benefits of Tir Cymen to be extended throughout Wales. Admittedly, it is better than the English countryside stewardship scheme, but it is available only in some small areas of Wales. It would be an excellent idea to extend it, and I am sure that Welsh farmers would appreciate that greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Cornwall mentioned grant aid for effluent disposal. I believe that the grant was cut simply because the Government could not afford it because effluent disposal is, by nature, a costly task with no direct return for the investment by the farmer or the Government. However, there is an indirect return for the Government in terms of reduced pollution and reduced clear-up costs, which are a direct cost for the National Rivers Authority and the Government. Therein lies yet another paradox for the Government. The grant promotes anti-pollution but it deliberately removes the farmers' mechanism for dealing with effluent. I hope the Minister appreciates that while it is good to extend the grant scheme, we should be considering a much more comprehensive system along the lines of Tir Cymen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Committee for indicating that it welcomes the continuation of the scheme for two years. To dispose of the point raised by the hon. Member for Wrexham (Dr. Marek), I cannot share the idea that English Members should not take part in the debate. I am pleased to see Mr. Hicks in the Chair and the hon. Member for North Cornwall in Committee. We get awfully prickly in Wales about that subject. During the last Welsh debate in the House, the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) objected to English Members being present. I had to remind him that, in the same debate in the previous year, he sent the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) as his substitute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to appear prickly, Mr. Hicks, but I do not think that you and I would wish to be described as English. We are Celts and we come from Cornwall, which is a distinct identity, as I am sure the Minister would agree, and a very old Celtic kingdom—actually rather older than the Principality of Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister resumes, I urge members of the Committee to return to the terms of the statutory instrument that we are discussing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman says. I appreciate Celtic affinity.

The hon. Member for Cardiff, West and other hon. Members were worried about the date of the scheme's introduction. I do not accept the near panic that he suggested in the matter, either on his part or among farmers in Wales. That is not the impression that I gained from my contacts with farming unions and farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various understandable considerations have been necessary before today's consideration of the statutory instrument. Administrative matters must be considered and a consideration of the cost of extending the scheme in its present form for a further two years is not irrelevant. I do not accept that the procedure was highly unsatisfactory. It was not carried out within the spirit of the 21-day rule required for negative resolutions, but the negative resolution procedure is not being used. We have acted in due time to ensure continuity and no break between one scheme and the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not justifiable to say that we have been unable to decide. The statutory instrument allows us to extend the scheme. We shall then be able to consider the totality of the various schemes involved. I have previously announced that the Tir Cymen pilot scheme will not end until the spring of next year. I said when making that announcement that we wanted to consider Tir Cymen and other schemes before that scheme came to an end. We want to give proper consideration to the overall provision to ensure cohesiveness. When we review the schemes, we intend to consult widely with all the interested parties in Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Cornwall mentioned the rural White Paper for England that has been published. Without anticipating its contents, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that we shall shortly publish a rural White Paper for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for North Cornwall and for Clwyd, South-West (Mr. Jones) were concerned about waste-handling facilities. That issue is well past. Under the 1980 scheme, submissions could be accepted up to and including 19 February 1996 if proof provided by farmers of expenditure incurred before 30 November 1994. We are now well beyond that cut-off point. Carrying that forward now would result in Welsh farmers receiving more favourable treatment than that accorded to their counterparts in the rest of Great Britain. That would not be acceptable. The issue is not solely one of cost. It was necessary to make progress. Farmers have taken the opportunity to make good progress on improving the situation and there is less instance of pollution. However, we had to move to a situation in which the polluter paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Hon. Member for North Cornwall mentioned the possibility of envy from his side of Offa's Dyke. What is done on one side of Offa's Dyke does not necessarily have to be replicated on the other side. We can operate different schemes, and people on one side of Offa's Dyke can learn from what is done on the other side. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will be quick to press any improvements to the countryside stewardship scheme on my colleagues at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. We are all trying to ensure the most appropriate arrangements for our farmers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not address the issue of the recent severe weather. Perhaps I am arguing about nothing. I agree that we should move towards the principle of the polluter paying, but it is possible that some work for which grant was claimed by November 1994 has not been completed because of the severe weather. Can the Minister help farmers who have been genuinely prevented from carrying out works by severe weather? Is it possible to grant a one or two-month extension? If the Minister can assure me that no fanners are in that situation, I shall not press the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The recent severe weather should not have made any material difference to expenditure incurred before 30 November 1994, which is almost 18 months ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman and I are as one in wanting the Welsh Office Agriculture Department to achieve the most timely service in meeting the claims of Welsh farmers. We published a farmers charter last year and are in the first period of its operation. We have undertaken to publish the results and are seeking to do our best to achieve all the targets set out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Marek</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be wrong, but I thought that farmers had to claim for grants by November 1994 but had an extra period in which to carry out the work. My understanding is that the payment of the grant, as opposed to the claim for the grant, could be at a much later date if the work had been carried out. If I have that wrong, I apologise. But it is just possible that some fanners, because of the recent severe weather, are in difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt that would apply in practice, but I am always prepared to reflect further. However, there should not be any difficulty because of the time involved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
