	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Shersby</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the draft Export Guarantees (Extension of Period) Order 1979.</p></blockquote>
I find myself in the slightly unusual position this morning, in the absence of the Under-Secretary of State for Trade, of assisting the Government in getting their business through. But the Opposition are pleased to support the Government on this order, and I only hope that my intervention in moving the motion is but events casting their shadows before them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again we are considering an order to renew the cost escalation scheme provided for under section 5 of the Export Guarantees and Overseas Investments Act 1978, which was a consolidation measure. The original Export Guarantees Amendment Act 1975 provided that the cost escalation scheme ran for two years initially, with provision for annual renewal thereafter. This order is the same as the two earlier ones, and extends the scheme for a further year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1978 Act empowered the Export Credits Guarantee Department to give a measure of cover against certain United Kingdom cost increases for capital goods contracts. The powers to operate the scheme last until 26 March 1979 under section 5(3) of the 1978 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that since the introduction of the scheme in 1975 11 guarantees have been issued for exports, with a total contract value of £246 million, and that a further eight cases involving contracts worth some £468 million are in active negotiation. The premium for this cover is payable annually on the amounts of eligible costs covered at a rate of £1 per hundred for each year of the period of cover and pro rata for part years. The cover is against United Kingdom cost increases on the eligible part of major capital goods contracts or complete pro-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
jects worth —2 million which have a manufacturing period of at least two years. Similar contracts for consultancy and other services may also be considered for this cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One major factor affecting our consideration of this year's order is that there cannot now be any question of cover being withheld as a sanction against companies which have not strictly enforced the Government's 5 per cent, pay policy. This was a matter which occupied the Committee considering last year's order. I feel that that is a good thing, and that Parliament has rightly decided against this type of sanction, which was both ineffective and, in many people's eyes, unconstitutional. It would certainly have hindered our exporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a happier note, 1979 marks the 60th anniversary—perhaps I should say "the diamond jubilee"—of the setting up of the ECGD. On behalf of my hon. Friends, I pay tribute to the work it has done in providing a service of export credit insurance for British manufacturers and merchants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost escalation scheme is only one small part of the ECGD's activities, and it is necessary because of the inflationary times in which we live. It is none the less welcome, and the Opposition give their full support to the continuation of the scheme for a further 12 months. We believe that a scheme that benefits exports is welcome, and this scheme comes well within that category.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could not help thinking as I looked at this year's order that it was possible that some of the guarantees that had been given, or, indeed, were in the pipeline, were in respect of capital goods contracts for countries troubled by very uncertain times—countries such as Iran—which have in the past been major customers for Britain and where our exporters have been extremely successful. Certainly, exporters who have to deal with Iran may well find that conditions are uncertain for a little time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are very familiar with the workings of this scheme. It is well known to Parliament. We believe that it is important and that it may be even more so if inflation increases in the months or years ahead. We hope that that will not be the case, but the scheme provides a valuable form of cover to British exporters. On behalf of the Opposition, I give it our full support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.36 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first apologise for the absence of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Trade. I am sure that in view of the inclement weather the Committee will understand why he is unable to be here. He is most assiduous in his duties. I appreciate the co-operative manner in which the opening speech in this short debate has been made by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 14 December 1978, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade announced the Government's intention to recommend to the House an extension for 12 months of the powers by which the Export Credits Guarantee Department administers the cost escalation scheme under section 5 of the Export Guarantees and Overseas Investment Act 1978. That decision was taken after a careful review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of the improvement in inflationary trends in the United Kingdom since the introduction of the scheme, and the continuing international pressures for withdrawal of the scheme, we took note of the very strong representations from industry generally, and the principal users in particular, that there is still a continuing need for this form of export insurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the scheme was introduced in February 1975 for a two-year period and has twice been extended by order of the House. At. that time, exporters of major capital goods and projects, who have to make provision in their contracts for cost increases over long forward periods, were finding it increasingly difficult to compete in the face of the reluctance of overseas buyers to accept open-ended price variation provisions in contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government introduced, the cost escalation scheme as a temporary measure to give a degree of confidence and protection to exporters faced with long manufacturing periods and high value capital goods contracts. Since its introduction, the scheme has been modified and simplified, and we have restricted it to large projects for capital goods of £2 million or more with a minimum delivery period of two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear the hon. Gentleman give some information on what he no doubt thought was the up-to-date position. Later figures are available, and I am sure that he and the Committee will be interested to hear them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
To date, 13 guarantees have been issued for contracts worth £315 million. A further eight contracts valued at £467 million have been awarded to British firms which expect to take up offers of cost escalation guarantees in the near future. In addition, £501 million of export orders have been won with the support of the scheme, even though in the end exporters have exercised the option not to take cover. We consider such indirect support equally valuable to our export effort. Judged by its objectives, the scheme can, I think, be regarded as having achieved its purpose. It has provided confidence and has enabled our exporters both to compete for and to win desirable export business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme was introduced as a temporary facility to give exporters a measure of protection during a time of high, rising and unpredictable inflation. The heavy end of industry still regards the; scheme as valuable in terms of a safety net in relation to its ability to quote fixed prices or acceptable price variation clause's. Those exporters who have used the scheme, restricted to a small number of companies, are involved in contracts which stretch far in excess of any measured forecast of inflationary trends, and they have pressed us to continue to make the scheme available as an insurance against the recurrence of high inflation. They have stressed that without it they will be less confident in bidding for new business. The confidence factor is, I think, important. On balance, therefore, the Government accept that, for the time being, the scheme is necessary to enable major capital goods exporters to compete effectively in world markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members may know, discussions continue in the GATT and the EEC about export inflation schemes. I want to stress that we co-operate fully in these discussions. I repeat what has been said on the two previous occasions when the Government have recomended the extension of these powers—that we shall continue to participate constructively in efforts to reach international agreement on the operation of cost escalation or similar Government schemes for the promotion of exports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, we are not the only exporting nation operating a cost escalation scheme. The French have done so for nearly 30 years and other countries have other methods of export assistance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
which in our view need to be considered in any discussions about the future of export inflation schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Experience so far supports our view of our scheme as more of an insurance cover against the risk of rising inflation in future years than a subsidy to exporters. It is of course difficult to predict with any accuracy the final cost of the scheme, dependent as it is on the demand for cover and future rates of inflation. The White Paper on Public Expenditure, Cmnd 7439, stated that we expected the cost of guarantees issued to date and commitments expected to be entered into before the expiry of current powers on 27 March 1979 to be £5 million. On currently available inflation projections, a further extension of the scheme to 26th March 1980 is not expected to add to the cost. In fact, if inflation rates remain stable, additional business should reduce the overall cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will endorse the Government's view of the desirability of a further extension of the powers to operate the scheme, which has, I think, made a modest but not unimportant contribution to this crucial sector of our exporting industry. I very much appreciate the welcome given to the order by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Shersby).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.42 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ben Ford</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the order, and wish particularly to refer to the ECGD scheme in the context of the woollen textile industry, which has such a large influence in my constituency. The scheme has enabled the industry to ply its trade and to export a total of over £400 million-worth of goods in the past trading year. That is a tribute both to the industry and to the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a few general remarks about the scheme and to put forward some views which I hope the Government will note, although I do not expect a reply this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I direct the Committee's attention to the Latin American area in particular. The Government have withdrawn the ECGD
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
facility for people trading with certain countries throughout the world, and in particular in Latin America, principally for ideological reasons. That is perfectly understandable, and I have supported them in so doing. However, I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that we have in so doing lost some extremely large orders, particularly for railway equipment, mining equipment and so on, which would have provided a great deal of employment in this country and certainly in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My principal purpose is to ask the Government to keep these matters under careful review, because changes do take place. Regimes do mellow, as we saw in Spain. Therefore, I hope that as soon as it is practicable and morally proper the Government will reintroduce such schemes, so that we may get on with the proper business of trading with the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.44 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford) has said is a matter of record and will be reported to my hon. Friend the Minister. He is absolutely right. We are in a changing world. Therefore, it is only proper that the Government should keep these matters under constant review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share my hon. Friend's hope that conditions will change in the not too distant future, so that the Government will be able to give their support, particularly to his constituents. He mentioned in particular his constituents' interests and he was right to do so. Their only hope is that the Government will be able to make the kind of changes which will be beneficial to them in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
