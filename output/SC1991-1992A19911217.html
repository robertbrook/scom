	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Transport and Works Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Shipping (Mr. Patrick McLoughiin)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the further proceedings of the Transport and Works Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and with effect from Thursday at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
In moving the motion, I am not criticising any members of the Committee for their speeches. I simply want to ensure that progress is made on the Bill. In our two sittings, we have dealt with two clauses. There is interest in the Bill and we need to sit in the afternoons to allow all members of the Committee to express their opinions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Joan Walley 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stoke-on-Trent, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to respond briefly to the Minister's comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members feel that it is imperative that the Minister offer some concessions, not least on inland waterways, which have been included in the Bill without consultation. The Minister now wants to speed up our proceedings and move to evening sittings. That worries us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Cryer 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is scandalous that the Minister has moved the motion when the Committee has sat for only a week. Useful speeches have been made by members on both sides of the Committee. The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate), who has made most of the speeches from the Conservative Benches, was a member of the Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure. That Joint Committee recommended that the private Bill procedure in respect of railways should be improved and speeded up. To allow the Bill to be pushed through its Committee stage without giving hon. Members time to make a contribution would go against the views that the hon. Gentleman expressed in the Joint Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is rushing his fences. The Bill is not required urgently—unless, of course, the Minister has information about a general election at the beginning of the year and wants to get it enacted. The McLoughiin Bill may be his only contribution to parliamentary proceedings. If that is the reason, it seems to be a trivial one, as more important considerations should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms. Walley) drew attention to one of those considerations. This is a relatively minor Bill in terms of public attention. When the members of the Committee were selected, we all received communications from various bodies representing inland and coastal waterways pointing out that there had been no consultation. The Minister has since said that he is willing to consult, but if the sittings motion is passed, we shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
have dealt with all the clauses before there is time to do that. Although the Minister has said that he is willing to consult, at our third sitting he has moved a motion for the Committee to sit on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and afternoons to speed progress. That does nothing to convince those who want proper consultation that the Minister is serious about consulting them. Clearly, he has no intention of doing so. Otherwise, he would accept that there is no urgent deadline for the Committee stage. The Bill does not deal with a change in administration that must come into effect by a fixed date. It is not a school meals (increased prices) Bill that is required for the new year. It deals with a subject that we can discuss at a moderate pace. As moderate people, Opposition Members would accept that with enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could discuss the Bill at a pace that allowed the Minister to consult all the waterways bodies. I have received letters from all over the country from people who are apprehensive about the powers being given to Ministers. There was no waterway provision in the Bill when it was proposed—it is a last-minute addition. Fairness and justice must be done and Parliament must be seen as a democratic place where people can make representations. Therefore, the sittings motion is unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Don Dixon 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Jarrow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that two Opposition Members on this Committee are members of the Select Committee on European Legislation? The motion proposes that the Committee sits on Thursday afternoon, but we all know what important debate is to take place on the Floor of the House on that afternoon. Is not the sittings motion a way of keeping two prominent members of the Select Committee away from the Chamber when the debate on Maastricht is taking place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a useful point. I shall come to hon. Members' involvement in Committee work that the Bill will interrupt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The monthly magazine 
	<i>Waterways World</i> for canal and river users issued a press release. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Waterway users are incensed that the Government is attempting to force the waterway provisions of the Transport and Works Bill through parliament before the coming General Election. Many see a link between these late alterations to the Bill and the fact that the British Waterways' General Powers Bill has met overwhelming opposition in the House of Lords. British Waterways have yet to present their Private Bill for a third reading in the Lords and consequently the House of Commons, and many observers suggest that it is to be withdrawn if the Transport & Works Bill makes satisfactory progress."</p></blockquote>
That magazine caters for people who cherish and enjoy canals and rivers. It says that waterway users are incensed at the Government's attempt to force through the provisions of the Bill. What will those people think of the Minister's claim to hold consultations? He has moved a motion to rush a Bill through Parliament when there is no need to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given no explanation for the sittings motion, but he gives no lengthy explanations for anything. He moved the motion in about four sentences. He says that the Government have decided on the matter and that we should carry on. His answer to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
my amendment on the powers given to Ministers was, "Well it's all right. Ministers have done this; trust Ministers". I am not prepared to accept such a proposition. I suspect that many members of the Committee will have reservations about that doctrine, especially given recent events. However, I shall not discuss those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister claims that he is engaged in consultation. That is patently untrue. 
	<i>Waterways World</i> would have publicised any consultation or promise of it. The people affected by the Bill's provisions on waterways are not satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) mentioned Committee work. Committees sometimes change sittings motions, and awkward situations can arise. However, it was understood that the Bill was low-key—that it was not controversial and would not attract excitement. No vote took place on Second Reading because the Opposition accepted the principle of the Bill. The Committee is supposed to examine the detailed application of the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The private Bill procedure, which has lasted for more than 100 years, is the basis on which all canals and railways were constructed. The Opposition agree that that procedure is cumbersome and costly to British Rail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British Rail proposed reasonable legislation—the British Railways (No. 3) Bill, which provided for many sidings and level crossing improvements and cut-offs and junctions to improve the railway network. But the measure was costly and easily subject to delay, which was not necessarily caused by the proposed legislation. It may have occurred because another private Bill, such as the Felixstowe Docks and Railway Bill, had been rushed through the House. That happened because Conservative Members were lubricated with champagne suppers and, therefore, remained in the House to vote. That aroused resentment, which affected other legislation. The Opposition therefore supported the establishment of a different system to deal with such legislation, in the interests of developing railway networks. The Bill is not the subject of enormous controversy, yet the Committee has been presented with a motion for morning and afternoon sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Afternoon sittings will be difficult for me. I serve on the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, which meets on Tuesday afternoons. We consider many statutory instruments—I promised to give the Committee the number. That is an important task. The Minister laughs, but the scrutiny of statutory instruments does not take place because of a parliamentary quirk. Like most progressive aspects of parliamentary work, it happens because of outside pressure. Parliament is too complacent to reform itself. Ministers made several faulty statutory instruments, which led to outside pressure for improvement. Parliament then set up a Committee, which has become the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. We do a useful job. Our work is not glamorous; television cameras do not record it. We strike publicity gold rarely. I recall with pleasure an occasion when we discovered that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was not able to count sitting days during the Lancaster house talks on
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
Southern Rhodesia, which is now Zimbabwe. Consequently, the order that granted immunity to all participants, including Robert Mugabe, had expired. When that was revealed to the public prints, a number of people were anxious to make citizens arrests of some of the people involved who no longer had immunity. That stirred some interest, as can be imagined, but, like gold, such luck is rarely encountered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is widespread anxiety among the public and interested organisations about the inclusion of inland waterways, as is shown by today's packed Public Gallery and the volume of correspondence that has been received? Does my hon. Friend accept that the lack of television coverage in this Room will be made up for when the Government's failure to understand the importance of consultation is realised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. I do not seek television coverage of the Committee; that is up to the television authorities. My point is that hon. Members are mistaken if they imagine that membership of the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments or of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments—whose sittings would clash with the amended sittings for the Committee proposed in today's sittings motion—is an attempt to gain publicity. Hon. Members regularly participate in those Committees out of a sense of public interest. The public exerted the pressure for change, and it is in the public interest that the scrutiny of the Joint Select Committee—which, as the Minister will know, deals not with the merits of an instrument but with the vires of that instrument and whether it is ambiguous—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bob Dunn 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dartford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. Are we debating the sittings motion or the work of public Committees outside this Room? I am trying to understand the argument of the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer). It is one thing to say that we should not sit in the afternoon, and another to say that we should sit in the mornings only. However, the long lecture that he is giving the Committee is merely wasting time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not heard anything that is out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the hon. Member for Dartford (Mr. Dunn) was able to spring to his feet. He appeared to be reading and writing with some concentration. I thought that he was more interested in his correspondence than in our proceedings. I am gratified to learn that the hon. Gentleman is taking an interest, and I shall repeat my argument so as to spray it—metaphorically speaking—on his eyeballs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the sittings motion is passed, it may interrupt the work of an important Select Committee. That does not seem to me to be peripheral, although the hon. Member for Dartford may think that it is. He does not care about statutory instruments. He sits on the Government Benches, and is in effect saying, "Let's throw away democratic procedures and the Select Committee that is supposed to scrutinise them. Let's just hand
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
power to Ministers so that they can trample on the people." That seems to be what the hon. Gentleman is saying when he breaks off his letter writing and stutters into life with a comment that is misguided, elliptical and useless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that the hon. Member for Dartford (Mr. Dunn) used to be a Minister? Does he agree that the hon. Gentleman is probably trying to protect Ministers who want to issue statutory instruments without proper scrutiny?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend—that fact had escaped my mind. It would clearly benefit an ex-Minister hoping for preferment again before the general election if he could show that he accepts the rubric that statutory instruments should not be subject to scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was thought when we began that this Committee would proceed at a moderate pace that would allow time for important debates on the amendments: time would not be lost or wasted, but proceedings would be confined to the mornings. However, the motion has been moved after only one week of the Committee's proceedings. In view of the decisions made by the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, hon. Members will have to choose whether to attend this Committee or the Joint Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) is a member of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. It is a convention of the House that the Chairman of that Committee should be a member of the Opposition. The reason for that is an interesting reflection on the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow: it is to ensure that scrutiny is zealously carried out. If the Chairman were a member of the governing party, he might cast a blind eye on the excesses of the Government, especially as patronage carries its cankerous air through the corridors of this place. People approach others and say, "My dear boy, there is a chance for you in government." That usually melts the sternest opposition, although it is not true in every case. The hon. Member for Faversham's sturdy criticism of the Common Market for many years is probably the reason why he has not held office for that reason. It may be obvious to the Committee that the hon. Gentleman should have been a Minister; his account of his membership of the Joint Committee on Private Bill Procedure that drew up the proposals was most lucid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned our hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett). He was on his feet when the Minister intervened at our previous sitting to say that he would move the sittings motion this morning. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish is not here now because he is a member of the Select Committee on Social Services, which is conducting important interviews this morning on the Maxwell pensions fund. My hon. Friend asked me to apologise on his behalf for his absence. He will, no doubt, be present in an hour or so—when my hon. Friend has finished speaking—to continue the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that information. I assure him that my remarks, which are of the briefest character, are made merely to put on record my protests about the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) cannot grumble about having to divide his time between the Select Committee on Social Services and this Committee in the mornings—that is something that hon. Members accept. What vexes me, however, is that those who serve on Standing Committees often serve on Select Committees too. It is unfair of the Minister to abuse the Committee's goodwill by moving the sittings motion and placing people in the difficult position of having to decide which Committee to attend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only about one third of Members of Parliament serve on Select and Standing Committees. That is regrettable, but true. The Government have more power to call on people to serve on Committees because they can claim that it is their responsibility to maintain a quorum. However, only a minority of hon. Members serve on Committees. The Minister should bear that in mind. Some Conservative members of the Committee may have other commitments, but because of the grim stare from the Whip dare not raise a protest this morning, so I have to do it for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are competing demands on hon. Members' time when Standing Committees and Select Committees sit at the same time. My hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish would have no qualms about morning sittings. The matter of the Maxwell pension fund arose somewhat precipitately and the Select Committee decided to ask the Maxwells to attend to give evidence, which it has every right to do. That is an unusual and unpredictable set of circumstances. However, the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments meets every week. In 1991, the two Committees have considered 1,366 instruments. I am Chairman of those Committees and therefore have some influence on their timing. It is not possible to say, "We'll defer the Committee for a month while the Bill is being considered", because I am involved and want to be present for the afternoon sittings. If sittings of the Select Committees on Statutory Instruments were deferred, the number of statutory instruments to be considered would be so great that it would be impossible to consider them all, to receive counsel's advice and to draw conclusions. If the Committee has criticisms to make, it must obtain a memorandum from the relevant Department. We are obliged to do that; it is not merely because we want to generate extra work and to take more time. Even with the best will in the world—that is certainly present among Labour Members—we could not decide to waive the Committees. I merely chair the sittings; I cannot control their members, unlike the Government Whips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derbyshire, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is important is not merely the clash of the timings of the Committees, but the nature of that clash. My hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South is Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments and the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
and two Opposition Members of this Standing Committee are members of those Committees. The work of those Select Committees is highly relevant to our debates on the Bill: the experience of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) and of the hon. Member for Bradford, South has been most informative and useful to members of this Committee, which should continue to benefit from that experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's comments and I agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the eccentric view in the House that statutory instruments should be scrutinised. The hon. Member for Dartford does not share my views; he regards my comments on the importance of the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments as an intrusion on his writing and does not want to hear about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I served as Chairman of the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments for six years before 1983. After that, I rested for a while and resumed the chairmanship in 1987. My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East is right: my background on that Committee enables me to pick out what I regard as the excessive powers that the Government are taking in the Bill and to table amendments accordingly. To wave the Committee to one side because of the sittings motion is unacceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm, with his knowledge of statutory instruments, that if the Bill is enacted there will be an even greater need for the Select Committees on Statutory Instruments? It may be faced with a 300-page statutory instrument relating to a channel tunnel link and possibly one that seeks to authorise a canal the size of the south Yorkshire navigation, which was the subject of a Bill. There may be scores of other statutory instruments relating to the acquisition of land and the rights of anything to do with railways and waterways or something that would wipe out an Act of Parliament in any of those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman replies to that intervention, I remind him that he should reply to it in the terms of Tuesdays and Thursdays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Latham. I am grateful to you for that reminder. We could not possibly cope with all those extra instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving gently towards a curb on the number of instruments that Departments can table, so reducing the work of the Joint Select Committee. At some future date, it may be possible to accept such a sittings motion with equanimity, but we cannot do so now because primary legislation has given Ministers so many powers to move instruments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between 1987 and 1988,1,947 instruments were considered by the Joint Select Committee and the Select Committee. That gives an idea of the massive volume of work and of the time involved. Yet the Minister demands that we should spend more time on this
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
Standing Committee. Opposition Members maintain that we could consider the Bill on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, but the Minister is impatient to trample not only on the rights of Parliament but on the rights of those outside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members may have overlooked the Fertilisers Regulations 1991, which run to 69 pages. They are an example of the statutory instruments that the Joint Committee deals with as a matter of routine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I take it that these regulations are discussed on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right, Mr. Latham. My next sentence was to be that such regulations are discussed every Tuesday and Thursday by the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments or by the Select Committee. Those regulations are bulky documents and it would be unfair to propose that members of the Joint Committee should not have sufficient time to consider them. Two members of the Joint Select Committee are serving on this Standing Committee. We are protesting against the sittings motion because the Bill gives the Secretary of State a number of powers that the Joint Committee needs to consider and because Opposition Members understood that the Standing Committee would sit only in the mornings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Joint Select Committee may have between a dozen and 20 instruments to deal with on Tuesday afternoons: some may be only single sheets but others have 50,60 or 100 pages. If the sittings motion is passed and my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish and I do not attend the Joint Select Committee, the total membership of Opposition parties will be sadly affected because the minor parties have not been able to sustain their membership. The Liberal Democrats presumably find it difficult to send a Member because it has such a small membership and cannot be represented on all Committees; after the general election it will undoubtedly be smaller. I mention that simply to show how grotesquely inept the Minister's sittings motion is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, instead of talkng about Tuesdays and Thursdays it might be better to adjourn for a fortnight, or longer, while the public are consulted about the Bill. Those affected by the waterways provisions in the Bill have not been consulted. I received a letter from the Residential Boatowners Association, stating that, although a meeting with five organisations had taken place at the Department of the Environment, no meetings had taken place between organisations such as the Residential Boatowners Association and the Minister or his colleagues in the House. We should have used the time spent on debating the sittings motion to discuss whether we should adjourn to consult organisations such as the Residential Boatowners Association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be useful. I endorse my hon. Friend's suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the hon. Member for Dartford is now about to post the letter that he has been writing so assiduously. I am also pleased that the Committee is flexible enough to allow such diversions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise a personal matter about afternoon sittings. They would be inconvenient for me. "Inconvenient" is an understatement. Being a member of the Committee is important, but the Minister did not consult us before moving the sittings motion. He did not ask about other calls on Members' time. He brutally moved the motion without consultation. I am a member of the Select Committee on Members' Interests, which meets at five o'clock on Tuesday afternoons—although fortunately, it is not to sit this week. My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East is also a member of that Committee. What busy bees we are! We are members of such Committees because we believe them to be important. We believe that this Committee is important. However, we do not believe that there is enough pressure to justify the Minister's sittings motion, which is unfair. That is why I have outlined the other commitments of two Labour Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not permitted to discuss the proceedings of the Select Committee on Members' Interests in detail, but we are currently producing a report on the rules that govern Members' registration. I do not know how some Members would manage to fill in income support forms. Some find it difficult to register their business interests. The Select Committee is, therefore, trying to simplify the rules for registration. It is an important task. That is why I oppose the sittings motion. Like the Joint Select Committee on Statutory Instruments, the Select Committee on Members' Interests is charged with its tasks by the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pattern of a Standing Committee's sittings should be made clear before the membership list is drawn up. There was no indication that after a mere week the Minister intended brutally to move a sittings motion that insisted that the Committee sit in the afternoons, and which competed with other demands on hon. Members' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no secret that the Select Committee on Members' Interests is considering the register of assistants of Members of Parliament. It is of some interest that some hon. Members have provided passes for full-time employees of various public relations and commercial lobbying organisations. It is important that a responsible body in the House examines that treasure trove of public and private interests which has been lying in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that the hon. Member is straying a long way from the sittings motion. I am sure that, with his usual ingenuity, he will return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That subject is being examined on Tuesday afternoons. I do not know what sort of research assistant the Minister employs, but perhaps a sinister reason lies behind his desire for the sittings motion. Perhaps he wants to stop us examining all the interesting facets. I acquit him of that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this stage, the sittings motion is unnecessary. I would not object to a sittings motion if it were the beginning of February. We could have morning sittings in January and monitor our progress. During the first week of morning sittings, we discussed clauses 1 and 3 and my amendment, which said that the power given to Ministers to produce statutory instruments without further parliamentary procedure was not just and should be changed. No member of the Committee could claim that our arguments were lengthened unnecessarily. I spent 20 or 25 minutes—perhaps longer —explaining the amendments. No one opposed the principle of making the Minister more accountable to Parliament. No one could say that the arguments were spun out. The Minister should wait three or four more weeks before deciding on the sittings motion. We may well have discussed many more clauses by then. We might spend two half days on one subject and then rip through 10 or 15 amendments or clauses. Committees such as this work in that way. I remind the Committee that the Bill was not opposed on Second Reading, but I am beginning to think that that was a bit generous of us. The Opposition agreed with the principle of the Bill, but at the end of the first week in Committee the Minister subjects the Committee to an unwarranted, unfair, and unnecessary sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to detain the Committee, but Opposition Members do not have many weapons in their armoury. When a Minister behaves badly, our only weapon is to go into matters in great detail. If the Minister insists on treating the Committee as though it contained a group of errant schoolchildren, he will find that our desire for detailed examination will grow apace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that does not happen, and that this sittings motion does not betoken an arbitrary and arrogant attitude on the part of the Minister. I hope that the intention is not that the Committee should be subordinate to the desire to get the Bill through in a frenzied rush. I do not know why that should be desirable. The Bill is consensus legislation and is not the subject of fierce partisan argument. I was a member of the Committee considering the Broadcasting Bill. That was a controversial piece of legislation, in which concession after concession, especially in connection with the power and accountability of statutory instruments, was made. I suggest that the Minister bear that attitude in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend examine another possible reason for this premature sittings motion? It is pretty clear that the Prime Minister cannot go into the general election with his present ragbag Cabinet. Changes must be made, and promotions may be handed out. Perhaps the Minister is hoping that he will be able to boast that he got this uncontroversial Bill through committee with very little difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Perhaps the hon. Member for Bradford, South can make sure that the promotions take place on a Tuesday or a Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow makes an important and relevant point. The sittings motion is unjustifiable. Having got through the first set of amendments, we were proceeding at quite a pace. We had finished with the amendments to clause 2 and had begun to debate clause 3. My guess is that, unless the Minister insists on his absurd sittings motion, our deliberations will not take a great deal of time. I have tabled several amendments, but I shall keep my contributions as succinct as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are trying to fathom out why the Minister thinks that the sittings motion is necessary. The suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow is relevant: it may be that the Minister has been leant on. His responses have been brief and sometimes less than adequate in that he has not spelt out the detailed argument. The Minister may be desperate to allow more time for argument over the amendments, but perhaps he is being leant on by other people in the Government hierarchy. The threat of physical force and of being duffed up in the Corridor by the heavies in the Whips Office may not have been made, but the whisper of promotion may have ensnared him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are strong reasons to oppose the sittings motion, and I hope that the Minister will withdraw it. The strongest reason hinges on the individual circumstances of members of the Committee. For example, I would be seriously inconvenienced. I would have to attend the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, although by saying that I do not want to encourage the Minister to press the sittings motion with even greater enthusiasm. However, there are always ways around everything in the House of Commons, so I shall not emphasise that point. Instead, I suggest that the Minister should withdraw the sittings motion. That withdrawal should be based on the notion that Ministers' actions should be properly accountable. That is a reasonable demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to emphasise an important fact that the Minister should remember—there are people outside this House with waterways interests who are following the progress of the Bill. Those people have expressed their views in many letters and in their publication 
	<i>Waterways World.</i> They feel great resentment. 
	<i>Waterways World</i> presumably sells copies because it represents the involvement of its readers in waterways. It is based on the marketplace and the Minister should take notice of it. Even if he is not interested in democratic accountability, he may be interested in the marketplace. If a magazine sells enough copies it surely must reflect the views and aspirations of its readers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<i>Waterways World</i> uses the word "insensed" in referring to the Minister's arbitrary attitude—an attitude that has been demonstrated again today. The interests of waterway users are paramount. If the Committee continued to sit on Tuesday and Thursday mornings only, there would be adequate time to consult waterway interests and for the Minister to give the required assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have to table amendments on Report, but consideration on Report is limited to one
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
day, unless the Minister is thinking of making it two or three days if we agree to afternoon sittings. That would enable us to consider afternoon sittings with a fresh approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my concern that the rules issued by the Minister's Department yesterday need extensive consultation? If the Minister rushes ahead with afternoon sittings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it will be impossible for waterways associations to have proper consultation on the rules. The Minister has already made one mistake, and he intends to compound it with another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share my hon. Friend's concern. I genuinely cannot understand the Minister's rush towards afternoon sittings. There is no pressing reason to justify them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North said that the Department has issued new rules. They must be subject to consultation. After the Minister has consulted waterways' interests he may wish to table amendments. If we sit on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, we shall complete consideration in Committee before the Minister has time to act. That means that any Government amendments will have to be tabled on Report, which may last only a day or two.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attention has been diverted by the Government Whip who seems to be using the Committee as a baseball field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Nothing has been out of order so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Latham, for that hinted injunction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfair of the Minister to rush consideration in Committee when he may wish to table amendments. Those amendments may have to be tabled in the Lords, and that would be deplorable. We should not have to rely on the other place to do a job that we should do here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My remarks have taken more time than I expected. That is due to the interest shown by my hon. Friends and by the hon. Member for Dartford, who intervened, rather crossly, in my remarks. I had to explain my fears to him in detail because he seemed unable to grasp the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I oppose the sittings motion and warn the Minister that, because we are extremely dissatisfied, we shall probably press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Moate 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Faversham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is hard of the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) to suggest that my hon. Friend the Minister has been totalitarian, arbitrary and arrogant—I use just a few of the adjectives used by the hon. Gentleman—and that he has treated members of the Committee like schoolchildren. My hon. Friend is one of the most accommodating of Ministers. He has been most responsive to the Committee so far, conceded the principle of several Opposition amendments and, in certain cases, the amendments themselves. He is anxious to engage in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
extensive consultations at all times. Indeed, the Bill is based on many years of consultation. If it has gone slightly wrong on this occasion, we should not doubt the general desire to correct that at the earliest opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong of the hon. Member for Bradford, South to dismiss the opportunities that exist in another place to table amendments after consultations have taken place. Those consultations often arise as the result of proceedings in the House of Commons. It is of immense importance that amendments can be tabled on Report, in another place and, if necessary, when the Bill returns to the House of Commons. That is part of the parliamentary consultative procedure. It is not right to suggest that because we complete a stage in the consideration of a Bill in the House of Commons, there will be no opportunities thereafter for outside interests to make representations and for changes to be made. Many subsequent changes are made to Bills and there will be plenty of further opportunities in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motion is modest. It merely proposes that we should sit in the afternoons. I am sure that the constituents of the hon. Member for Bradford, South would not think that an unreasonable effort for the Committee; it is hardly excessive. I presume that afternoon sittings could extend throughout the night, if necessary. Presumably, that would not inconvenience the hon. Gentleman. I remember that some sittings of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments seemed to go on all night because they were fairly heavy weather. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman could return to the Committee during the night if that were suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motion is modest because if agreed it would not truncate debate. It is hardly forcing through legislation to sit in the afternoons in Committee. It means that we shall have more time to scrutinise the Bill. The hon. Member for Bradford, South regards the Bill as important; it is therefore reasonable to allow more time for its scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bradford, South said that we all know how a Committee works. We know, for example, that sometimes a lot of time is taken over one clause and then the Committee works apace through a batch of clauses and amendments. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman took almost an hour on a simple proposition. That does not give me great grounds for optimism that in future we shall whistle through batches of clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is our third sitting but we have only just reached clause 3. It might be said that we have been considering important clauses, but there are plenty more that are important. If we carry on at this pace, we shall need 187 hours in Committee, which might take us to next autumn without allowing for a summer recess. It is not that sort of Bill but we are taking a lot of time with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not complain about the time that we take to debate the Bill because it is an important measure. I was surprised that we were offered only morning sittings at the outset. We should take it steadily and rapidly, not with a sense of desperation but just to get it moving. That has less to do with a general election—there are few votes in the Bill—than with outside interests. It is important that we make rapid progress
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
so that the Bill is on the statute book as soon as possible and voluntary and professional organisations, parliamentary agents, promoters and so on know exactly how to plan forthcoming works projects. There has been much uncertainty for a long time and we should therefore make sensible progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us wants to sit in the afternoons, but it is perfectly sensible to do so. I imagine that we could have been bullied into sitting this afternoon, but it is hardly unreasonable to ask us to do so on Thursday afternoon. We shall resume in January and make steady progress on the Bill. It is a perfectly sensible package, and I hope that we can make progress, for the sake of other interests and the proper scrutiny of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My opinion of the sittings motion could, however, be altered. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can reassure me that the extra time will be used to ensure that, barring accidents, the new procedure is in place by the autumn. I do not have the notes on clause 6 that my hon. Friend the Minister has issued, but I understand that they set out some of the procedures to be applied in the order-making process. I was worried that the Bill would be approved but that delays in those procedures would mean that, come the autumn, the legislation would not be fully operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can assure me that the results of our extra labours stemming from the sittings motion will help to ensure that the new system is in operation by 27 November, when, according to the present rules, Bills have to be deposited. If the new system is not in force by then, much time will have been wasted. That would be a very series problem. It would cause much uncertainty if, by 27 November, outside interests did not know whether they should table private Bills. In fact, they would have little choice but to do so. That would lead to another year of uncertainty, with private Bills going before the House at great expense and with the probability of new legislation intervening at some time during the year. That would be entirely unsatisfactory. I am sure that nobody wants that to happen. Equally, I am sure that the relevant Departments are under great pressure to finalise the arrangements. Such matters have to take their place in the queue, but a Minister can resolve the difficulty by making extra resources available or by giving the arrangements a higher priority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will assure the Committee that there will be a general determination, if the Bill proceeds as I believe that it should, to have the legislation fully operative for the autumn, thus replacing the private Bill procedure as it affects works projects with the new system. I think that we are entitled to clarity about the hours that we should sit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) said that there was nothing wrong in having afternoon sittings from next Thursday. Thursday afternoon has a considerable importance for hon. Members, however, as the Maastricht treaty is the subject for debate on the Floor of the House of Commons. That debate is relevant to this Committee in that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
the amendments to article 75 of the treaty, dealing with transport and safety provisions, are related to our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, Committee members have an extra interest in what is going on on the Floor of the House. For example, my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) is Chairman of the Select Committee on European Legislation. He has already suggested that that Committee should consider the Maastricht treaty, before the matter is discussed on the Floor of the House. That Select Committee is charged with scrutinising European directives, regulations and measures. Indeed, it is often known simply as the Scrutiny Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that many people will wish to speak during the debate? Mr. Speaker always gives preference to hon. Members who sit through the opening speeches from both Front Benches, no matter how long and turgid they may be. The sittings motion cuts out not only those who have a specialist interest in the debate, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South, but any member of the Committee who wishes to participate. There will be a queue of speakers, and we shall not be able to convince Mr. Speaker that we are serious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee who, like me, are ordinary Back Bench Members, will encounter great problems if they wish to speak in the debate on Maastricht. We do not hold any positions that give us priority. There is an order of priority that extends from the Front Benches to various senior Members, to people who hold chairmanships. I put my name down to speak in the House for the two-day Maastricht debate. I stayed in the House for two days. I had tabled an amendment that was not selected on a previous occasion. My amendment was still not called. I shall attempt to speak in the debate on Wednesday or Thursday, and I may have to stay in the House all day on Wednesday in order to speak on Thursday. I shall have to be present during the opening speeches. If the sittings motion is accepted, the Committee will sit at 4.30 pm. But Maastricht debate may not begin until 4.30 pm. Even if the debate begins at 3.30 pm, there will be no opportunity for Back Benchers like me to speak if the Committee sits at 4.30 pm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to be called to speak in the debate and to participate generally by listening to other Members' contributions. Even if there is a valid argument for afternoon sittings, it should not apply this week, because special circumstances exist on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the final week before the Christmas recess. The Committee cannot meet during the recess, and most hon. Members will attempt to clear the decks before the recess to enable them to concentrate on constituency business and have a short break. Hon. Members are attempting to tackle a heavy work load. Committee work is beginning to gather momentum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three members of the Committee are also members of the Select Committee on European Legislation. The hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Knowles) is much involved in its activities, and he will be interested in the debate on Maastricht. I tabled an amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
during the earlier debate on Maastricht and today I tabled an amendment to an early-day motion on subsidiarity. I am keen to attempt to table amendments during the debate on Wednesday and Thursday. It is my right, and in the interest of my constituents, to be able to participate in the debate. Yet important business might take place in Committee during that time. I should like to participate in that, too. I cannot even show half an interest in the Committee's proceedings by being in the Committee corridor and waiting for a Division to be called. If I am in the Chamber, I will not know when a Division is called and so will not be able to vote in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should think again. If my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South can be said to be succinct, the Minister can be said to be extinct. His introductory remarks were very brief, but I hope that he has taken account of what Opposition Members have said in their detailed speeches on the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been present during numerous debates on sittings motions. Often Opposition Members do not agree with them, but in the debate on this sittings motion several serious points have been made and the Minister should reply to them. If afternoon sittings were postponed until after the recess, that would benefit the work of the Committee as it would allow consultations to take place and help those members of the Committee who are engaged in other activities. If the Committee sits in the afternoons, I shall fall foul in several respects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already mentioned that I am a member of the Select Comittee on European Legislation. I also serve on European Standing Committee A. Although both Committees meet in the morning, I can move between the two. I was aware of that when I agreed to serve on this Committee, but I did not realise that there would be this doubling up at such an early stage. Furthermore, I am also a member of the Select Committee on Members' Interests. That Committee is currently involved in careful, private deliberations that require a great deal of preparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a member of three other Committees as well as serving on this Committee. In addition to that, I want to be involved in the important work that is taking place on the Floor of the House, including the Report stage of the Local Government Finance Bill and discussions on the Maastricht negotiations. I am being asked to do too much and my constituency work will suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's constituency borders on my own. He should be grateful to me for being so active in canvassing in Derbyshire, West on behalf of the Labour candidate. I was told after the famous by-election that returned the Minister to the House that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That canvassing did not take place on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The hon. Gentleman should return to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might have been as a result of the Labour party's work that the alliance—as it was then called—was scuppered. That might have benefited the Minister.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
I hope that the Minister will show my serious arguments some sympathy and consider them on their merits. The sittings motion should be withdrawn and tabled later. That would allow consultation to take place and hon. Members would be able to meet their responsibilities to Committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what has been said and the strictures of my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South, I declare not that I have a commercial interest, but that I am a member of the Inland Waterways Association and have navigated inland waterways for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) says that we have spent a long time on the Bill, but given the importance of the clauses that we have discussed, I think that the opposite is true. I have been on Standing Committees that have taken two mornings to consider the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee progressed very well, so I am sorry that the Minister tabled the sittings motion. I shall divide my remarks into two parts. I object to the motion in principle, although I shall conclude with what I hope will be a constructive suggestion. We have spoken about reputations and possible promotions. I am sorry for the Minister because the sittings motion will be newsworthy. Until now our proceedings have not hit the headlines, but the sittings motion debate may prove helpful to Opposition Members as it has converted a relatively uncontroversial Bill into a more controversial one. It has been tabled because my hon. Friends have raised matters about consultations on inland waterways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accepted convention of the House is that Standing Committees sit on Tuesday and Thursday mornings between 10.30 am and 1 pm. We put that in our diaries—that time is allocated. If half way or two thirds of the way through the Bill, the pace needs to be quickened, in my experience informal conversations take place and some agreement is reached to mutual advantage. No one wants to spend more time than is necessary on a Bill. I am not aware that any informal conversations have taken place on this Committee. At the close of the debate last Thursday, the Minister briefly said something about a sittings motion. I thought that he was going to say that we would be let off early on Thursday because of Christmas, not that he would suggest afternoon sittings. However, it appears that he already had that in mind after the second sitting on the Bill. That reveals an unfortunate turn of mind because we were making quite good progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is advantageous to Parliament to have two mornings set aside for Standing Committees. My hon. Friends have pointed out that other things take place at the times that the Minister now wants us to sit. From 3.30 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays, debates take place on the Floor of the House. We do not know what the subject of the debates will be after Christmas, but we know the important subject to be debated this Thursday, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sittings motion would disrupt attendance at other Committees, where hon. Members have duties.
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
The Minister is creating a conflict of interest that should not arise. If hon. Members are asked unexpectedly to be in two places at once, the Minister and the Government are interfering with the discharge of duties and with the smooth running of Parliament. I do not know how many Conservative Members have been on Committees that have sat in the evenings, but as the hon. Member for Faversham noted, more is involved than afternoon sittings. The sitting could last through the afternoon, the evening and, conceivably, all night. I warn Conservative Members that when that happens one's life changes—family life, parliamentary life, constituency life—almost out of recognition. Hon. Members who have not experienced that should question their colleagues who have. Of course, the lives of the Chairmen and the officials also change. Such disruption is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another matter that may have escaped the Minister's notice. The Committee's proceedings are something of a voyage of discovery, as they should be. The Government or an outside body may promote a Bill, or—as in this case—it could be recommended by a Select Committee. But detailed examination of a law often reveals difficulties or problems that the promoters—especially those who are not so good at consultation—have not perceived. That is true of some aspects of this Bill, and they will need plenty of timed and sequential consultation. One of the advantages of sitting only on Tuesday and Thursday mornings is that there is plenty of time on, say, Tuesday afternoon or evening and during the intervening day to find out what has gone wrong, to get the papers and to make telephone calls. If necessary, it is even possible to talk to the Minister. That allows difficulties to be cleared up so that proceedings on the Thursday can continue much faster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the sittings motion is passed, it will change the Committee's atmosphere. Matters will have to be dealt with in detail on Tuesdays and Thursdays which might have been settled elsewhere. The ingenuity and welcome humour of my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) have shown how my hon. Friends will be able to use the opportunity to extend proceedings on Tuesdays and Thursdays, perhaps late into the night. They have plenty of expertise in doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a paradox in the disruption of hon. Members' time? The Bill will improve the working of House by removing a lot of private Bill work, which has been a heavy burden for hon. Members. For the convenience of the Queen's counsel, private Bill debates start early in the afternoon. That has meant that hon. Members have missed on time and other procedures on the Floor of the House which a later start would have allowed them to catch. We are discussing a Bill that will clear up those problems. It should employ techniques that are compatible with the principles that we are trying to pursue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has emphasised the orderliness of parliamentary proceedings. The Minister should think twice about sitting on Tuesday and Thursday evenings because we would not have been in this position if he had not included
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
clause 3, which deals with waterways. The unexpected inclusion of those provisions has caused the ruffling of waters which otherwise would have been smooth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reluctant to intervene but I draw hon. Members' attention to the press notice issued by the then Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons, the right hon. and learned Member for Surrey, East (Sir G. Howe), and by the then Secretary of State for the Environment on 21 June 1990. That notice made the scope of the new order-making procedure clear. I do not wish to read the whole paragraph, as the document is public and open to any inspection. It proposed a new
	<br><blockquote><p>"procedure for railway and light rapid transit schemes in such a way that it can be extended by subordinate legislation for use to authorise other work projects currently approved by private Act. In most years there are a small number of such works bills for such schemes as tidal barrages and canal works."</p></blockquote>
Instead of achieving that aim by subordinate legislation, we have included the provision in the Bill. It was mentioned in the press release of 17 May this year, so it is not true to say that the provision has been included at a late stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) replies to the Minister—and it is proper for him to do that—I hope that he will do so in the terms of the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. The Minister referred to a document that he is holding, but it has not been laid on the Table. There is a convention in the House that, I believe, is included in the Standing Orders—it is that when a Minister refers to a document in the Chamber, he must lay it on the Table and make it available to hon. Members. Does that apply to Standing Committees? The document might be useful to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Latham. There is no secrecy about the document. It is a press notice which, I believe, is available in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Latham. I did not imply that the document was secret. If the convention of Ministers making documents available applies to Standing Committees as well as to the Chamber, it might help our proceedings. That would be preferable to hon. Members haring down to the Library to search for the document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As I understand the Standing Order, under a ruling that Mr. Speaker made on 21 February 1966 it is the responsibility of the Department that promotes the Bill to supply to the Library in advance of the Committee stage a list of all papers—for example, statutes and regulations—that appear to be relevant to the debate on the Bill. After consulting the list, members of the Committee can order the papers that they require from the Vote Office. As far as I am aware—and I stand to be corrected—it is not obligatory for documents that the Minister reads out to be on the Table. If the Minister wishes to make the document available, it is a matter for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Latham. I shall relate my response to the Minister to your remarks. I emphasised the appropriateness of sitting only on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. Without the proposed evening sittings, opportunities would exist for conversations, clarification, consultations and meetings on matters that had unexpectedly come to the attention of the Committee. The Minister claimed in his intervention that the unexpected item that I mentioned —the inclusion in the Bill of waterways, their construction and their use—was not unexpected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue that remark; it would not be proper during a debate on a sittings motion. However, I shall comment on it when we resume our discussions on clause 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my hon. Friends will wish to challenge the Minister's claim that the provision was not unexpectedly included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to put the facts straight. I went to the Library and obtained a copy of the May 1991 press notice. It stated clearly that the Bill would include inland waterways schemes. The hon. Gentleman is right; there is dispute about the word "unexpectedly". Whether the issue was handled correctly is a different matter, but the provision was published in a Department of Transport press notice of 17 May 1991.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information. I re-emphasise that that matter can be discussed in the proper debates in Committee in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his advocacy of the Committee sitting on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, the Minister may not have been aware that a similar situation arose during the proceedings of the Water Bill in 1972. Inland waterways were an unexpected inclusion in the Bill that created regional water authorities. On that occasion, not only did the Minister get into awful trouble with both his constituents and with those of his hon. Friends because of the lobby that suddenly erupted, but he had to be helped by another Minister. The Chairman was so exasperated with the Committee that it had to be adjourned for a fortnight to get itself straight. In not allowing proper time between Tuesdays and Thursdays for sorting our the effective and important inland waterways lobby, the Minister is playing with fire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South said, we have a copy of 
	<i>"Waterways World".</i> In January 1992 in 
	<i>"Waterways World"</i> there will be a legal opinion on this Bill, and which will go into matters that we have already discussed and the powers labelled (a) to (i)—I shall not read them out. Thousands of people will be alerted, for the first time, to what is happening in the Committee. If we accept the sittings motion, we shall have passed clause 3 by the time that people read the "Waterways World" document in January 1992 and before telephone messages are sent to the many branches of the Inland Waterways Association. The Minister and his hon. Friends will be bombarded with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
letters. When people discover that the relevant clause in the Bill has gone by, perhaps because of an evening sitting on Thursday, there will be increased indignation, which could mean trouble for the Minister and the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East raised an important issue, which followed from the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South about waterways, in which he has a special interest. As Chairman of the Select Committee on European Legislation, will my hon. Friend elaborate on his position in relation to Thursday's debate on the treaty of Maastricht? If this Committee sits on Thursday afternoon, its members will be debarred from being present, let alone from speaking in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I was about to change gear and point out to the Minister, his hon. Friends and the business managers some of the perils that lie in the shallow canals ahead, and which have not been surveyed. I hope that my remarks have shown that they may be heading for trouble. They could reduce the problems by ensuring that the debate continues in January and is not concluded before Christmas. If it is, people's indignation and the amount of steam in their boilers will be much greater. They may be more indignant because it will be too late to ventilate their opinions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall revert to the constructive suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South. I said that the orderly arrangements of the House mean that normal conditions, which I hope will prevail throughout the passage of the Bill, will be disrupted at relatively short notice after the business of the House for next Thursday has been announced. That shows the insensitivity of the Government's business managers. We are asked to be in two places at once this Thursday when the business in the House is important not only to the three members of the Select Committee on European Legislation, but to us all. I shall not discuss the likelihood of legislative powers being taken by a body outside the House, but that is what is involved in the treaty of Maastricht. There may be cross-party views about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that while the House discusses Europe and the Maastricht treaty on Thursday, it is unfortunate that we must be in Committee to debate what could be the destruction of inland waterways? In other parts of Europe inland waterways have been improved, but this Bill could lead to the destruction of our inland waterways. That is the fear of ordinary people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing out what could be a certain irony. As a footnote, I should tell the Committee that I navigated some inland waterways in France during the summer. I appreciate the rather better standards in France, although it has every right to do what it wants—as does Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should think again about sitting this Thursday, although there is no doubt that he will get
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
what he wishes. I do not know the correct procedure, but at a convenient moment I should like to move a manuscript amendment—of which you have had notice, Mr. Latham—to
	<br><blockquote><p>leave out from "Thursday" and insert "Tuesday 14 January".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister might save some trouble and say that such an amendment has a certain appeal. I do not want my amendment to detract from my opposition in principle to another sittings motion at this stage. It is inappropriate but my manuscript amendment would make it less so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend saying that his manuscript amendment would offer the Minister a compromise and allow people to participate in the important debate in the House on Thursday? If so, my hon. Friend's offer is generous and is a sign of the Opposition's willingness and tolerance. The amendment would have my strong support in view of the very important debate on Thursday. I would be grateful if my hon. Friend would elaborate on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an individual initiative, for reasons that my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South will recognise. It is open to us to speak on the sittings motion for some time—barring a closure motion from the Government—but when the question is put, the make-up of the Committee presupposes the conclusion. I hope that the Minister will agree to my manuscript amendment. I wish to make it quite clear that I oppose the concept of the sittings motion, but my manuscript amendment would add to the lubrication of future sittings of the Committee for very good procedural reasons. I am sure that Conservative Members have matters to which they wish to attend on Thursday—[Hon. Members: "No."]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am concerned, as my hon. Friend will be, about the grunts from Conservative Members opposing attendance at the debate on Maastricht. My hon. Friend's amendment has much to commend it. Will he remind the Committee of the important issues at stake? We should have the right to be present in the Chamber, if we so choose. Thursday will be the second day of only a two-day debate on this important issue. There will be a Division at 10 o'clock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Newham, South responds, I remind him that he should do so in the terms of the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, I shall do that Mr. Latham. If the sittings motion is passed, it will mean that we cannot be in the Chamber. I have tabled several amendments to clause 3 and to the schedule. If we sit on Thursday, I must be here to move them, or at least to speak to them. At the same time, a debate will take place on the Floor of the House which has mountainous constitutional significance for this country. The matter is by no means cut and dried. It does not depend on party issues; hon. Members on both sides of the House have various views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate in the House is important not only because of its constitutional significance—the powers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
of this House, of hon. Members and of the public—but because the very independence and self-government of the United Kingdom is at stake. The debate will not be on party lines and speeches cannot be predicted with any certainty. That makes it an important debate. For the Minister to create a conflict of interest for hon. Members who have a concern in such matters illustrates an attitude that I am sure the Minister does not really hold, but if matters stay as they are, he could be criticised on that ground alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister agrees with my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South that withdrawing the sittings motion would be common sense and good procedure.

	<i>Manuscript amendment proposed:</i> to leave out from "Thursday" and insert "Tuesday 14 January at half-past four o'clock."—[
	<i>Mr. Spearing.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It might help the Committee if I outlined the procedure regarding the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Newham, South. It is entirely within the discretion of the Chair whether to accept manuscript amendments. Usually, I would not be prepared to do so, but as the Government's sittings motion was not included in the amendment paper, but read out by the Minister at the beginning of the sitting, hon. Members have not had a chance to see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, I decided to accept the manuscript amendment, which can be voted upon before the Committee votes on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We started this debate at the beginning of our sitting this morning. I am amazed at the surprise expressed by Opposition Members because I gave notice on Thursday of my intention to move a new sittings motion. I understand that it was not necessary to give that notice, but I did so in order that the Committee would be aware of what I intended to do and would not be surprised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had some interesting and long speeches. Some contributions from the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) made me feel that I should move a sittings motion at the beginning of every sitting. His speech was enlightening and certainly entertaining. He implied that I was rushing the Bill because there might be a general election early in the new year. The hon. Gentleman is right—there will be a general election on or before 7 July, so this Parliament will not run for a full parliamentary year. However, I believe that the parties agree about the desirability of the legislation. I am not trying to rush the Bill through. However, it is obvious that there is more to debate in Committee and I wish to give the hon. Gentleman—and all members of the Committee—every opportunity to make points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) asked whether, if the Bill was passed, we could avoid having to deposit private Bills next
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
November. The hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) is not here—I understand the reasons for his absence—but he, too, was keen that no private Bills be deposited next November. That depends on obtaining agreement not only on the rules that I circulated yesterday, but on the model clauses and rules on tribunals. We hope that, if the Bill is passed, it will be up and running in time to ensure that no private Bills are deposited next November. However, I cannot give an assurance on that; it depends on how much progress has been made. As my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham pointed out, if we continue at our present rate of progress, we might still be debating the Bill next autumn, were it not for the general election. The Bill would fall at a general election.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the point that is made by the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) based on progress made on the first three clauses? When we debated the Employment Act 1982, we spent 102 hours on clauses 1 and 2. The time spent on the first clauses does not necessarily mean that we shall spend the same amount of time on other clauses. Some clauses are more important than others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. However, the legislation that he mentioned was probably opposed by the Opposition on Second Reading. It was far more controversial that the Bill. There is, therefore, a difference between that legislation and the Bill. I believe that the Employment Act 1982 was guillotined when in Committee to help progress. If the Government had not used their guillotine powers, perhaps progress on the Bill would not have continued at the same pace as on the first two clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not complain about the time that we have spent debating the Bill. I do not accuse the Opposition, or any participants in our debate, of trying to slow our progress. I seek more time for debating the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A manuscript amendment was moved by the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing). We have spent two hours discussing the sittings motion. I am, therefore, reluctant to waste the opportunity presented by Thursday afternoon to make some of the progress that we should have made this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A sittings motion that allows a Committee to sit in the afternoon does not necessarily mean that it will sit in the afternoon. That depends on the progress that has been made. If we make good progress, we may not have to sit in the afternoons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Barnes) and for Bradford, South told the Committee about the Committees of which they were members. They seem to carry the whole weight of representation of the parliamentary Labour party on their shoulders. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
am reminded of a television interview with a leading member of the Conservative party, Lord Prior, when he was Secretary of State for Employment. He was asked about comments made by the former Prime Minister which impinged on his treatment of various issues. He replied: "Never feel sorry for politicians. They don't have to be there and they don't have to do it." That is my answer to hon. Members who complain about which Committees they should serve on. I cannot be responsible for that. I am responsible for ensuring that this Bill, which has general support, makes some progress. This morning could have been spent on a useful debate about issues relating to the waterways proposals. We shall now have to start that debate on Thursday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I revert to a point that my hon. Friend the Minister made in response to a question that I asked about the timing of the introduction of the orders? Will he confirm that the Government's intention is that the new procedure should be in force by next November? It would be helpful to know the Government's firm intention on that matter. Although my hon. Friend said that that deadline could not be guaranteed, will he assure the Committee that the necessary resources and expert staff will be made available so that, as far as is within his power, all efforts are made to introduce the new procedure by 27 November?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies, I must tell him what I have told other hon. Members: he must respond within the terms of the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee were meeting in the morning and in the afternoon on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the progress that would be made would help to complete the Bill's parliamentary stages in time to meet the deadline. That will ensure that private Bills are no longer necessary and no longer take up hon. Members' time. Therefore, it is in the Committee's interests to sit on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Walley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is so different about the Bill that makes this sittings motion so important? I served with the Minister on the Committee stage of the Ports Bill, when much progress was made because of the good understanding on both sides. However, the Minister is not taking Opposition Members' points into account, nor is he acknowledging the widespread anxiety about the way in which he is forcing the Bill through at an unacceptable pace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will be able to vote according to her convictions. It is right and necessary to move a fresh sittings motion now, as I have explained. I commend the motion to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is well known that when sittings motions are moved, whether at the beginning of proceedings or half or two thirds of the way through them, there is what may be called a traditional debate. Traditional speeches are made, some of which include a degree of humour, and I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, South on his contribution this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
However, this sittings motion is not normal. By declining any constructive proposal from the Opposition, the Minister has managed to inject a degree of anger into some Labour Members who, for many years, have been vigilant against oppression and authoritarianism. Conservative Members who are vigilant against similar trends across the channel share that frame of mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for the anger in my tone, but I cannot help it. Will the Minister give the Committee a hint of what he might do at about four o'clock on Thursday? Will he table a motion on Thursday at 1 o'clock or just before, as is in his power, to detail what the Committee will do for the rest of the day? He hinted that that might be possible. If we have to be here on Thursday evening for some time, other considerations will come into play. The matter may become even more newsworthy and it will not be to the Government's benefit. I am disappointed and angry by what the Minister has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the sittings motion but last Tuesday it went through virtually on the nod. Had we wanted to be awkward, we could have procrastinated and spent all Tuesday morning debating it. But we did not because we are keen to examine the Bill constructively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South and I could remain in Committee on Thursday afternoon and allow our hon. Friends to participate in the debate on the Floor of the House. The Government will have to maintain a quorum irrespective of what time the Committee finishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Spearing</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either the Minister was under some instruction not to provide even the little easement that I requested in my manuscript amendment, which reflects the rigidity and unwisdom of various business managers who are not in the Room, or he was given the flexibility and has declined to exercise it. In either case, it reflects more on the Government than on the procedures of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to speak again, but the Minister's cavalier attitude stimulates me to do so. I speak about the manuscript amendment which you, Mr. Latham, have been kind enough to let the Committee consider. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South has suggested a compromise but, to be frank, the Minister is not responding adequately to the Committee. It is not a question of just rubber stamping matters: the Minister should listen to the debate, pick out points and respond to them. But so inadequate was his response that the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) had to ask him twice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and the work of the Select Committee on Members' Interests on hon. Members' passes. The hon. Gentleman was not in the Room when I touched on the subject earlier. I wish that he had been, because I could have gone into the matter in some detail. But I shall not go down that road, Mr. Latham, tempting though it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in events that took place a year and a half ago involving a certain pass. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because he gave me a huge amount of national publicity. He will be a friend for life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South has proposed that the Committee should agree to Tuesday and Thursday afternoon sittings commencing in the new year when Parliament resumes. I have explained why I am not keen on afternoon sittings, but I am grateful to my hon. Friend for suggesting a useful compromise. Had the Minister any glimmer of understanding of parliamentary procedure, he would know that moving a sittings motion when the Committee has sat for only a week and when he sits in sole judgment on our progress—he is not making much of a fist of it either—would provoke lengthy and detailed discussion. The Minister should not express alarm and concern about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are saying, "We do not like Tuesday and Thursday afternoon sittings but we will agree to them after the recess, provided that the Committee does not sit this coming Thursday." That is entirely reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all realise the importance of the Maastricht treaty, just as we know the importance of the Single European Act and the continuing flow of concessions that have been made to the European Economic Community. No one knows the details of the Maastricht treaty. We received the consolidated treaty only yesterday, so it is not unreasonable to ask that hon. Members should be able to attend the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that a Minister will open the debate. Questions will be put on Wednesday—almost certainly through interventions—to elucidate points about this highly complicated treaty, which was negotiated over several days in Holland. Tomorrow, a Minister—probably the Prime Minister—will elaborate on the debate and interventions will be made. On Thursday, further information will be given in the opening speech from a Minister. That will start about 4.30 pm—the very time that the Committee is to sit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a way, my hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, North-East anticipated the manuscript amendment that was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South. He said that he tried to speak in the debate before the Maastricht negotiations but was not successful. My hon. Friend intends to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
present at the debate on Wednesday and Thursday and will not be in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the development of a federal, western European united states, yet the Minister blithely utters contemptuous platitudes about the Committee having to make progress and sit on Thursday. He is saying that Opposition Members have been naughty in spending more than two hours discussing a sittings motion. That motion aroused our ire because it was tabled after only one week. The Minister intends to keep us out of the debate on Maastricht, even though it will be on the creeping power of federalism undermining the United Kingdom Parliament. That process has been going on for year after year yet Conservative Members—not all—blithely allow it to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At last the hon. Gentleman has made an effective point. Perhaps we should be in the chamber on Thursday afternoon to ensure that we can support the hon. Gentleman's case. Clearly his complaint is not against the Conservative party but against the Labour Front Bench. That is the biggest threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The manuscript amendment would have received more support from Conservative Members if two hours had not been wasted, which has prevented us from making progress on this important Bill. Had the hon. Gentleman expressed that argument earlier more rationally and quickly, we might have supported him, but when Opposition Members spend two hours on a relatively minor point—a form of parliamentary bullying—how does he expect Conservative Members to respond?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Gentleman responds, I remind hon. Members of what I said in the first sitting about the length of interventions in other hon. Members' speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Latham, for your pointing out that the hon. Member for Faversham (Mr. Moate) has intervened at length in my speech in order to delay it. I was about to conclude before the hon. Gentleman intervened. The hon. Member for Faversham and my hon. Friends and I linked out comments with the Minister's proposal instantaneously—everything was in order. It irks me that a valid debate on the sittings motion is taking place after only one week of consideration of the Bill. That is not justified. Hon. Members may comment on the inconvenience suffered by members of this and other Committees, but many people outside the House who are involved with inland waterways object to the Government's cavalier attitude. The Minister produced a document and said, "Ah well, a long time ago the then Minister happened to mention it in a press release." The Minister has not placed that document in the Library, as he should have done. The only documents that were presented to the Library were the notes on clauses. I understand that a research worker may have the Minister's document, but that research worker is not in the building. It is not good enough for the Minister to refer to a document and then blandly to assume that it is available to the Committee. I welcome the face that he refers to it, but it is an argument for spending more time outside Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moate</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Latham. The hon. Member for Bradford, South is accusing me of misleading the Committee. I went to the Library and obtained the document. It was not dug out by a research worker; it was readily available, as are all Department of Transport press notices, in the box labelled "notices". I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is not completely clear about the available information and about the procedures of the House. The document was a press statement, available at the time that the Bill was produced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well be—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Faversham raised a point of order on which I must rule, although he has not said anything that requires a ruling. He gave information as a matter of fact and we should return to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked the Library for the documents during a sitting of the Committee. I was told, perhaps mistakenly, that we had already been provided with the only documentation available. I shall pursue the issue again. It shows that more time, not less, is needed outside the Committee and how important it is to consider the motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South said, in effect, that we could shrug off the inconveniences faced by members of the Committee and accept that the difficulties of people with waterways interests will be the subject of the Minister's consultation—there is not much time for that—provided that we did not sit this Thursday. He tabled a manuscript amendment to that effect. That is entirely reasonable and the Minister should accept it, but he is being unnecessarily obdurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dixon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that this Thursday is probably the last day this year on which the Government will have the opportunity to make a statement? They are in a mess because of repossessions on mortgages; they will probably make a statement when they have an agreement—or have tried to reach an agreement—with the various organisations involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thursday is the last business questions this year and members of this Committee will be robbed of the opportunity to question the Leader of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. That is another reason why the manuscript amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South should be accepted. It is entirely in line with Government thinking that opportunities for Back Benchers should be resisted and removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proposed that questions on the business statement should be cut to half an hour, that ten-minute Bills shold be virtually eradicated and that the Christmas Adjournment debate, which has already been curtailed, should be further curtailed. That is entirely in line with the Government's general attitude. My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow is right: Thursday is an important day, apart from the debate on Maastricht, which he cited as a reason why the Committee should
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
not sit. Business questions are an important opportunity for issues to be raised, but members of this Committee will be denied that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Maastricht treaty will be explained to the House on Thursday. That is of enormous importance. The hon. Member for Faversham suggested that there was unanimity on the Conservative Benches and a difference of opinion among the Opposition. He knows that that is not true. I am delighted to say that there are differing views about the Common Market on both sides of the party divide. I have never held the view that political parties should be composed of blocks of minds instructed to vote and to think in a particular way. I shall return to the issue of Thursday in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good to have debate and for points of view to be exchanged within and between parties. That is part of the democratic process, and long may it prevail. We cannot take part in that process on Thursday because it is denied us by ministerial fiat, supported by Back Benchers who are in the position that I described: the Whip tells them what to do and they vote accordingly. Conservative members of the Committee will vote to cut themselves out of the vote on Maastricht and deny themselves the opportunity to listen to and participate in the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Carttiss 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Yarmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not terribly keen on Maastricht. I have much sympathy with the views of the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer) on those issues and I wondered whether we should make an exception for Thursday afternoon sittings. However, the Committee has been wearied for so long and the argument has become outworn. I am therefore convinced that we must meet on Thursday afternoon. The hon. Gentleman had a good case, which he should have made much more succinctly. He ruined his case with the verbosity for which he is so well known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cryer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an ingenious way of submitting to the Whips and trying to obtain a shred of dignity to suggest that an independent judgment is being brought to bear on the issue. The hon. Gentleman will vote for the motion and against the amendment because he has been told to do so. Whether he is a Euro-fanatic or a Euro-sceptic will not make a ha'porth of difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not opposed the principle of the Bill and we want progress to be made. The debate has been lengthy because of the arrogant attitude of the Minister and his hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not continue. My hon. Friends and I have outlined the position as succinctly as possible. We want to vote on the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South, which is a reasonable and moderate compromise that appeals to many Opposition members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
