	<div class='legislation'>THE PRISON (AMENDMENT) RULES</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Lane</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move.
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the instrument.</p></blockquote>
The Opposition are grateful for the opportunity of a short debate on some aspects of the prison system which are covered by these amendments to the rules. We are not in any way hostile to the amendments. Indeed, the changes were largely prepared by the previous Government, but I should like to ask the hon. Lady one or two questions about them in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were anxious that, at least on this one occasion during the present rather short session, hon. Members on both sides should turn their attention to the prison service. I am sorry that there are not more of our colleagues here this morning to take advantage of this opportunity, but perhaps a few more will come before 12 o'clock which I believe is the latest time to which we may continue the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know that exactly two weeks ago today there was a debate in an other place—a wide-ranging general debate, which we clearly cannot have this morning—about the prison service in general. On the whole, the flavour there was encouraging, the message being that advances are being made in our whole prison system; not dramatic advances, but gradual and steady ones in the right direction, which we hope will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot range as widely this morning as the other place did two weeks ago, but I should like to make one or two brief observations merely as background to the issues raised in these amendments because they affect in a number of important aspects the day-to-day running of our prison system in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first general point I hope I may make, and I hope that hon. Members will agree in this, is that the prison service is one of the most important front-line 24-hours a day responsibilities of Gov-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
ernment. We rightly pay a great deal of attenetion to the problems of prisoners and their families and friends, and in the same way the public and we in this House pay a great deal of attention to the victims of prisoners and their families, but I doubt whether we give enough thought to the prison officers who have to work with these rules and administer them, and who will have to adjust their routines to these amendments, assuming that we agree to send them on their way with our blessing this morning. They have a very difficult and often dangerous job. We depend absolutely on their calibre and morale. The country is greatly in their debt, and I am glad of this chance to express our gratitude to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known that the prison service has been under great strain and stress in terms of numbers and the burden of work in recent years. Is there any up-to-date information about the latest recruiting trends to the prision service? If there is, I am sure we shall all be interested to hear it. Secondly—and here I have in mind the over-crowded nature of some prisons which complicate such things as visiting which, as you know, Mr. Fitch, is covered by one of the amendments — we should be interested in any information which the Government can give us about their latest forecasts of the prison population and about their general plans for prison buildings. I am not suggesting that we can go into this in detail, but as far as I know—and I should be glad if the hon. Lady would at least confirm or correct my understanding—the prison population, with its implications of overcrowding, has been on a plateau of about 37,000, which is somewhat lower than was forecast. It would be excellent news if a turndown were forecast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries us most—and again I have in mind the amendment about visiting, among other things—is that part of the overcrowding problem, which is relevant to visiting and general supervision problems, arises from the fact that nearly half the 37,000 population of our prisons have to live in prisons which were built before the end of the nineteenth century. I hope that the momentum of the prison building programme will be maintained as far as possible so that we can make a real impression within a few years, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
we were starting to do, on the problem of antiquated buildings and overcrowding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My third and last general observation is prompted by the episode of the Price sisters, about which there is undoubtedly some continuing unease in the public mind. I do not expect any comment from the hon. Lady on the matter, but I hope that the Home Secretary will keep a free hand in the location and movement of prisoners. Nothing could be more disastrous for morale inside the prison service or for the reassurance of the general public if the idea gained currency that a Home Secretary could be shifted on any of these vital decisions by any form of blackmail or duress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to the amendments in the rules. I said at the beginning that these were largely worked out by the previous Government. We believe that they are on sound lines, and we are certain that the Committee should approve them. I have one or two points to make, and some questions to ask the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first change has to do with the religious denomination of prisoners. As I understand it, changes in the record of religious denomination are now to be in the Governor's hands. We believe that this is sensible, though the change should be made only, the rule says
	<br><blockquote><p>"in a proper case and after due enquiry".</p></blockquote>
Is there much evidence of abuse? Bogus religious denominations could be dragged into a prisoner's record, and the hon. Lady may like to say something to the Committee about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Change No. 3 in the Statutory Instrument is concerned with the censorship of mail so that in future it will be discretionary and not mandatory for governors to continue the censorship of mail. As I understand it, when this change has been made in any establishment outgoing mail from prisoners to their friends or families will not be read. Incoming mail will be opened but not read, and that is clearly a necessary precaution against the possibility of money, drugs such as LSD, or other strange goods being enclosed with letters. They should clearly be intercepted before the letter gets to the prisoner, and that is how the system will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Presumably the Government intend to extend this discretionary practice gradually, establishment by establishment, on the basis of the experiment which has been going on for about two years in certain open establishments. I am sure that the Committee would appreciate a report from the hon. Lady on how far this has been extended and how much further she proposes to extend it over the next years or two. I am sure that the Committee would accept that where there are any security problems censorship must continue but, subject to that, we greatly welcome the more relaxed atmosphere that this change will bring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, too, the welfare aspect of censorship. Up to now, one of the main usefulnesses of censorship has been that, from time to time, a letter has been a kind of warning to the staff, which they have not had before, of particular problems in a prisoner's life or in his home circumstances. This has enabled helpful action to be taken by the welfare services, and in many cases has led to these problems being solved, obviously for the greater ease of the prisoner. It is therefore essential that where censorship is no longer being applied there is some other way in which the welfare services can come to hear, in good time, of any developing problems of this kind. I wonder whether we may have a reassurance on that aspect from the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 in the Statutory Instrument deals with the frequency of visits. Here again the rules are being relaxed, and we welcome this. Clearly, visiting is, and always will be, one of the main sources of hope for prisoners. The greatest incentive of all is, of course, the possibility of parole. I doubt whether the Government want to say anything about the recent annual report of the Parole Board, but if the hon. Lady has any initial reactions to its interesting report we should be glad to hear them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This change is already in force, and it has increased the frequency of visits to adult convicted prisoners to a minimum of one visit in every four weeks, instead of one visit in every eight weeks. This is merely giving statutory effect to the general practice in the prison service, and it is of the greatest importance that this change should work smoothly. I am
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
thinking here not only of the prisoners and what it means to them, their friends and families, but to the staff who administer the prisons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One obvious difficulty is that the weekend, which for the families and friends of prisoners is the best visiting time, is the least suitable and least convenient time to provide extra supervision for people moving to and fro, particularly in the crowded prisons about which we were talking about. One has, of course, to bear in mind the obvious difference between, for example, busy local prisons where there are complications about visits at any time, and training prisons with more stable populations from different parts of the country where the complications are fewer. Perhaps the hon. Lady may be able to tell us something about how this will to work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister would say something about travel warrants for prisoners' families. I understand that it has been the practice for these to be issued where necessary by the Department of Health and Social Security for visits once a month. This point was raised by Lady Sharples in her maiden speech two weeks ago in the debate in the other place, when she pressed for the more frequent issue of warrants, or at any rate a simplification of the procedure. On reading her speech I thought that there was a lot in this, and although it may be too soon to get any Government reaction this morning we should be interested to hear whether the hon. Lady has anything to say on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 contains the package of changes in the rules which have to do with offences against prison discipline. Our objective—and we welcome very much that this has been carried on by the present Government—is to get greater flexibility in the discipline system. I am sure this is right, and I have only a few points to make here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee realises, the punishment of a restricted diet of bread and water is out. In its time it certainly had some usefulness, but it is an antiquated form of punishment and, on balance, I am sure that we are better to be rid of it. The Committee will have noticed that in other respects some of the penalties are being increased; the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
most obvious is the increase in the prison governor's powers over the stoppage of earnings or forfeiture of remission, which is raised at his discretion from 14 days to 28 days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Rule 53 deals with the novel idea of giving greater incentives to prisoners who are doing work and thereby earning money. It is interesting to note that the Government have chosen the method of a percentage reduction in the earnings that may be kept by a prisoner over a period. An alternative would have been a specific stoppage or fine of so many pence, or £1, or whatever it might have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought stopping a specific amount would have had a greater incentive effect than the percentage system which the Government have adopted. I admit that this is more flexible than the previous arrangement, but there is still an element of rigidity in reducing what can be earned by up to X per cent. Would the hon. Lady like to comment on why the Government finally decided on this method, rather than the other? How does she foresee it working out in practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last comment is on the new Rule No. 54, which is about the forfeiture of remission. A prospective loss of remission will provide a new power to deal with anyone who is temporarily in prison while on remand awaiting trial or sentence, or who has been guilty of gross indiscipline or caused trouble. In the few cases where it may apply—and these can be troublesome cases—it will also prove a useful deterrent, and I hope that it will work well in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope all the changes will work out successfully in practice, because I know how much thought has been given to them in the Home Office, particularly in the prison department. I hope the hon. Lady will confirm that there will be further reviews, at whatever intervals are necessary, on these and other matters which are so important to the smooth day-to-day running of prisons and to the feelings and way of life of prisoners and their friends and families, not forgetting the prison officers whom I mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We look forward to a reduction in the prison population at the earliest date for which one can hope. One cannot allege
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
that this Government or any other Government can directly control that, but we are interested in the suggestions and the general trend of opinion in favour of fewer custodial sentences and the wider, more experimental, non-custodial treatment of prisoners. I am sure that is the direction in which we must go. We look forward in general to a continuing improvement in the administration of the prison system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it might be helpful to hon. Members if I say that if we were to discuss future prison building programmes we should be going a little wide of the instrument. I allowed the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mr. Lane) to the subject because it had the vaguest of vague references to visiting but any debate upon it would be out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (Dr. Shirley Summer-skill)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may reply to the hon. Member for Cambridge (Mr. Lane) now and after listening to the other speakers have a few minutes at the end to reply to any points that are raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving the Committee the opportunity of discussing the statutory instrument and the new rules. I assure him that the Government do not regard penal policy as in any way static. It is a dynamic subject, and we must constantly be able to adapt to take advantage of new experience and new ideas that are put forward. There should be total flexibility not only of attitude but in the regulations and rules. This is an example of the flexibility shown by the previous Government, and we are carrying it on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prisons vary enormously. There are more than 100 prison establishments of different kinds, employing nearly 20,000 people and having about 37,000 inmates. I join the hon. Gentleman in his tribute to prison officers who have the admiration of everyone in the work that they are doing. I shall let the hon. Gentleman know the recruiting trends to the prison services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are constantly reviewing and experimenting. The debate in the other place is being studied very carefully, and all the different suggestions made there will be studied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The prison population exceeded 40,000 during part of 1970 and part of 1971. It fell gradually during 1972 and 1973, but since then the population has risen again and now stands at 36,586. That was the figure at 15th June 1974, and it is about 300 fewer than this time last year. The reduction in the population has been mainly in the adult male sentenced population serving short-term and medium-term sentences, and also in the number of young men sentenced to borstal. Over recent years there has, unfortunately, been an increase in the number of males under 17 sentenced to detention in junior detention centres. Although I say "unfortunately" this does reflect the increase in the number of places available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most recent public statement in the OFFICIAL REPORT concerning population forecasts was made by the hon. and learned Member for Runcorn (Mr. Carlisle) when he announced that the prison population was unlikely to exceed 42,000 by the end of the decade. Forecasts are under review all the time in the light of the movement of the prison population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with certain specific points regarding the rules. I refer first to religion, which was the point raised by the hon. Gentleman. I am not aware that this is a widespread problem or one with which the prison authorities find it difficult to cope. The rule was intended to make the registration of religion flexible. For instance, there have been a number of instances where young prisoners have claimed to be Sikhs in order to be allowed to wear their hair long. At least one prisoner has claimed to be a Jew. That may have been in order to take advantage of the special holiday periods or diet, I do not know, but the rabbi, doubting that he was Jewish, felt difficulty in admitting him to religious celebrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A different problem is that of claims to membership of groups. Some people claim that they are Rastafarians, Black Muslims or Scientologists, so clearly there must be some flexibility in the rules about the registration of religion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arnold Shaw</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a certain religion is registered but is not admitted, what about registration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, this would be done in close consultation with the prisoner involved. If he insisted that he was a Sikh and nothing could shift him from that belief, that could be considered. This provision makes for flexibility, so that what someone registered as when he goes into prison is not necessarily what he is regarded as 15 years later if he is still there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The results of the experiment in limited censorship at certain open establishments have been encouraging. In the last two years censorship has been abolished in three open prisons, an open borstal and three open establishments for women and girls. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a detailed reply on what the effect of the censorship is or has been. As I said, it is encouraging and, when one considers how long pr sons have been going, two or three years in the life of prisons is not all that long. But clearly this is the start of the relaxation of censorship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from welfare considerations, it is obviously necessary in the interests of justice, so as to prevent attempts to deceive the court and, which is very important, in the interests of security, that there should be censorship among the high security prisoners. The relaxation of censorship would naturally have to take these factors into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Censorship gave no guarantee that serious welfare problems would necessarily be brought to the notice of the staff, even when it was carried out. In cases where censorship has been abolished, prisoners have shown more self-reliance in tackling their own domestic problems and have in general sought advice when necessary, which is encouraging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards assisted visits, the Department of Health and Social Security at present assesses and gives financial assistance to prisoners' relatives who qualify for supplementary benefit, but it is unable to do so for the additional numbers who would be involved in the several extensions of the scheme now under consideration. These extensions involve cases where there are sentences of three months or less, cases where prisons allow visits more frequently than monthly, and cases where the relatives have full-time earnings not in excess of supple-
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
mentary benefit level. In these' last cases, assistance is at present provided by the probation service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Officials at the Home Office and the Department of Health and Social Security are studying ways of overcoming these difficulties, which mainly involve staffing. If a solution to the practical problem can be found, we have then to consider whether, in the present climate, financial provision for these improvements can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to new Rule 53. The concept of a fine presents practical difficulties as well as problems of equity for implementation in the prison context. The problem is to assess the amount to be specified in relation to the expected earnings of different prisoners at different times, but earnings can vary from 35p at the minimum to £1·89 or more with overtime. Also the job that a prisoner is doing varies; he does not necessarily stay at the same job week after week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the aim of this change in the rule is for the prisoner to retain an interest in the level of his earnings, it was thought simpler and more equitable to fine him an appropriate proportion of his earnings than to set a fixed sum. The effect of this will vary according to the kind of work he is doing in the period following the award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards new Rule 54 about loss of remission, I have noted the comments which the hon. Gentleman made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.59 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had some experience of prison, having served two terms of imprisonment and being a prison chaplain, so I can look at this matter from both aspects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome very much the change of Rule 10, because a prisoner should not have the ordeal of going before a board of visitors to explain why he wants to change his religious affiliation. The fact that the governor will have no decision to make in this matter is a change of rule which will be acceptable to the majority of prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the hon. Lady some questions. Can a prisoner be denied visits as a form of punishment? The Press has stated on various occasions that some prisoners have been denied visits as a form of punishment. I cannot
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
see anything in these rules about that. Perhaps the hon. Lady will clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can a convicted prisoner wear his own clothes? If so, under what circumstances? This is another matter that has been ventilated recently in the Press. Can a prisoner be denied access to his own religious services in the prison, as a form of punishment? Those are three questions which it would be helpful if the hon. Lady could answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other matter that disturbs me, and that is the locking up of remand prisoners. A remand prisoner, after all, has not been charged. He is still innocent in the eyes of the law, yet in the prisons today remand prisoners spend lengthy periods in their cells. Under what rules can a remand prisoner be kept in a cell? Many of them are kept in their cells for 22 hours every day. If there is a long period of remand of say, 3, 4, 6 and even 11 months, the situation needs to be looked into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, pay tribute to those who work in the prison services. They do a very good job indeed, and the relationship between prisoners and warders is generally very good. Many of the warders take an active interest in the welfare of prisoners, and I feel that I should pay my tribute to these men and women who do a very good and necessary job in our communal life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.2 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stanley Newens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the proposals which take into account a number of instances of modern thinking and experiences. There are one or two points which I should like to raise. We all agree that rules must take into account the welfare of the prisoners and the aim of rehabilitating them, and also the prison officers who have a very difficult task to carry out and who are often able to contribute considerably to the rehabilitation of prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first point concerns correspondence. I welcome the change proposed, but I wonder whether my hon. Friend can say anything about a prisoner's right to communicate with his Member of Parliament. Prisoners are frequently people who have moved about very considerably in the community. The address at which a prisoner happens to be living just prior to his sentence may be a temporary one. In those circumstances, he may know
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
nothing about the Member of Parliament who sits for the constituency in which that address is situated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know from my own experience that, in certain circumstances, once a prisoner has written to one Member of Parliament he has considerable difficulty in communicating with another Member. It would be wrong to allow prisoners to have their cases taken up by a number of different Members of Parliament, but we should give prisoners the opportunity to change and allow the prison authorities to exercise a certain amount of discretion, provided that the prisoner himself eventually decides which Member of Parliament he want to represent him. Perhaps my hon. Friend can say something about this problem which, I assure her, has arisen in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem on which I should like my hon. Friend to comment arises from the overcrowding of prisons. We know that prisoners are often placed in cells with other prisoners with whom they have no previous acquaintance. Sometimes this means that a prisoner is forced to spend most of his time in the company of a fellow prisoner with entirely different interests and outlook, and this makes it difficult for him to pursue activities which might help in his rehabilitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of a prisoner who was confined as a result of activities which are not generally thought of as indicating a criminal propensity. He was forced to share a cell with a prisoner who was intent on practising the guitar whenever he was allowed to. That may amuse hon. Members, but when it went on day after day the other prisoner was driven almost into a state of dementia, particularly as he wished to study quietly. I realise the difficulties, and I accept that prisoners are undergoing punishment, but the objective in prisons should be to rehabilitate prisoners and we should have some regard to the conditions under which they are confined. Can my hon. Friend say something about this?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, I should like to raise the question of the opportunity for study. We know that prisoners have certain opportunities for that purpose, but cases have been brought to my notice of prisoners encountering difficulties in pursuing their chosen studies. Objections have been made to their carrying out the desired form of study.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
I do not know whether my connections with prisoners have been particularly in the sphere of music, but I know of another prisoner who wished to study the guitar. He wanted to make his own guitar, but he was prevented from doing so on the grounds that the materials that he wished to use might be used to help him to escape or make offensive weapons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must, of course, take into account the various subterfuges that are used by prisoners who are intent on pursuing not genuine studies or activties but some line of conduct which would be completely unacceptable, but there are prisoners who regard themselves as having been discriminated against and persecuted in this way, and I wonder whether arrangements could be made so that, within reason, prisoners are able to pursue their desired courses of study and activity provided that they do not conflict with the objectives of prison discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that I have gone a little wide of the rules in certain respects, but these are important issues and we are concerned with the rehabilitation of prisoners. Other hon. Members will have been faced, as I have on many occasions, with inquiries from prisoners. I have not had the benefit—which one hon. Member has had—of experiencing conditions as the inmate of any institution, but I have visited one prison and I was very concerned about some of the conditions that I saw there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extremely important that we should bear in mind all the time not only the objectives of security and of enabling the prison to function, but the need to rehabilitate prisoners and avoid the brutalisation that can take place. It is in this sense that I have raised these issues, and I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to comment on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.11 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Atkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to follow the reference by the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) to religion in prisons except to say, and perhaps he agrees with me, that there seems to be more discussion of comparative religion in prison than outside, with the possible exception of Ulster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise the need for visits to be as frequent as possible. From what we have heard, it seems that the practice
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
of one visit every four weeks is ahead of the statute, and I should like to know whether, now that the statute has caught up with the practice, the practice will progress further, and whether, where possible, governors will allow and encourage more frequent visits than one in four weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, this is the only hope that men in prison have, and it is very often their only contact with the outside world. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage relatives to visit by providing them with warrants and sometimes even by assisting them to find accommodation if they have to travel long distances. Some of my constituents have to travel from Preston to Dartmoor, and it so burdens some of them that they keep on asking for prisoners to be transferred to Preston prison, which is one of the worst in the country from the point of view of age because it was built during the Napoleonic wars. That stresses the importance of accessability to prisoners. When new prisons are built they need not be in towns, but they should be accessible to public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very glad that censorship is to be limited, presumably to high security cases, because this has caused a good deal of distress to prisoners. Girl friends and wives of prisoners frequently write expressing their affection, and sometimes more elemental desires. As many of the writers are not all that literate, certain crudities appear in the letters, and the less kind warders pass that on to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I know from prison warders to whom I have spoken this causes a great deal of distress. It discourages such communication in which feelings are genuinely and simply expressed, and in any way crude. It discourages communication if both parties to the correspondence realise that their letters are being censored, and it causes a great deal of distress and pain. I am glad that there is to be a relaxation of this kind of censorship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.14 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alf Bates</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, broadly welcome these changes in rules but I should like briefly to ask my hon. Friend a number of questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like, first, to follow on from what my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) said about a prisoners' accessibility to his Member
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
of Parliament. As far as correspondence is concerned, it is clear that most prisoners would not know the name of their Member of Parliament, but I assume that they would be supplied with necessary information if they asked for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that the outgoing mail of high security prisoners should be checked and possibly censored in some way, but does this apply to letters to Members of Parliament? If it does, is it really necessary that it should? Surely there are matters which a prisoner ought to be allowed to raise with his Member of Parliament which should not be viewed or censored by prison authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does a prisoner under punishment have his rights to a visit from his Member of Parliament curtailed in any way? As I understand the situation, if a Member of Parliament wants to have a discussion with a prisoner, that has to take place in the presence of the governor, the assistant-governor of the prison, or some other senior officer. Is that really necessary? Are there not matters which a prisoner might wish to raise with his Member of Parliament about the running of the prison and the way that he is being treated in prison which ought properly to be discussed privately between them? Is it really necessary for an officer to be present during the discussion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Which of these punishments can apply to prisoners under the age of 21? Can all prisoners under 21 have visits to them refused for certain offences? Can the right of worship be refused them? Is it possible for their right to study to be removed as a punishment? I am sure we are all concerned to ensure that young prisoners, particularly those inside for the first time, do not immediately become involved with older prisoners and get dragged in to the evil net of prison. Therefore, we ought to pay particular attention to their problems. We ought, for example, to try to keep them away from the older prisoners and not immediately push them into the difficulties that might arise if they were to suffer many of these punishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the suggested amendments, but should like a reply to those few questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.18 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Max Madden</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have four points to make. I endorse many of the com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
ments made by my hon. Friends, and therefore I shall not repeat them. Can my hon. Friend tell me what steps are taken to inform prisoners of these and other regulations? Secondly, what appeal procedures are there against the various regulations? Thirdly, paragraphs 52 (1) (
	<i>b</i>) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"gross personal violence to an officer"</p></blockquote>
I am not certain about this, but I believe that the usual charge in the courts is causing actual or grievous bodily harm. I wondered whether there might be some merit in bringing this paragraph into line with charges which are known in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, may I ask that certain of the rules be amended, including 51(1)(
	<i>c</i>) 51(5), 52(1)(b) and 56(1), where it is assumed that the Secretary of State shall for all time to be a male?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a variety of questions with which to deal. I shall start by answering the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley). I thank him for his informed questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Rule 34(5) dealing with the denial of visits as a form of punishment, a governor may defer the right to visits of a convicted prisoner when he is undergoing an award of cellular confinement. This is a punishment. It can last as long as 56 days. Unconvicted prisoners may have as many visits as it is practicable to allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the wearing of clothes by convicted prisoners, men must wear prison clothing but women can wear their own clothes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding denial of access to religious services, normally there is no difficulty, but for practical, including security, reasons it may sometimes be necessary to deny access to corporate worship. It is possible for a prisoner's facilities for worship to be in private. The priest, rabbi or clergyman would come to the cell. The sacraments are made readily available, there is never any question of denial of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Long periods during which remand prisoners are locked in cells are sometimes unavoidable, because of staff shortages, which make it impossible to have everyone wandering round adequately supervised. We should certainly like to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0665">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
have as little unnecessary confinement as possible, and to that end possible changes in bail procedures may help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the point made by the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens). I agree that sometimes a prisoner does not know who his MP is, but if I receive a letter from someone who is not my constituent and I can locate the address of the prisoner, assuming he has one, I refer it to the proper Member of Parliament. The governor would attempt to inform the prisoner of his Member of Parliament, unless he is homeless, in which case it will be the Member for the constituency which contains the prison concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no restrictions on which Member a prisoner may write to. There is nothing normally to stop him from writing to any Member, but it is preferable, if possible, for him to write to his own. If my hon. Friend has a particular case in mind, where there is a difficulty, perhaps he will let me know the details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a particular case in mind at the moment, but I have had experience of this sort of thing in the past. I can cite one case. It happened in 1970. A prisoner eventually communicated with me, having had his letters stopped, by somehow informing another prisoner, who was released and got in touch with me when he was out of prison. Subsequently I wrote and obtained some sort of connection with the prisoner who was trying to contact me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what my hon. Friend says is correct. I can assure her that in the past prisoners in certain cases have been prevented from writing to Members of Parliament. I do not object to certain restrictions. There is a convention which is normally observed, but I think that some degree of flexibility ought to be available in the type of cases with which we are all familiar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. It is always difficult to deal with generalisations. If any hon. Member has specific cases with names, it is easier for me to take them up. This applies to a further point the hon. Mem-
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
ber made, to which I shall come in a minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid there is still a lot of overcrowding. I am staggered by the fact that from 1908 to 1958 no new prisons were built. We are inheriting all these old prisons; no new ones were built at all during those 50 years. Therefore, there are still 12,000 inmates sleeping two or three to a cell, but primarily in local prisons. We are doing everything possible to improve the situation. The governors try, on the advice of the prison officers, to put together people who seem to get on. They use their judgment. I hope that the case of the guitar player and the student who were put in the same cell was looked into. I hope that one or other of them complained either to the governor or to the board of visitors and that something was done, because otherwise it was clearly bad management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the hon. Member summed up quite well the question of opportunity for study. If somebody wants to make his own rope or keys, and if security is involved, one questions whether this is a form of study. But if he insists on doing this, it could perhaps be done in the workshop under supervision. I do not have the details about the guitar maker, but if he is desperate to make his own guitar I suppose he, too could build it in the workship in normal working hours under supervision. He would not necessarily have to do it in his cell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Newens</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting to my hon. Friend that we should introduce into prisons courses for locksmiths, or anything of that sort. I recognise this problem, but I think that discretion must be exercised and on some occasions perhaps sympathy has not been exercised towards prisoners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I shall willingly look into any individual case that hon. Members raise. My hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) suggested that there should be more visits. I agree that one a month may not seem much, but we come back to the staffing problem again. Visits have to be supervised and organised, and in a big prison with a limited number of prison officers it is not always easy.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Clearly some progress is being made. I agree that it should be possible to reach new prisons by public transport.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have said in the rules, censorship is discretionary and not mandatory, which is a great step forward. This is the beginning of more reforms, I hope, in future. We must see how we get on and learn by experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port (Mr. Bates) raised the question of the censorship of Members' letters. This has a long history. Under the present rules, where there are complaints against prison treatment it is only right and fair that they should be ventilated in the ordinary way, so that the people being complained against have a right to know why a complaint is being made against them. A prisoner can always petition the Home Secretary to remedy the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Visits from Members of Parliament, as far as I know, are not limited. Provided that a Member of Parliament does not want to go, say, four or five times a day, he can go whenever he wishes. For security reasons there is normally an officer present during a visit to any prisoner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a prison chaplain visits a prison he sees the prisoner on his own. Should not a Member of Parliament also have this privilege? After all, the warder is outside the door and it is usually a glass door so they are both under observation. Does not the hon. Lady think that, as a minister of religion has the privilege of visiting a prisoner on his own, that a prisoner's Member of Parliament should have the same opportunity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any case of a Member of Parliament insisting on seeing a prisoner on his own. I am wondering whether, if a Member of Parliament did insist, the governor would not, in his wisdom, agree to it. I have not come across such a case, but that is certainly a possibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Bebington and Ellesmere Port that, wherever possible young prisoners do not mix with prisoners serving very long sentences for severe crimes. The borstal boys are kept separate and generally the short-sentence prisoners are kept separate from the long-sentence prisoners. As far
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
as possible within the limits of security, the rights of study and worship are not removed as punishments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am of necessity making generalisations because the comments made have been generalisations. But we must remember that every prisoner is an individual who has committed a crime and is serving a sentence. The governor, the prison officers and the board of visitors know the prisoners. General rules cannot cover every specific case. The reason for having flexible rules is that they can be adapted to individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Madden) asked how the rules are made known to the prisoner. They are put up in the cell so that he can read them every day, and he probably knows them by heart. There is no question of his not knowing what they are. Obviously, the amended rules will be put up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of appeal procedures concerning regulations, the prisoner can make a complaint to the board of visitors or to the governor about prison regulations or conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are prison punishments for offences against regulations, but if someone committed a criminal offence in prison, which is far more serious, it would be dealt with by the courts. Again, one cannot generalise. If Rule 47(2) were to cover all forms of criminal offence involving personal violence, it would need to be very much longer and would therefore be more open to difficulties of interpretation. But serious cases would be taken to the courts in the usual way. I have noted the point about a female Home Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bates</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to be troublesome, but may I return to the question of the discussion which a prisoner has with his Member of Parliament to which the hon. Member for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) referred. Surely it would be better, rather than a Member of Parliament suggesting to the governor that he might see the prisoner in private, if that was the norm. My hon. Friend said that if a Member of Parliament asked the governor he might be allowed to see the prisoner in private. It may be that governors do not know that that is what the Home Office has in mind. Would it not be better if it were accepted that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1974-1974V005P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Members of Parliament could see prisoners in private?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most sympathetic to the point. One thought has occurred to me, apart from security. The presence of a third party is sometimes desirable if there are going to be allegations made after the interview by the prisoner that the Member promised or said certain things which he had neither promised nor said. For the Member's personal advantage it might be useful in some cases to have a witness to the conversation so that false allegations are not made. I shall certainly look into this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bates</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of my constituents regularly suggest that I have said certain things which I did not say. It applies to many people who are not in prison.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for the trouble she has taken to give full answers, not only to my questions, but the other questions that have been raised.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still concerned about remand prisoners. Would it be possible to look into the situation whereby remand prisoners could, if they wanted, take part in prison employment? Many of them would prefer to be out of their cell following the usual routine of the prison day rather than have one hour of exercise in the morning and one in the evening and 22 hours in the cell. Remand prisoners pray for the day when they will be charged and sentenced rather than have to remain in confinement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Summerskill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a policy matter that they should not work. Ideally we should like them to be working, but there is a staff shortage.
