	<i>Amendment moved</i> [
	<i>this day</i>]: No. 220, in page 14, line 22, after "show", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"the actual value given to the dwelling by the listing officer and".— [
	<i>Mr. Maxton.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Dawn Primarolo 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), speaking before lunch, used an old saying. Sometimes old sayings cause offence. Many are sexist. My hon. Friend used the phrase "all fur coat and nae knickers". That caused an outcry among Conservative Members. Perhaps "all mouth and trousers" would be more appropriate to a male-dominated House of Commons. To translate the phrase used by my hon. Friend into proper, inoffensive language, it means all show and no substance. That is a good description of the fake Conservative outrage at the suspected sexism of my hon. Friend's contribution as well as of the council tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a different point of order, Sir Michael. Members of the Committee have just received a press release about the council tax benefit scheme. The information is welcome, but it is unfortunate that the Committee was forced to waste time on Tuesday trying to elicit the information from Ministers, who refused to provide it. The statement that we have just received was not vouchsafed to the Committee directly; it was issued at a press conference a few moments ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we wished to debate the contents of the press release, we would doubtless be told that we could not do so until the Committee considered schedule 9. However, schedule 9 is in the last group intended for guillotined debate. Precedent implies that we shall have no time in which to debate it. We made unavailing attempts to persuade Ministers to tell us about the proposals and they refused. They have given the information that we requested to a press conference, in circumstances that make it impossible for the Committee to debate the press release. The guillotine will ensure that the issues cannot be debated adequately. Can I invite Ministers to comment on that through you, Sir Michael?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstances, I shall allow a short comment from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Robert Key)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Sir Michael. The hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) makes several interesting assertions. The Government have wished for some time to provide members of the Committee and a wider audience with the information. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security for sorting out the system in good time for the debate on schedule 9, which will take place next week. I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) who tabled the relevant parliamentary question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The information was not presented in a cavalier manner only to the press—far from it. It was in the form of a parliamentary question that was answered at half-past three. We did what we could for the convenience of the Committee to ensure that it had the text of the question in advance of the publication of 
	<i>Hansard</i> tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not strictly a point of order. There is nothing that any of us can do about it. The order in which we take the clauses and the schedules is laid down for us in the guillotine motion. Looking at the timetable, I should have thought that, as schedule 9 is in the last group, with a little skill from the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) it could be reached. However, that is not a matter for me. The way in which we proceed has been laid down. We are on course, and I have allowed a short exchange, but we must get on with our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a slightly different point of order, Sir Michael, which flows from your ruling on the previous point of order. I understand that the guillotine motion is beyond either your or our control, but because of it we are constantly forced to choose how we use the time allocated. Any time that we would use for a debate on schedule 9 would be at the expense of debate on another equally important subject. That is the problem that the Committee faces as a consequence of the guillotine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you referred to your excellent guidance and control of the proceedings, Sir Michael, I should like you to comment on allegations in today's papers that, when trying to make the best of a difficult situation, my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) filibustered and that he was accused of doing so by the Chairman. I think that you will agree, Sir Michael—I should appreciate your ruling on this point—that my hon. Friend was not at any time accused by Mr. Leadbitter of speaking in an irrelevant manner or of filibustering. Indeed, he congratulated my hon. Friend on the excellence and relevance of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will you also confirm, Sir Michael, that any allegation of filibustering can only be an implied criticism of the Chair? It is especially inappropriate and offensive when it comes from someone who is not a member of the Committee, has at no stage been present at any of its proceedings and is clearly making these wild and irresponsible allegations to score political points to the disadvantage of the Chair and my hon. Friend's reputation. May I have your ruling on that matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Matters of opinion expressed outside the Committee are not my responsibility. Should it involve a matter in which the law might be invoked, I might seek retirement from the House at an earlier date than I expected. But I do not believe that the comments were as devastating as that. Such matters are part of the rough and tumble of politics. Other hon. Members may be disposed to talk about other things at other times, so we could have points of order every day. Perhaps we should get on with our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to the point of order, Sir Michael. On point of fact, it would help to resolve this unfortunate episode if you would confirm that at no point was my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside brought to order by Mr. Leadbitter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to judge my colleague's conduct of affairs. I am sure that everything was entirely in order. The record speaks for itself and any hon. Member can refer to it. Now let us proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not use the phrase that I used earlier. I used it when I referred to the rating and valuation—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. I have now managed to get hold of the record which the hon. Member for Dagenham was using. Mr. Leadbitter said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He is considerably out of order".—[
	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 26 November 1991; c. 467.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a matter for me. Let us leave the matter there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I used that old Glasgow expression, to which my hon. Friend referred in her point of order, when I said that one of the assumptions when valuing a property for the selling price that would obtain on 1 April 1991 is that the property is in a state of reasonable repair. That provoked Conservative Members to react as though that is what they had been saying all along. I used that expression to impress on them that some people keep the outside of their houses looking good, whereas the inside is in a state of disrepair. It is easy to paint the outside to attract potential buyers who will at least start with the right impression, even though the inside may be a disaster area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that no Conservative Member would consider purchasing a house without sending in a surveyor not only to do a valuation, but to ensure that the house is in a proper state of repair. Will the Under-Secretary reply to the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good. I am glad to hear that; perhaps the hon. Gentleman will now pay attention to what I am saying. Would the Under-Secretary buy a house by simply walking past it and then slapping down a cheque on the estate agent's table? The answer, of course, is that he would not; he would send in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
surveyor because he would want to know whether the estate agent's valuation is correct and also to determine whether the house is in a state of reasonable repair. The Under-Secretary would expect his surveyor to go into the roof space to ensure that the joists and joints are fine, to check for dry or damp rot and to examine the floorboards. The council tax will be based on a valuation of property in a state of reasonable repair. Even in Scotland, two thirds of the houses will not be examined internally. The implication is that the numbers will be greater in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not require a full valuation. I shall return to that matter when we discuss the clauses dealing with Scotland. We want the banding system to include the valuation price within the bands. For example, a house falling into band C could have its valuation specified as, say, £43,500. I am sure that the Government will say that that would complicate the issue, but I think that it would solve many administrative problems later. We assume that every house will have an individual valuation—not an inspection, but a price set by surveyors and assessors. That should be listed because it would prevent many appeals from taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Someone whose house is valued within band C could assume that it comes at the bottom end of the band and so decide to appeal to have it transferred into the band below. But if the price listed is in the higher part of the band, people might assume that they would not achieve a reduction of £10,000 and simply ignore it. The amendment would not require an individual valuation but would allow the council tax to be administered more sensibly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the avoidance of doubt, it may be helpful it I reply to the points that were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We made it clear that we see great advantage in a banded approach to the valuations, and I do not propose to repeat all those arguments. However, one point requires repeating and that is that a banded system does not require precise valuation. I am sure that that is one reason why the Labour party does not reject it outright. Valuers will need only to establish in which of the broad bands each property should be placed. That will be quicker and cheaper than producing price figures that give a spurious air of precision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The valuations called for in the amendment do not need to be known and will not be known. If such precise valuations were provided there would be a flood of appeals, even though a change in a valuation will rarely lead to a change in bands. With the bands we propose, people will quickly recognise whether their property has been assigned to the correct band. That will ensure that the number of appeals is kept to a minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition may be keen to support the amendment to slow down the valuation and so delay the introduction of the council tax, but we will not countenance that. Of course, even the delay that would be caused by the amendment does not bear comparison with the time that would be needed to introduce Labour's scheme. If Labour Members had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0363">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
their way, we would have the four contradictory factors of" valuation which are laid out on page 3 of the Labour party document "Fair Rates". As the Minister of State said, Mr. Rolling Revaluation would arrive bearing valuers to cope with market price, rebuilding costs, maintenance and repair costs and private rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) quoted extensively from the extract from the third report, session 1991–92, of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, concerned with the Domestic Property (Valuation) Regulations 1991 and the Domestic Property (Valuation) (Scotland) Regulations. He missed an important point, however, and it relates to the nub of his argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Department agrees with the Committee's view that a real buyer will be influenced by the actual condition of a property when making an offer for it. I would not walk down a street and say, "I want that house", and write a cheque for it. No sensible person would do that. The asking price would reflect the state of repair of a property. However, that does not appear to be the matter to which regulation 2(5) relates. That asks what a notional buyer would regard as a reasonable condition of a property, taking account of its age, character and locality but disregarding its actual condition which, in a real transaction, a purchaser would obviously take into account in deciding what he was prepared to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the phrase "state of reasonable repair". Other legislation dealing with property refers to it being in "reasonable repair" such as, for example, section 498B of the Housing Act 1985 and section 115(3) of the superseding provisions of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. The phrase "reasonable state of repair" is commonly used by us all in everyday speech; but technically, one should apply the word "reasonable" to "repair" and not to "state". As the expression is defined, the Department would agree with the point that appears implicit in the Committee's second question: that, in the context of the regulations, it does not matter which phrase is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cathcart is confused between the everyday language which he or I would use in describing the state of a house and what the law has refined in its definition. I am convinced not only that this clause is the rolling revaluation part of our debates but that we are dealing with the Gilbert and Sullivan amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities said this morning, a problem with the rolling revaluation is that people will chip the paint of their front doors to make sure that their properties are not valued upwards. I am reminded of Sir Joseph, the Admiral in "HMS Pinafore", who sang:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When I was a lad I served a term—"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sing it!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would, but I understand that singing is out of order in Committee. I do not want you, Sir
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
Michael, to rule me out of order, so I hope that hon. Members will bear with me for a minute.
	<br><blockquote><p>"When I was a lad I served a term</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As office boy to an Attorney's firm.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I cleaned the windows and I swept the floor,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And I polished up the handle of the big front door.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I polished up that handle so carefulee</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>I always voted at my party's call</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And I never thought of thinking for myself at all.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I thought so little they rewarded me</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>By making me the ruler of the Queen's Navee!</p></blockquote>
—[Hon. Members: "Encore!"] Rolling revaluations would not enhance any system of taxation and I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the third method of reply that Ministers can employ, and to be fair that is the first time this Committee has heard it. The first method is to abuse the Opposition. We are used to that. The second method is to repeat what is in the Bill as if it were a magic formula. The third method is to enter into a mass of gobbledygook that means nothing. That is what we have just heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can find any references in the housing Acts that he mentioned to the phrase "reasonable state of repair", he is a better reader than me. I think that they must be written in invisible ink, because I cannot find them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course such references are there. That is why I sought to help the hon. Gentleman so that I could explain why he was wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a definition of "state of reasonable repair", but it does not refer to such a definition in any other Act. Yet it is that definition that will be on the statute book and that people will use to interpret the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not propose a single valuation of every property, nor a rolling valuation. When a valuation is performed, it is included in a list and banded. All we propose is that a price be included in the list as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister believes that everything is wonderful, but the first assumption is that any sale will be made with vacant possession. How can a valuer walking down a street know that a house has vacant possession? It is impossible. How can one tell whether a house is rented out? Moreover, no council house can be valued according to that assumption, because it is owned by the council and is rented. There is not vacant possession in that case. That is why council house tenants are to be gien a discount—the value is lower without vacant possession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is labouring under a misapprehension. It is common for valuers to make such assumptions and they will value such a property as if it had vacant possession. That is perfectly normal. I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman does not know much about valuation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give the Minister an example. My brother was a solicitor who handled an estate,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0364">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
part of which was a house in London. I went to see it because it had a very low price. But renting part of the house was an elderly person who had possession of part of the property, and the price and value of the house was pushed downward accordingly. If I sent someone to value that house, I should be told that the value with vacant possession would be X, but without it the value would be Y. The assumption will always be that there must be vacant possession, even if that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 155, in page 16, leave out lines 18 to 20.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous group of amendments and this one are related. We propose an adjustment to clause 24 to allow for a revaluation of properties when reasonable or substantial improvements have been made. We can produce examples to explain why we tabled the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 24(10) refers to "material increase" and planning permission. The Bill includes caravans and boats as residences. Substantial changes can be made to caravans and boats without planning permission and their value can increase greatly when they are improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A caravan can be replaced on a site with one that has luxury fittings. A moored boat that is a residential dwelling does not need planning permission because it is merely replacing an existing dwelling. Are we to understand that whatever the increase in price of such dwellings, there will be no change in the valuations until they have been sold? The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland nods in approval. The proposal will create enormous anomalies, especially when people living in low-value properties of less than £40,000 pay the same in council tax as people living in luxury caravans or boats. People will appeal because of the injustice and unfairness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is to require dwellings to be revalued when substantial alterations are carried out that would increase the value of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
properties in question. The Secretary of State may make regulations under clause 24 requiring listing officers to alter valuation lists in particular circumstances—given in subsection (4)—which are that
	<br><blockquote><p>"(i) there has been a material increase in the value of the dwelling and a relevant transaction has been subsequently carried out in relation to it; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(ii) there has been a material reduction in the value of the dwelling".</p></blockquote>
According to clause 24, prescribed conditions must be fulfilled. The terms "material increase", "material reduction" and "relevant transaction" are defined in subsection (10).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a major difference between those two conditions. If the value has increased, revaluation takes place only when the dwelling is sold or when the lease changes hands, whereas if the value has decreased the revaluation takes place immediately. It would seem that there is again a mismatch in the Bill's application. I feel sure that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will answer that point when he replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Bowis 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman put his anxiety into context? Can he tell us the average cost of the caravans and how often it is likely that a change of caravan would put someone in a different band of council tax? It seems that the changes are likely to be comparatively small and that crossing a band threshold is unlikely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you, Sir Michael, could speak in the debate, you would be able to explain further. Your constituency of Scarborough covers a wide area with many caravan parks. Some of those caravans are worth between £80,000 and £90,000. The caravans of the travelling people are the best in terms of luxury. They are changed quite frequently—changes that are worth between £15,000 and £20,000. Someone could change caravans without there being a change in banding, but a house that had been improved could be moved into a different band when it was sold. Those anomalies will come to the surface. That is why we must obtain Ministers' views on those matters before they arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have constituents who owned a chalet on the coast as a holiday home. Under the standard charge, they were liable for two poll taxes for that chalet, which had few resources or services. Happily, that was accepted as an anomaly and changed. We are bordering on a similar state of affairs in respect of caravans. Some caravan parks are dealt with as business premises. That was one way to get round the poll tax. It will be interesting, where caravans and moorings are not classed as industrial premises and subject to the uniform business rate, to discover how the Government cope with the anomalies that will develop in the banding of caravans and houseboats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A decrease in value will lead to an immediate change, but an increase in value, unless the Secretary of State decrees otherwise, will be reflected only when a property changes hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From past experience, I suspect that the measure was framed so as to allow the Government to head
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0365">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>625</span>
off any criticism for taxing home improvements. Conservative Members would accept that. The Government believe that the installation of central heating or an extra bedroom should not be taken account of in valuation. That is the principle behind the banding system. However, there will be more anomalies under the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider two similar neighbouring properties in band B. Both have had alterations that have increased their value to over £52,000 each and that would take them into the next band if they were sold. Neighbours in semi-detached dwellings often draw up schemes together and make identical improvements. When the first property is sold, it will be revalued into band C. There would then be different council tax rates for identical properties. Conservative Members should try explaining that anomaly to the general public. The couple in the first house, with only the husband working, could pay band C council tax. In the other property, which is still in band A, there could be four adults, all working, who pay less tax than their neighbours. Try explaining that to the public! That anomaly will come about unless provision is made to head it off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Revaluations will take place only when the change in value shifts a property into another band. That gives rise to further anomalies, because a house owner in band B could spend £12,000 on improvements without seeing any increase in his council tax bill. Another house owner could spend only £1,000 on new windows or some such improvement but be liable to a higher band tax when the house is sold. The two houses are identical but if the first house is at the top of band B and the money spent on it takes it into band C, the valuer would put it into band C when it was sold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin M. Brandon-Bravo 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nottingham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman chapter and verse, but on numerous occasions the Secretary of State and Ministers have said on the Floor of the House that that sort of home improvement does not affect the valuation for local taxation purposes. Only major structural improvements would do so and might apply to his example of spending £12,000 on a house. No home improvement of £1,000 will make the slightest difference on resale from one band to another. That has been said on more than one occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are entering an interesting area. If the house owner spends £2,000 on the house, will that be disregarded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, if the person spends £3,000 on house improvements, will that be disregarded?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman can come up with the name of a builder who can build an additional room or a double garage alongside his house for the kind of money he is talking about I should be grateful for his name and address.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that massive structural alterations are involved—I am talking
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
about the value of the property. Do I take it that there are restrictions on what valuers can take into consideration when they revalue the property? If so, the details of what constitutes a revaluation should be spelt out. The Bill does not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 24(10) refers to "material increase", not structural increase, and to "material reduction".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Go on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to. Clause 24(10) says
	<br><blockquote><p>"'material increase', in relation to the value of a dwelling, means any increase which is caused (in whole or in part) by any building, engineering or other operation".</p></blockquote>
"Other operation" can mean an increase in value because it could be a change in the facade of the house or a small, inexpensive alteration in the roof. I understand the term "engineering" but I want qualification of the term "other operation".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To change an attic in a terraced house into a room with a dormer window could cost less than £1,000. That would constitute an alteration to the property, and it could affect the valuation because it may mean that there is an extra room in the property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We envisage such anomalies. Will the Minister verify the Government's policy on other operations that would increase the value of a property?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What prescribed conditions must be fulfilled for revaluation to take place under clause 24(4)(a)? Will there be a de minimus limit to the material increase or decrease of a property? I took the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) through a list as I thought that he might find it helpful. Will there be a cut-off point for revaluations that either reduce or increase the value of a property? For example, if a house is devalued, at what point will an alteration be made? If there is to be a cut-off level, will the Minister provide us with details of it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the arrangements for establishing, when it is sold, whether the value of a property has increased materially? Will the householder be under an obligation to inform the valuation officer? Valuations will be made and property will be placed in various bands without the householders being told the exact value. If the value of a property has reduced materially, will the onus be on the householder to apply for a reduction in his bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is natural that people living in their own homes are worried about such issues. Ministers have frequently said that the family home could be the biggest capital asset of a family. We are discussing local taxes that will be raised for community services through the family home. It is important that the Scottish Under-Secretary refers to such matters when he replies to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In moving the amendment, the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) went fairly wide of its provisions. It deals only with the removal of certain words that refer to a "relevant

	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
transaction", not a valuation. I shall allow the Minister to reply to the hon. Gentleman's points, but I shall bear them in mind when I consider how we are proceeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Allan Stewart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to be called to speak after the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) when we are discussing garages and caravans. I dealt with the clause on caravans and moorings earlier in our proceedings, although that applied solely to England and Wales. Presumably it is appropriate, therefore, that I should respond to the hon. Gentleman on his amendment that also applies only to England and Wales. I understand why there are no comparable Scottish amendments; the hon. Gentleman's concerns lies more with caravans and so on. His amendment would result in completely different taxation systems north and south of the border.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton asked about a material reduction in the value of a dwelling leading to a revaluation. Such a material reduction in the value of the dwelling could result from an increased flow of traffic past a house because of road alterations, or from the location of a petrochemical works.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Makerfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or an Opencast development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right—that is a further example. It will be open to the householder to apply for a revaluation, although in Scotland the assessor and in England the evaluer will be able to initiate an investigation of other dwellings if an individual applies. I understand that there is no difference of view between Conservative and Opposition members of the Committee about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the past, property valuers have used 2.5 to 5 per cent of the value of the property to decide the increase or decrease. Will a similar system be used in this case? We have been discussing how roads and highways may change the value of a property, and any such change would affect the value of a house, set out in the list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that the arrangements are equivalent to the old rating arrangements. I can also assure him that the "material increase" referred to in clause 24(10) relates to the value of a dwelling, whether or not planning permission has been granted. The fact that a house boat can be improved substantially without planning permission does not affect liability for a material increase under subsection (10).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Premises that are improved because of disability will be exempted. If a property is sold to someone with a disability will the exemption simply be transferred? What will happen if a disabled person sells a property to someone who is not disabled? Will a revaluation then take place because the new owner has no exemption?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The change for the disabled relates to what they pay, not to the original valuation of a property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to the banding arrangements. The Minister said clearly that the improvements would not adversely affect banding. We are all agreed that that is how it should be. However, if, at a later date, a property is sold to a non-disabled householder, will it be necessary to re-band the house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The key point is that the reduction applies to the disabled resident. So, on a sale to a disabled person, there would be no change in banding. The reduction is not on the valuation but is for the resident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general effect of the amendment would be to create a rolling revaluation. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has not tabled comparable amendments to enable that to apply in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is now such a Unionist that he would like Scottish law to be abolished altogether. Some of us think that there are differences between the way that things are done in England and the way that they are done in Scotland and that some of those differences should be maintained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have the hon. Gentleman's assurance that the prospect of rolling revaluations can be ruled out for Scotland. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have tabled an amendment that applies solely to England and Wales. That is yet another example of the differences in taxation policy between the Labour party north of the border and the Labour party south of the border. I do not want to raise the temperature of the debate, but I suspect that that is another example of the left hand not knowing what the other left hand is doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember coming here as a very young man and hearing the hon. Gentleman speak when my father was in the Chair. The hon. Gentleman made a very similar remark then and, I think that it was also in relation to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to know that my words of wisdom, even of so many years ago, have bound themselves indelibly on the memory of the hon. Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently moved, with my wife and family and mother-in-law, to a different house and improved it in several ways: I converted an outhouse, partly into a new bathroom, added a conservatory, put in a shower room and added two bedrooms to enable me to provide the appropriate accommodation and hospitality to any member of the Committee who might wish to visit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the system proposed in the amendment, an assessor would have had to come around at each stage to see whether my improvements would change
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>629</span>
the value of the house. I should have had an assessor coming round approximately every two months. That is what Oppositiion Members propose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be wrong—I hope that I am not—but I assume that the Minister acquired planning permission from the local authority to carry out all those improvements. If he did, the information was in the public domain anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see the point of the hon. Gentleman's question. Of course the information was in the public domain. Under the Opposition's system, an assessor would have to re-assess the property after any building work had been done. In other words, they propose a continuous rolling revaluation for England and Wales, but not for Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's account is interesting. Only yesterday, we were told that it was for the local authority to decide when premises were available for revaluing. The Minister spoke about the assessor having to visit every other month, but that is not the information that we were given yesterday. It is typical that a Minister says something one day, and the next day we find that the Government have changed their view. The Minister is nodding, so perhaps he will tell us why it is necessary for the valuation officer to go around every other day, week or month, when it is the local authority that decides whether there has been any material change in value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the local authority decides whether there has been any material change in value. I am referring to a series of changes that would represent a material increase in value. There would, therefore, be a rolling revaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not have told anyone about the improvement to my house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right—I know where his house is, or rather, I know the village.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minister is describing is not a change from what would have happened under the rating system. Under that system, the householder received a valuation notice every year, which he had to sign if the information in it was correct. If he had added several bedrooms to his house, he had to note the changes on the form. Back would come another notice telling him that the valuation of his house had been changed and that he would pay a higher rate. That happened under the old system, not under any new rolling revaluation system. As usual, the Minister has got it wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course I have not got it wrong. I am explaining the consequences of the amendment. It is interesting to have confirmation that the hon. Gentleman wants to go back to what happened under the rating system in England and Wales, but he does not want that in Scotland, as shown by the fact that there is no comparable Scottish amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked me what "other operation" meant, which is a legitimate question. That falls to be read in the context of building operation and engineering operation. The wording is taken from the definition of development in the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which defines development by reference to operators and material changes of use. The wording is thus based on existing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is interesting. The Bill refers to another act. That should have been stated in the Bill, so that one could check the meaning of terms. If terms such as "material increase" and "material reduction" in subsection (10) refer to other legislation, why is that not mentioned in the Bill? How are people to understand it, if even the Minister did not know until the information was passed to him? People outside the Committee will not know because the Bill does not explain. Does the Minister agree that the subsection is badly worded and should be changed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that the legislation referred to another Act; I said that it contained the same wording as another Act. The people who will have to make the decisions are the assessors or valuers, and they are familiar with the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I like to be helpful and I enjoy a little chat. If a fire extensively damages a property and substantial works have to be carried out to make it habitable again, will there be a requirement to notify the council of possible material differences?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England, the Department of the Environment has various schemes for making improvements on estates—estate action programmes and so on. If those programmes continue after the commencement of banding, will a review of the banding be implicit in those programmes either during or immediately after the improvements are completed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No; in those circumstances I assume that there would be a material increase, not a decrease, in the value of the property. There is no obligation on a householder to notify the council of a material increase in value. Information on that will come from the planning and building control applications. I emphasise that there is no obligation on a householder to notify a material increase, because it comes into effect only on sale, not before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right, except that in estate action programmes, the owner of the properties—the local authority—has a vested interest in respect of banding. If a local authority is using its housing improvement programme allocation to make substantial improvements on its estates or in a block of flats, would a rebanding take place? Would the tenants find their status changed as a consequence of the refurbishment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the Under-Secretary smiling at that, but if I believe what he told my local council when he visited my constituency recently, it seems that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
Government will increasingly provide estate action money to improve housing. Taking that at face value if substantial refurbishment takes place, surely the consequence will be increased value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the system proposed by the Labour party, properties would have to be revalued every year; I suspect that the people concerned would not welcome that. Under our system, properties would be revalued only in a general revaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or on the sale of properties—as I have already said. I think that it is fairly clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel sorry for the Under-Secretary. He told us about his redeveloped house, which is now in a higher value band. However, next year he may not have his ministerial salary— perhaps not even his salary as a Member of Parliament and he may have to sell the house. He will not have to pay the higher tax, but the next owner will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That did not add to the quality of the highly technical and professional discussion that I have had with the hon. Member for Makerfield. The hon. Member for Cathcart lowered the tone of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cathcart keeps trying to test me and put me off. The Under-Secretary went as far as he could in respect of local authorities, although I still have some doubts; but what about fire damaged property? [
	<i>Interruption.</i>] Why does not the Parliamentary Private Secretary sit beside the Under-Secretary? That would make it far easier. Each time I ask a question the hon. Gentleman nearly breaks his neck to get to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer with respect to fire damage is clear. If there is a material decrease in the value of a property, the householder can apply for a rebanding. If there is no change, nothing happens. If there is a material increase as a result of improvements made, nothing happens and nothing can happen until the property is sold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued by the line of questioning that my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) is putting to the Under-Secretary and by the hon. Gentleman's complete failure to answer the question. In fact, he ducked it. We understand that a material reduction will make a difference, but we wish to know whether a substantial element of fire damage qualifies as a material reduction in the value of the property. It appears not to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would depend on the extent of the damage. A chip pan fire that affected the wallpaper in the kitchen would not constitute a material change. If a householder believes there has been a material
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
decrease in the value of his property, he can approach the valuer or the assessor to see whether a revaluation is appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, but the situation is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that it is not. The relevant definition clause, which is clause 24(10) provides that a material reduction in the value of property can occur in one of three circumstances. One of those circumstances is
	<br><blockquote><p>"any adaptation of the dwelling to make it suitable for use by a physically disabled person".</p></blockquote>
That is not the case which we are discussing. The second circumstance is
	<br><blockquote><p>"any change in the physical state of the dwelling's locality".</p></blockquote>
Again, that would not apply. The third circumstance is
	<br><blockquote><p>"demolition of any part of the dwelling".</p></blockquote>
Does that circumstance apply in the case which we are describing, or does "demolition" imply a deliberate act by an owner or someone acting under the owner's instructions? That would be its normal meaning. Does "demolition" imply a degree of damage to the property and, in that case, does fire damage fall within that category?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a meal out of this. I shall read out the relevant passage:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'material reduction', in relation to the value of a dwelling means any reduction which is caused (in whole or in part) by the demolition of any part of the dwelling".</p></blockquote>
Fire damage that demolished part of a dwelling could entail a material reduction in the value. A chip pan fire that affected the wallpaper in a kitchen would not entail the demolition of any part of the dwelling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise not to intervene again, but I gather from what the Under-Secretary said that a fire that gutted the whole of the interior of a house and rendered it virtually valueless would not qualify as a material reduction in value. Is that the case? From what the hon. Gentleman has said so far, the answer is no.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. Presumably, the building would be rebuilt after the fire damage. The building would be exempt from tax during the rebuilding process. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would the building be exempt from tax? We have discussed extensively the regulations about residents in occupation. In this case, the building would be the person's address but he or she would not be able to live there. Would that involve a void clause or a downgrading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: By definition, the building would be uninhabitable and therefore not inhabited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am breaking my promise not to intervene further, but let us assume that there is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0369">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
substantial fire damage and that someone camps in the property because there is nowhere else to go. The Under-Secretary should concede that he does not know the answer to the question. He has given no evidence of having thought about it before, nor have the rest of the Government Front Benchers. The definition provided seems totally inadequate to cover the circumstances raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield. Why does the Under-Secretary not have the honesty to admit that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have explained the position clearly. I shall add to my comments by pointing to what we said in annex B of the consultation paper. Unoccupied properties which have the maximum standard multiplier of less than two have been described. Properties which, under the community charge system, had a multiplier of zero and would therefore be exempt under the council tax include property requiring or undergoing structural repair to make it habitable until six months after the repair work has been completed and property in the course of building or structural alteration until six months after the building or alteration is completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One or other of those categories would appear to apply to the situation that the hon. Member for Dagenham describes. They will therefore be exempt. However, I shall read in detail the points made by the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Makerfield. If they need any additional information, I shall ensure that they get it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>5.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that assurance. We genuinely look forward to hearing his further thoughts on the subject. What was said in the consultation paper was not relevant—nor would it be considered relevant by a court of law—to a proper interpretation of what is in the Bill. We are concerned not about habitability and occupational residence and liability to tax but about valuation and changes in valuation. It is worrying that a substantial reduction in valuation as a consequence of fire, flood or earthquake damage does not appear to be provided for in the Bill. We want that issue clarified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I have made the position clear, but I will guarantee to write to hon. Members if there is any additional information on this point that they should have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Ray Michie 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Argyll and Bute)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is another problem with dwelling houses that are incapable of being inhabited because they are undergoing repair, improvement or reconstruction which I raised earlier in our proceedings. Let us assume that a house is under repair and the tax is not required to be paid. If that repair has to stop for any reason, whether for six months or a year, will tax have to be paid until the repairs recommence? That was a genuine problem that we found with the poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can reassure the hon. Lady. The property would be exempt during the whole of the rebuilding process. One assumes that it
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
would not be anyone's sole or main residence during that period. The essential difference between the two sides of the Committee is that we believe that a property should move into a higher band only at the point where the owner has realised a capital gain as a result of the improvements he has made, whereas the Opposition does not. The amendments would bring about a continuing rolling revaluation which would involve a great deal of continuing administrative work. It would also create a wholly different set of circumstances north and south of the border. The hon. Member for Dagenham asked several detailed questions, as have other hon. Members, and I hope that some of those matters have been clarified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have dealt with the obligations to notify if there is a material increase, but the Under-Secretary has not touched on the obligations to notify authorities about a relevant transaction. It is clear that there is no obligation to notify if there is a material increase, so presumably there is no obligation to notify if there is a transaction either. Where do we stand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is right. There is no need for a purchaser to have such an obligation. In Scotland, the information about a sale would be held by the' Scottish Register of Sasines. In England and Wales, the particulars would be delivered by the stamp duty office to the district valuer, so there is no need for any such obligation on the purchaser.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Under-Secretary give way? [
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cathcart has just told me that I am correct, but I shall give way to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going to ask not whether the Under-Secretary was correct but about how stamp duty relates to a valuation. How is the circle closed? The question of where information on a relevant transaction comes from has suddenly shot into the debate. We are told that the district valuer is notified when stamp duty is paid on a sale. Where is the connecting piece of the jigsaw in the Bill to ensure that that is done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The stamp duty office is a source of information for the district valuer. The owner-occupier will continue to be liable for the council tax on the property until he informs the valuer that he has moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I said that the Under-Secretary was right, I meant that he is right in the sense that the sale transaction has to be recorded in the two ways that he described in Scotland and England. But the sales transaction does not show the material change to the property itself. If the Under-Secretary sells his house after the next election, the fact that he has sold it, the price that he got for it and the price for which he bought it will all be recorded in the register, but the fact that he has added to it considerably will not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assessor will have that information because all material changes are subject to building control and/or planning permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not necessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The material changes to which I am referring are all subject to building control regulations. I hope that I have clarified that point and that the hon. Member for Normanton is willing to withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This subject involves an important practical question which must arise thousands of times every month. We are genuinely inquiring to find the answer. The Under-Secretary seems to be saying that there is no obligation on the part of any liable person to notify the authority of a relevant transaction or of a material increase but that the relevant transaction will be notified automatically by virtue of the stamp duty being paid. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield has not received a proper answer to his question about how that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary went on to say that any evidence of a material increase will be held on file in some way because building regulation approval or planning permission will have been given. Are we to believe that all that will happen with no liability to offer information? Will it be pulled out by some wonderful computer programme every time stamp duty is paid on the sale of a property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that information from the stamp duty office was a source of information. I refer the hon. Gentleman to clause 27(6):
	<br><blockquote><p>"If in the course of the exercise of its functions any information comes to the notice of a charging or billing authority which it considers would assist a listing officer in carrying out any of his functions, it shall be the authority's duty to inform the listing officer."</p></blockquote>
That is why the other information available to the authorities is automatically given to the listing officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary said that, if he accepted the amendment, a rolling revaluation would be necessary, but we were told only this morning that the valuation office will notify changes to the local authority listing officer every four months. Such changes include demolition of property because of, for example, a motorway or sewage works. The valuation officer will constantly turn over information to the local authority. We are told that there will be a revaluation at least three times a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must differentiate between information that is passed to a listing officer and a revaluation as perceived by an owner or tenant of the property. Constant flows of information do not affect immediately the banding of individual properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a person sells his property and the new owner pays £20,000 more, that is a capital gain and notification must be passed on to the listing officer. Therefore, there is a rolling revaluation. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
Under-Secretary referred to revaluations occurring only in cases of capital gain. What would happen if a property was put in the list at 1 April 1991 at £40,000 or £45,000 and then was revalued and remortgaged for £60,000? How would that influence the revaluation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would make no difference. The property would remain in the same band.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, it is a question not of capital gain but of who owns the property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: A property can be banded upwards on sale, which is the point at which the owner realises the capital gain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore, there are ways of realising capital gain that could influence the value of the property. One can readily anticipate that people will question why their neighbours can make £20,000 on their property, yet pay the same amount in rates. That is another anomaly in the equation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point about reassessment of the band is that the person buying a house would know only about the current band and would have no way of knowing about a possible new band because that relevant information would reach the valuation officer, via the stamp duty officer, after the sale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is such an amalgamation of anomalies in the procedure that I ask the Under-Secretary to reconsider the issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) posed the question of a fire that gutted a house, rendering it uninhabitable. The Under-Secretary said that he thought that that would be taken out of the valuation list.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances, the position is absolutely clear because the house can be no one's sole or main residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is very interesting. We were told yesterday that, simply because a person leaves a property to go on a six-month holiday, that does not mean that it is not the person's sole or main residence. The consultation document, to which the Under-Secretary referred, mentions only structural repairs or building or structural alterations to make a property habitable. That is different from the description given by my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham. We are talking not about structural changes but about internal decorations, such as replacing a cooker and doing some plumbing. The Under-Secretary is saying that, in those circumstances, the property would be removed from the list. That constitutes a change to the description in the consultation document and adds a new dimension to the way in which properties can be taken out of the valuation list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other examples. If water penetrates a house as a result of flooding, the house will be in need of attention. Will it be taken out of the list?
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
Does that mean that people will not have to pay the tax, as the property will be classified as uninhabitable? People regularly suffer such problems. It is important that we know the Government's views on the circumstances that could alter the list. Instead of his reconsidering the provision, the Under-Secretary should agree that it is a cock-up. It should be considered completely afresh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If, like me, my hon. Friend feels nervous each time he hears Ministers airily dismissing practical problems, perhaps he would invite the Under-Secretary to add to the catalogue of inquiries that we hope he will make by asking him to answer the points put by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo). Let us consider a person who has lived in a house for 20 or 25 years, which he had substantially improved, and who then sold it to a delighted purchaser who had no idea of the history of the house. Are we to understand that the vendor has no obligation to do anything other than point to a low-banded valuation and say, "The council tax on this property is remarkably low"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Must the purchaser simply wait to be caught by the doctrine of caveat emptor, when 25 years of building regulations and planning permissions are pulled out of the computer and he discovers that the council tax bill suddenly doubles? Is that what the Under-Secretary meant when he described the relevant transactions and material increases in his curious and automatic manner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: People can be conned and misled on certain issues. If the Under-Secretary is arguing that that is not possible, perhaps he will explain why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The key point is whether a property has increased materially in value since it was last valued. The provision is not particularly new. Any sensible solicitor would immediately inquire whether the value of the property had been increased materially. He would inquire whether new bathrooms or new bedrooms had been added to it since the previous valuation. There will be no problem until we posit the circumstances in which a purchaser acts irresponsibly and against his own interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one final question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is on to a good point. In the past, when an estate agent advertised a house for sale, the advertisement normally included its rateable value. As a result of the Bill, estate agents will presumably mention the band into which the house falls. But let us suppose that the value of the property had materially increased. Until it was sold, it would remain in that band. Presumably, no vendor can be considered to have made false representations if he states that the property is in band C, even though he knows that when it is sold, the material changes will automatically put it at least one band higher—in the case of the Under-Secretary's home, two or three bands higher. The house remains in the band until the cheque is handed over when the ownership changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Under-Secretary wants to respond to the arguments put by hon. Members, I should prefer him to speak before I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. At present, the lawyer representing the buyer of a house inquires whether there have been any changes—whether anything has been subject to building control, for example—since the house last changed hands. That happens automatically now and will do so in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The value of the house, according to the Bill, is assessed in April 1991. If it changes hands, does the valuer take the value as it was assessed in April 1991? If alterations were carried out before April 1991—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh, wait a minute. If the alterations were made before April 1991 when the house was valued, but the price of the house has increased because of changes in the locality, will it go back to the April 1991 value when the new owner takes over or will the new value of the property be realised?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is that. I can see anomalies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Under-Secretary to reconsider subsection (10), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'material increase', in relation to the value of a dwelling, means any increase which is caused (in whole or in part) by any building, engineering or other operation, whether or not constituting development for which planning permission is required."</p></blockquote>
I accept that where planning permission is required it will be brought into the list, but the proposal states that it is not necessary for planning permission to be required. There could be a substantial capital increase in the property. How will that be brought into the system? We were told that the planning laws would apply, but they do not apply in every case. Will the hon. Gentleman consider that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. Gentleman a simple example: if a loft is converted into two bedrooms, unless it has new windows, planning permission is not required in certain circumstances. Building control permission, however, is required.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does that tie in with the formula to which I referred earlier? The value of a property may substantially increase, but it will not be revalued if it is sold because no one will know that its value has increased unless the local authority notifies the valuation officer. We were told yesterday that when an alteration—structural or otherwise—is made, the local authority, not the valuation officer, decides whether it is habitable. As no planning permission is needed, how will it be valued if no one is aware of the change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that there are material changes that do not require planning permission. The examples that I gave show that they require building
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
control permission, so the information that there has been a major alteration to the house will be known. It is correct that minor alterations to houses do not require building control permission. However, minor alterations are not material, so they would not change the banding of the house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of compulsory competitive tendering, building control is not always within the power of local authorities. It can be exercised by private operators and they are not obliged to reveal anything about it. The Bill is a hotch-potch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important matter because valuation is at the heart of the proposed council tax system. We have heard that changes will be influenced by planning permission and building regulations. I ask my hon. Friend to speculate on what would happen when someone has applied for and been granted planning permission but has not acted on it, and then sells the house with the planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I once purchased a house for which planning permission for an extension had been granted but the previous owner never got round to building it and neither did I before I resold it. However, the planning permission, which is at the centre of the information being used for valuation, had been granted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to move a stage further beyond the example that my hon. Friend gave. When a valuation officer considers the value of a property, he takes account of the area of land in which it is situated, and such factors as the construction of motorways, opencast mines and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the case of someone who has planning permission to build a house on land adjacent to his house. His house has a large garden and the value of his property takes into account the environmental aspects surrounding it. If there is sufficient land to accommodate the building of another dwelling, another £20,000 or £30,000 could be added to the value of the house. No action has been taken and there has been no structural change or addition to the dwelling but the granting of planning permission will have ensured a substantial capital increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has nothing to do with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, perhaps we could be told whether that aspect could be taken into account in listing and banding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould;</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> My hon. Friends the Members for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo) are developing an extremely interesting point which shows that the Government's proposals are as full of holes as a colander. From the Minister's sedentary reply, we gather that the mere granting of planning permission makes not the slightest difference to a material increase in the value of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
property. As we have been assured by the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), that a judgment will be made exclusively on the basis of that evidence—no doubt pulled out by a computer record—what on earth is the Minister talking about? How is a local authority or anyone else to judge, merely on the basis that planning permission has been granted, whether it makes a difference? It will either make a difference or it will not but there is no basis on which to make that judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The examples given show how that the proposals in the clause are hopelessly impractical. The Bill was hurried through and when we consider how our proceedings are unfolding, the Secretary of State's reluctance to serve on the Committee is understandable. He did not wish to be confronted by so many anomalies. First, there was the problem of garages, then that of prisoners. We are now considering the alteration of lists. The Secretary of State probably said "Send in the AA man". We need someone to repair the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->

My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) compared the abilities of Scottish and Welsh Office Ministers. Soon, he will be able to compare the abilities of the Welsh and Scottish rugby teams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment adds
	<br><blockquote><p>"physical state of the dwelling's locality"</p></blockquote>
to the criteria that can increase a dwelling's value. The amendment would tackle the anomaly in the way that properties are moved up or down into different bands. Local authority associations and the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy are interested in that. There is a difference between the so-called gentrification or yuppification of an area and the opposite trend—of course, we do not have yuppies in Wales. In England—certainly, in London—the general value of an area can increase or decrease dramatically compared with other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 24, the banding of a property can be increased because of building work—for example, the addition of an extension—but the change will result only if there is a relevant transaction, usually when the property is sold. A decrease in the banding of a property can be brought about by building work— demolition of part of the house, adaptations for the disabled—and any change in the physical state of the locality. However, decreases can be achieved at any time; no transaction is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals allow banding changes if property values are reduced—perhaps, because an abattoir and glueworks are constructed— but not if that abattoir were demolished and replaced with a park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, in the example used by my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney), the Government's proposals will allow revaluation in the event of long-term opencast mining, but not upon the cessation of such mining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government might ask about a widow who has lived in a modest home all her life and seen the area around her home change. As the amendment would still require a relevant transaction, the widow would be protected; the next owner would face a tax increase.

The amendment would undermine the principle of a banded valuation system. Such a system obviates the need for constant revaluations to take account of short-term changes in the property market.

It would not be fair to those who have lived in their home for a long time to have to pay more just because everyone in their area has benefited from an improvement in the locality.

	<br><blockquote><p>"or any facilities required to meet his needs which would have been taken into account under the provision of the Rating (Disabled Persons) Act 1978".</p></blockquote>
I hope that we might have a little more success on this amendment as the needs of the disabled are a matter of cross-party interest. Under the old rating system, the Rating (Disabled Persons) Act 1978 was generous to disabled people when the rates on their properties were calculated. The Bill would allow a reduction in the value of a property only where adaptations had been undertaken to make it suitable for a disabled person. That is much narrower than the 1978 Act, which took into account any facilities— garages, downstairs lavatories or central heating—if they were needed for disabled people whether or not they were specially installed or were specially adapted to their needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment broadens the definition so that facilities that would have been taken into account under the disabled rate relief scheme would qualify for a reduction under the council tax. Those of us who were in local government at the time would testify to the fact that disabled rate relief was relatively straightforward and simple. As many disabled people could not understand the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0374">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>643</span>
complications of the rating laws, it was a great advantage to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any amenity or facilities that increased the rateable value would be ignored if it were needed for the disabled person. Disabled people would always get some reduction in their rates bills if facilities that they needed affected the rateable value. Let us take, for example, a married couple who live in a two-bedroomed flat with central heating and a garage. The husband may have a back injury that leaves him bed-bound and in need of a separate bedroom. The rateable value of the flat would be reduced; it would be rated as a one-bedroomed flat because the second bedroom would be needed by the husband, and the central heating and the garage would also be ignored for the assessment. None of those facilities would have been specially installed, but they would become invisible for the purposes of assessing that hereditament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the council tax, it seems likely that few people will qualify for any such reduction in their bills. It would be unfair and lead to anomalies if the only facilities that qualified for the relief were those resulting from purely physical adaptations to the house. Disabled rate relief under the council tax would apply to a much smaller number of households than did the old disabled rate relief. It would also penalise those forced to move to more suitable accommodation compared with those who stayed put but were able to adapt their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not it is the Government's intention, these proposals, if unamended, will benefit owner-occupiers at the expense of tenants. Take the example of Mr. and Mrs. Jones who were living in a one-bedroomed flat when he had an accident. If they had been owner-occupiers they could have built an extension to the flat and the council tax bill would have been unaffected. As council tenants they would have had to apply for rehousing. Their one-bedroomed flat would have fallen within band A, but if they moved to a two-bedroomed flat with central heating that was worth, say, £55,000, they would move into band B and have a higher council tax bill. Under the existing proposals, they would not qualify for rate relief because their new home would be a standard two-bedroomed flat with no special adaptations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of a scheme based on bands rather than on individual rateable or taxable values makes the application of any procedure to the disabled much less straightforward than it was under the old rating system. A special alteration for disabled people would qualify as a material reduction under clause 24(4) as defined in clause 24(10) and could lead to a change in the valuation list of the dwelling. There can be no direct relationship between the value of the adaptations used by the disabled person and the size of the council tax bill because of the banding system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the tax payer to receive any reduction in his bill, the material reduction would have to be substantial enough to move the dwelling into the next band down. In many cases, that would be hard
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
to achieve, especially in properties that fall in the middle of a band. Consider a row of six semidetached houses, three of which have garages. Their values vary between £55,000 and £60,000 but they all fall into band C. Mr. Jones has had to build a garage and covered walkway to the house so that his disabled daughter can be safely transported to and from the car. Even if the value of those facilities were ignored, the value of the home would still be about £52,000. The Government have not been clear about how disabled relief will work under the council tax. The consultative paper merely states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"alterations should be disregarded in assessing the band into which the property should fall".</p></blockquote>
That takes no account of what used to be taken into account under the 1978 Act. The fairest and most administratively simple solution would be to guarantee that where any adaptation or facility counted as a material reduction, the dwelling would automatically be treated as falling within the next band down as long as the disabled person lived there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intentions are proper in that they want to do something for disabled people. However, the complications of the banding system mean that whatever they do will fall far short of the help for the disabled under the 1978 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not help noticing that the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) was reading from a piece of paper. I mean no disrespect, but it was either out of date or based on a misunderstanding. The press release earlier this week and the amendments already accepted have substantially changed matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's amendment is misplaced. The part of the Bill that he wishes to amend relates to adaptations that have been made to a person's house that reduce the house's value. There are two issues. First, we do not want to penalise disabled people for adaptations that they have made or for particular requirements that increase the value of their homes. Secondly, some alterations could reduce the value of their homes. That should not be ignored. The installation of ramps, grab rails or lifts, which are helpful to the disabled, could detract from a property's value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A separate question is whether a person who is disabled requires a more expensive sort of property than that which a person who was not so disabled would require. That covers features such as extra space or a downstairs bathroom. The amendment would bring into the "material reduction" section, which refers to alterations that detract from the value of the house and that we should not ignore, features from the old rating system that tended to increase the value of property and that we should disregard for the purpose of disabled people. Do I make my meaning clear to the Committee? The hon. Gentleman has put his amendment in the wrong place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear that we propose to take into account for valuation purposes alterations to a property that have the effect of reducing its value because they have been made specially for a disabled person and would not be attractive to another owner.

	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
Some disabled people need a property that would be more expensive than the equivalent property for an able-bodied person. We have announced a change of approach. Our new approach is this: we shall ensure that people with disabilities are treated fairly under the council tax, and 160,000 households will benefit from our decision that for certain disabled people—I will explain that in a moment—we shall automatically apply a council tax bill for one band lower than the band in which their property falls.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will apply to properties where there is a disabled resident who needs additional space for wheelchair circulation, or an extra bathroom or kitchen, or an extra room for special needs, such as for a dialysis machine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal will be simple to administer. If a disabled person is resident and can show that his or her special needs require one of the features to which I referred, the bill will automatically be reduced by one band. Our purpose is to ensure that disabled people should not have to pay more than they would pay if they did not have special needs and, therefore, did not have a special property requirement. In a band A property, by definition, they cannot be asked to pay more than they would otherwise pay. I do not believe that any reduction is required in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the needs of disabled people may be greater than the needs of able-bodied people. If they are on low income, the social security system provides help for disabled people up to a higher level of income than for able-bodied people, in recognition of their disability. That is absolutely right. In this Bill, I want to ensure that no one should be asked to pay more in council tax than he would if he were able bodied and if he did not have special needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend confirm that the special rating assessment for disabled people was an old ruling introduced before the new-style allowances for disability—for example, those recently announced concerning the rights of disabled people to work and special care assistance? I work a great deal with the disabled. Under the old rating system, the special allowance for disability was required to bear a social cost, which the social services now bear instead. Under the council tax, no special provisions are necessary, except to ensure, as my hon. Friend the Minister said, that no undue cost arises because of special adaptations. Provided that the social services play their part, all should be correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend speaks with great authority, but I want to ensure that the Committee understands that our proposals are vastly superior to the provisions of the rating system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Member for Torfaen talked about the simplicity of the old rating legislation, under that system, a tariff was applied to a series of possible adaptations to a house and the appropriate
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
reduction in the rateable value of the house was made. Under the council tax, once it has been established that a disabled applicant has a special need, for example, for additional space for wheelchair movement, for an extra bathroom or kitchen or an extra room, that person's tax bill will be reduced by one band, without the use of any tariff. That is easier to administer, potentially more generous, less intrusive for the disabled person and, to pick up a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson), more up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall anticipate a point that I think might be raised. I have not mentioned two items that were reflected in the old rating valuations: central heating for two or more rooms and an additional WC. I have not included them in the list of possible needs of a disabled person partly because it is extremely difficult now to distinguish a special need for central heating, as so many houses have it, but more particularly because the addition of an extra lavatory or central heating is not the sort of change that will be band-sensitive. That sort of change is unlikely to cause a disabled person to be allocated to a band higher than that to which an able-bodied person in that property would have been allocated. We have set up a generous and administratively simple system, which is not intrusive, which respects people's privacy and I commend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the enormous amount of help that we have received from organisations that represent disabled people. We always mention RADAR, but others have also worked in collaboration with us. As is apparent from what the hon. Member for Torfaen said, they were seeking a system whereby, without intrusion, disabled people would be allocated to a lower band. The Government have responded to that in the present proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made a very serious and significant point. He said that disabled people in band A will not receive any concession under the Government's scheme because those people will already be paying the minimum. That is partly because there are so many low-cost properties in that band. Where I live, low-cost properties, with values such as £15,000, £20,000 or £27,000, are mostly occupied by disabled people and they cannot expect to receive any concession. Under the former rating system and the fair rates system, those people, regardless of the value of their properties, would have received a concession. All disabled people would receive a concession if rates were the barometer used. Will not the Minister reconsider, because physically and mentally disabled people living in band A properties will not receive any concession under the Government's proposals? That is deplorable. Hundreds of people in the northern regions will suffer as a result of the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>; No. I strongly believe that disabled people on low incomes should be given help if they face expenses that are greater than those faced by able-bodied people. That is taken care of by the income support system and by the other benefits that are related to income. That will be true also of council tax benefit. Disabled people will receive help up to a higher level income than able-bodied people. In assessing income for the purposes of council tax benefit or any other income-related benefit, allowances such as attendance allowance and mobility allowance are disregarded because they are given for particular purposes and are not considered to be part of a disabled person's income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should give help to those disabled people who need it in recognition of their special needs, but when we are not dealing with disabled people on low income, we should do no more than establish whether, because of a person's disability, we are asking that person to pay more in tax than he or she would otherwise pay. In establishing that principle, we have gone a long way. We do not wish to make exact inquiries into the extent of change to that person's house, nor do we need to know whether there has been any change to the house. We need know only that a person requires additional space and may be living in a property that has been placed in a higher band than it would have been otherwise. Without further ado, that person will be given a council tax discount equivalent to one band. By definition, a person in a band A property cannot be asked to pay more in tax because of his or her disability, as such a person would already be paying the lowest level of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his keenness to help disabled people, the hon. Member for Normanton must not forget that his scheme would offer a disabled person who is not on low income an automatic discount in a band A property. In contrast, another person who is not disabled but whose income is much lower would not be given such a discount. If they were both on low income and qualified for benefit, the disabled person would get benefit at a higher level of income than the able-bodied person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

members of the Committee are here to do that job, although at times Labour Members are more assiduous in their duty than some Conservative Members. Our task is to press the Minister for elaboration on particular details. It was right and fair of my hon. Friend the Normanton to point out that an inevitable penalty of the Government's banding proposals, which are open to many objections, will be paid by disabled people. Those in the lowest band will not be able to get any additional benefit. That is exactly the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton. The Minister, on reflection, will see that that was a good point and that he was wrong to criticise my hon. Friend for raising it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not profess to be at all knowledgeable on these matters, so I wish to explore with the Minister a point that he made at the outset. He may be right about it. In order to establish that the amendment was incorrectly drawn, the Minister made a distinction between adaptions to a property that increased its value and adaptations that decreased its value. Does he mean that, under the scheme that he is putting forward, it need be established only that a disabled person lives in a property and that an adaptation has taken place, whether it decreases or increases the value? It that is not his point, is there still a distinction between the two categories of adaptation that he described when he began his remarks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to keep all those points in my head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman defended the hon. Member for Normanton. If the hon. Member for Normanton had made an inquiry about the detail of what I had said, I would not have reacted as I did. I shall have to read the record, but I believe that the hon. Gentleman used the words such as "disgraceful" or "deplorable", which was inappropriate in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was shaking my head a moment ago because the hon. Member for Dagenham asked whether it merely had to be established that there had been an adaptation. We have gone further that that. We are not necessarily talking about adaptations, although they may well have occurred. We intend to identify properties where there is a disabled resident who needs, for example, additional space for wheelchair circulation or an extra bathroom or kitchen, or an extra room for a special need, such as a dialysis machine. If a disabled person moved into a house that had not been adapted but had an extra bathroom or a larger drawing room in which to turn his wheelchair around, or a larger carport so that he could get in and out of his car, I do not want to know and the valuer will not want to know whether the property was specially adapted. We will want to know whether the disabled person had special needs which require extra room. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is beginning to grasp the breadth and the simplicity of the provision. We shall not ask to see by whom the property was adapted and when and how much it cost and whether it increased the value of the home. We simply want to establish that there is a resident disabled person who needs the extra space, and without further ado we shall bump down the tax bills by one band.

A disabled person might come forward saying that he does not need any extra space but that a lift has been put into his house that has destroyed part of the ground floor and one bedroom. If he ever comes to sell the house it will not be worth anything like the one next door. He would appeal against his valuation because an adaptation had been made to the house and caused a material reduction in the value. In that case the valuer would be interested and would make a valuation based on the house as he sees it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned a second category of change to the property; the lift that destroys part of the ground floor. I can see that that is provided for in the provisions about material reduction. However, how will such a change be detected, given the crudity of the valuation process? How will the disabled person know about it? All he knows is that someone, without ever knocking on his door, has passed along the street, seen a house that looks very much like all the others and has lumped it into the same category. The issue will not be about a material reduction because no change will have taken place since the time that the valuation was made.

People will be able to appeal against a valuation or, when the draft valuation list is published in December 1992, they could ask for their property to be valued taking into account the reduction in value after an adaptation.

Committee, who, unlike the occupants of the Opposition Front Bench can at least tell who is in the Chair at each sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Social services departments often have contact with disabled people and can be a valuable source of advice. I do not want my hon. Friend to become carried away on one issue. We are discussing material adaptations to a property that might reduce its value sufficiently to put it in a different band. It is likely that a lift, which blasts through a house from top to bottom, would be included in such a category. I do not want to lead her to believe that an electrically driven chair on a stairway, which could easily be disconnected and removed, would take a property from one band to a lower band. However, my hon. Friend made an extremely good general point that social services departments are well placed to offer advice to disabled people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Other adaptations would make a house less desirable to non-disabled prospective buyers, such as widening doorways to allow access for wheel chairs, which many people might feel would spoil the proportions of a room. A kitchen full of equipment designed for disabled people might not be attractive to an able-bodied person. Surely the simplest means of informing people of their rights to claim for different banding would be to include, in large letters, a notice in the bill telling them about their banding and whether they have been allocated a discount That would be a simple means of ensuring that the message got across.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. Local authorities will of course want to include such information, just as they will want to issue information about council tax benefit, transitional and other reliefs. There are factors which may reduce the attractiveness of a house to a potential buyer, but I would not want the hon. Lady to become too carried away. A widened door can probably be changed back to its original width at limited cost. It will not necessarily make a difference when it comes to being placed in one band or another. However, if a disabled person suspects that an adaptation to the house will reduce its value, he or she can seek a valuation based on the house as it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we are clear about the case of the extended space. The Minister's comments were welcome. However, RADAR and other organisations are genuinely concerned about lifts that reduce the value of a property. I am puzzled, and perhaps the Minister can help me. He is implying that once a valuation is made—the disabled person will not know in a sense that that has happened—an application can be made to change it on the grounds that a material reduction has occurred. I had assumed, perhaps wrongly, that a material reduction was something that would be made after the valuation date. Is the Minister not getting confused between an appeal and an application on the basis of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
a material reduction? Might a material reduction be something that a valuer had failed to take into account when he conducted the original valuation? Or is it not the case, as I had supposed, that a material reduction would occur subsequently and would be the basis for adjusting an accurate valuation in the light of subsequent circumstances?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the regulations that I made in August covered the point that adaptations made to a disabled person's property which reduced its value were to be taken into account in arriving at the valuation of the property in the first place. It is not a question of being interested in something that happens only after a particular date. We are saying that in trying to allocate properties to bands, the valuation officer shall take account of the fact that some properties will have been reduced in value by an adaptation that has been made for a disabled person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations that I made in August have been half superseded. They provided that if an adaptation had been made that increased the value of the property it should be ignored, while if an adaptation had been made that increased the value of the property it should be ignored, while if an adaptation had been made that decreased the property's value, it should be taken into account. The first part of that provision has been superseded by this easier system of finding out if there is a disabled person resident and whether he has special mobility for circulation, and so on. The part of the regulations that provides that a change to the property that reduces its value should be taken into account has not been superseded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that point and accept that in an ideal world an adaptation that reduced a property's value would be taken into account when the valuation was decided, but in the real world that may not be the position. I do not want to enter into a further area of controversy, but we argue that by virtue of the system of valuation that the Government have chosen, changes that are relatively undetectable—from an external inspection at least— might escape the valuers. Unless the disabled person is particularly acute in such matters, the valuation will be made without taking the adaptation into account. I suspect that this is a technical point, but what is the disabled person then to do? As I understood the Minister, he said that that would be taken account of by the provision on material reduction. I am not sure that that can be right. Surely the Minister must be saying that it would be the subject of an appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point about "material reduction" arose because the hon. Member for Torfaen wanted to amend that part of the Bill. In regulations that have already been made, I sought to guide the valuers initially so that they will take account of adaptations that tend to reduce the value of the property. If they are unaware of the changes, the person who lives in the house will make a proposal to the valuation office. Informally he may say, "You did not know
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
that I had a lift, so you should come to look at my house". Or he may make a formal proposal when he discovers from his bill that he is in band C but that the lift should have reduced thevalue of his property to band B. An appeal would then be heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much publicity will be given to the arrangements, not least by the excellent organisations that represent disabled people. The hon. Member for Dagenham will find that these important provisions, which will affect about 160,000 households, will be widely publicised in the press and newsletters circulated among disabled people. The rights are clear of a disabled person who is in a property that is larger than one that an able-bodied person would need or that has been adapted, and, therefore, reduced in value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to labour the point. I genuinely invite the Minister to give a simple answer because it may be my problem rather than his, but is he saying that provisions about material reduction are to do with grounds of appeal? I thought that material reduction was a separate provision about the alteration of the valuation list because of an event subsequent to the valuation. Is that not the case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised "material reduction" in clause 24(10) because the hon. Member for Torfaen based his amendment on it. That provision in the Bill takes account of a change—subsequent to the valuation process—that tends to reduce the value of the property. A council tax payer can then claim a material reduction in the value of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That subject is separate from the initial valuation, which is governed by regulations that we made in August. They provide that the valuation officer must take account of the property as it is including any unusual aspect of it necessary to the needs of a disabled person that may reduce its value. The hon. Gentleman made a valid point which I hope I have cleared up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That leaves us with the familiar, residual but very important concern that, because of the crudity of the initial valuation exercise, the adaptations will not be picked up by it. We retain that concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been constructive. I was not aware of the latest developments which the Minister outlined to the Committee. All Opposition Members welcome them. The organisations representing mentally and physically disabled people have worked very hard and the Government have done their best to take notice of them. The debate has highlighted the point made by my hon. Friends the Members for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) and for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) that the banding system is too insensitive. The Minister spoke of its sensitivity, but the system is insensitive compared with the old rating system when individual rating valuations could pinpoint need more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) made an important point about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
social services. We cannot undermine what county councils and other bodies do for disabled people. It was always a feature of our rating system and our local taxation system that they should somehow take account of disabled people's problems. We should remember that about 64 per cent of disabled people, or families with disabled members, have to move because of such problems. That makes it a problem of property taxation. The difficulty is that it is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
solely a property tax. If it were, it could deal with such difficulties much more effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, because of the developments mentioned by the Minister, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
