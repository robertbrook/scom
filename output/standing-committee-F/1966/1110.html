	<div class='title'>—(ADDITIONAL POWERS FOR NATIONAL COAL BOARD.)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. F. V. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 7, after '1934', to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(except as provided in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of this subsection)'.</p></blockquote>
I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we bracketed with this my following Amendment, to which the first Amendment is merely a paving Amendment, in page 1, line 27, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>Provided that the Minister shall not give his consent under section 9 of the Continental Shelf Act 1964 to the supply of such gas or petroleum for any of the purposes mentioned in subsection (4) of that section to any company in which the Board has a financial interest unless he is satisfied that the price to be paid is the best price obtainable in the open market and that other companies engaged in similar operations have been given an opportunity to tender for the supply of such gas.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this Amendment is fairly obvious. It is first of all to ensure that, whatever the National Coal Board's activities may be in searching for gas and producing it in a crude state, when it comes to sell it it does not use its powers to confer an unfair advantage on either itself or any of its subsidiaries. The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that during the debate on Second Reading we did quote a number of subsidiary companies either wholly or partly owned by the Coal Board which appeared to have in themselves far wider powers than the Coal Board itself was granted under the original Act of 1946.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems which arise here is in part the refusal of the Government even to attempt to justify their proposition that there will be no unfair competition as a result of this Bill. The Parliamentary Secretary on Second Reading accused us
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
of seeing lions under the bed but one has only to walk along this Corridor where in three successive Rooms one has the Steel Bill being discussed, a vast nationalisation Measure with ramifications far wider than the steel industry, in the next Room the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation Bill with the same sort of result, and here this Bill. This is only part, therefore, of a pattern although the Government have constantly dismissed criticisms that this inevitably introduces an element of unfair competition into any of the private enterprise industries in which these nationalised boards enter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has only to quote the very favourable position of the Coal Board in regard to its borrowing powers, one which, it is obvious, can be passed on to subsidiaries, and the Coal Board is in fact doing so. The Coal Board has been able to borrow and then to lend to these organisations at a higher rate. This is something which, at any rate in the present squeeze, is of enormous advantage. Many of these companies, particularly the smaller ones, would probably have great difficulty in raising capital at even very high rates, but the Coal Board is able to step in, borrowing at a favourable rate, and then lending to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the secondary problem here is the real interpretation of Section 9 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1964. This Bill starts off in Clause 1 with a proposition that anything in the Bill is subject to the Continental Shelf Act, and I put this matter to the Minister on Second Reading and I am bound to say that I did not think the answer I got was very satisfactory. What is clear, I think, is that under Section 9, if the Coal Board or any other undertaking produces gas for use as a fuel, it has to offer it first to the area Gas Board concerned and it is only after the area gas board has had the chance to take that supply at a reasonable price that the Minister is likely to give his consent under Section 9 to its supply outside the gas industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important aspects are in Section 9(3) and (4) which make it clear that totally different considerations arise where it is proposed to supply the gas for a purpose other than fuel. Subsection (3) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Minister of Power shall not give his consent under this section to the supply of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
gas at any premises unless satisfied (	<i>a</i>) that the supply is for industrial purposes and that the Area Board in whose area the premises are situated has been given an opportunity of purchasing the gas at a reasonable price".</p></blockquote>
This follows the lines of the Petroleum (Production) Act, 1934. Subsection (3) goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or (	<i>b</i>) that the supply is for such purposes as are mentioned in subsection (4) of this section "—</p></blockquote>
now these are the important words—"
	<br><blockquote><p>but shall give his consent under this section to the supply or use of any gas if satisfied that it is for the purposes mentioned in that subsection."</p></blockquote>
That is to say, in subsection (4), and when we turn to subsection (4) we read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The said purposes are industrial purposes which do not consist of or include the use of the gas as a fuel except in so far as the gas is used to provide heat or other energy required (	<i>a</i>) for a process in which the gas is used otherwise than as a fuel; or (	<i>b</i>) where such a process is one of a series, for any further process in the same series, not being a process in which a bulk product is converted into manufactured articles".</p></blockquote>
Now I must admit that the interpretation of that paragraph is not immediately obvious, but as I read the subsection as a whole it appears that if the Coal Board, for example, is intent on supplying this gas for a purely industrial, non-fuel purpose, for petroleum chemicals, although it may have to obtain the formal consent of the Minister, he has no discretion in the matter. The word "shall" is quite specific. In my view the Minister was quite wrong in his reply to me during the Second Reading debate when he said that this was something over which he had control and that he would not in fact give that consent. If I am right it fallows that should the Coal Board be disposed to supply its subsidiaries, Staveley Chemicals, for example, it is free to do this on terms much more favourable than the terms on which other chemical companies might be able to obtain a supply in the open market. The purpose of this Amendment is to prevent that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Parliamentary Secretary is replying to the principle—and I hope he will not tell us there are lions under the bed—I hope he will also refer to the important legal aspect, namely, what is the meaning of Section 9(3) and (4) of the Continental Shelf Act. It seems to
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
me that this opens wide the door to an extension of the Coal Board's powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second aspect which I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will dwell upon is the extent to which Section 1 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946, produces an extension of the powers under this Bill which are not apparent on the face of the Bill. Section 1 of that Act defines the powers of the National Coal Board and subsection (1) sets out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"There shall be a National Coal Board which shall, on and after the primary vesting date, be charged with the duties of"—</p></blockquote>
and these are set out and they are all duties, broadly speaking, connected with the getting and making available of coal—
	<br><blockquote><p>"working and getting the coal in Great Britain, to the exclusion (save as in this Act provided) of any other person".</p></blockquote>
This, of course, gives the Board a monopoly position. Then subsection (1,	<i>b</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Securing the efficient development of the coal mining industry; and (	<i>c</i>) making supplies of coal available, of such qualities and sizes, in such quantities and at such prices, as may seem to them best calculated to further the public interest in all respects".</p></blockquote>
Whether the Board is achieving that is a matter on which we are probably divided; and if it is not, whether it ought to come into these other spheres is a matter on which I think this side of the Committee would differ with the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important problem is to what extent the very wide subsidiary powers in Section 1(2) of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act extend the powers of the Coal Board in connection with any natural gas exploration or exploitation following from this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The functions of the National Coal Board … shall include the carrying on of all such activities as it may appear to the Board to be requisite, advantageous or convenient for them to carry on for or in connection with the discharge of their duties under the preceding subsection, and in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of this Section, (	<i>a</i>) searching and boring for coal in Great Britain".</p></blockquote>
Then there are (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>), but the important one is (	<i>d</i>) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"producing or manufacturing any goods or utilities which are of a kind required by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Board for or in connection with the working and getting of coal or any other of their activities, or which can advantageously be produced or manufactured by the Board by reason of their having materials or facilities for the production or manufacture thereof in connection with the working and getting of coal or any other of their activities, and supplying and selling goods or utilities so produced or manufactured".</p></blockquote>
When I first studied this matter it seemed to me that "or any other of their activities" must include, after this Bill gets the Royal Assent, activities connected with natural gas or petroleum, and if one looks back nearer the beginning of the subsection where it says
	<br><blockquote><p>"without prejudice to the generality of this section"</p></blockquote>
I think it gives a good deal more force to that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On second thoughts I confess I felt that probably the very opening words of the subsection which refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"such activities as it may appear to the Board to be requisite, advantageous or convenient for them to carry on for or in connection with the discharge of their duties"</p></blockquote>
under subsection (1), might confine that, but what I think is disturbing is that a number of leading industrial firms in the chemical industry tell me their legal advisers to take the view which I originally drew.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Government should tell us firmly what is the intention here, and come along on Report with Amendments to make that abundantly clear, and not leave the matter to vague assurances from Ministers which may or may not be based on a correct interpretation of the law as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Power (Dr. Jeremy Bray)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to deal briefly with this Amendment which, I take it, is moved to explore the position, rather than as an Amendment which would in effect carry out the purpose desired. I think the Amendment is defective in that it would not achieve the result desired, but I shall reply to its general intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Firstly, regarding the interpretation of the Continental Shelf Act for Staveley Chemicals in particular, which I gather is the case example that the Opposition are principally concerned about, the intention of the Bill is to put the Coal Board in exactly the same position as any other explorer in the North Sea. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
see no reason why it should be subject to undue further restrictions. The Bill as it stands does not give the Coal Board any privileges over those of other explorers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now there are a number of chemical companies which do explore in the North Sea at the moment and, indeed, some have found gas. They will be able to supply the gas they have found to their own operations inside this country, and the Minister will have to give his consent to do so. We believe that the Coal Board should be in just the same position, and the Bill as drafted secures this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment would put the Coal Board in a disadvantageous position, and this would not, I think, be the wish of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member raised the question of the duties of the Coal Board and how far its powers under the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946, would enable it to range far and wide in the exploitation of natural gas. That Act is drafted very tightly, so tightly that, to enable the Board to undertake North Sea exploration, we have had to introduce a special Bill. This Bill will give the Coal Board strictly defined powers to explore in the North Sea and to sell gas, but it will not alter the powers of the Board as defined under the nationalisation Act. In particular it will not alter the activities of the Board and the subsidiaries in which it would invest, other than those described by the Continental Shelf Act, 1964, which must relate to the main purposes as described in Section 1 of the 1946 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason, therefore, for the Opposition fear that the Coal Board, by this Bill, is to have a free licence to range over the whole range of petrochemicals, fertilizers, plastics and so on. Investment undertaken by Staveley Chemicals is related to the main activities of the Board. Further, Staveley Chemicals is not a subsidiary of the Coal Board as the Coal Board has only a 45 per cent. interest in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complex matter, and we have been so conscientious in our drafting that we have been caught out in limiting the powers and have had to table a technical Amendment. We have deliberately not made possible a wider diversification of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
the Coal Board's activities and therefore we cannot accept the restrictions which this Amendment would place on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has said that it is not possible for the Board to carry out exploitation and drilling except by the powers conferred by this Bill. Is it not a fact that the Board is already carrying out drilling on the Continental Shelf?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the drillings off Durham and further up the coast are for coal and this is permitted under the 1946 and 1949 Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The offers which have been made to the Coal Board by Allied Chemicals and Gulf Oil have not yet been accepted by the Coal Board and it is because these offers lapse at the end of this year that we are anxious to secure the passage of this Bill as quickly as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. A. P. Costain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Corfield) moved the Amendment I understood him to say that we did not want the Coal Board to have exceptional powers over private industry. The Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply, has put forward the argument that there should be equality between private enterprise and the Coal Board. I understand that that is what the Amendment is designed to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me most about this set-up, leaving out the principle with which we do not agree, is that we may have a nationalised industry producing a raw material which can be sold to other competing companies. I do not know whether it is in order to refer to the Companies Bill, but under that Bill a private company would have to disclose the area in which its profits were made. Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us whether similar powers apply to the Coal Board? Will the Board be obliged to point out in its accounts which of its operations work at a profit and which work at a loss? Otherwise, there could be a hidden subsidy. In fact, it seems that the Board is to have powers beyond those one would normally expect a private company to have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amused to see that the Bill enables the Board to search for and get. I wonder what happens if it does
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
not get. Would the whole operation then be illegal? It is this sort of wording which gives us concern. It always seems that with legislation on nationalised industries it is felt that these industries never make a mistake, and therefore the Government can put in words like this. In our experience nationalised industries generally do make mistakes. Our Amendment is to see that in this case if the Board makes a mistake it will be brought forward and there will not be a hidden subsidy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the reply and the approach of the Parliamentary Secretary wholly unsatisfactory. He started off by saying that the Government saw no reason why the Coal Board should not go into the Continental Shelf. Surely the duty of a Government who bring in a Bill like this is to tell us the reasons why the Board should. We have not had a single reason, except that it has had some offers from, or made some approaches to, the American companies, Gulf Oil and Allied Chemicals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He went on to say that it had no privileges over private enterprise. But of course it has, because the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any borrowings required by the National Coal Board in the exercise of these powers will be governed by the Coal Industry Act 1965 and may be borrowed from the Exchequer, subject to the overall limits on all the Board's borrowings in the 1965 Act not being exceeded. The limit on overall borrowings in the 1965 Act is £700 million which may be increased to £750 million by an Order made by the Minister and approved by the House of Commons. The exercise of the Board's new powers may accelerate progress towards their borrowing limit and cause an increase in the moneys issued out of the Consolidated Fund".</p></blockquote>
This is something which no private enterprise firm could conceivably have. It is nonsense to say that there is no advantage. It will be terribly unfair, having put the Coal Board into this business, if it has powers and advantages over private enterprise firms. It is not good enough to say that these things do not exist, and there is no case to be made in favour of the Coal Board not having these powers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary says that there are a number of chemical companies involved in this and that they will be able to supply gas for their own
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
operations. But they are chemical companies and they were set up as chemical companies. The Coal Board was not. It was set up specifically under the 1946 Act to nationalise coal with certain wider powers under Section 1(2). These entitle the Board to make things out of coal, but do not entitle it to go into the petrochemical industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Parliamentary Secretary says that there is no reason why the Board should not, why should it not go into the motor car industry? There is no evidence that it will have more expertise on the Continental Shelf than in making motor cars or anything else. The Government make unnecessary opposition for themselves by assuming this dogmatic attitude and when they do not come forward with a case for the legislation they are introducing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Costain) said, the Companies Bill was recently published. It contains stringent requirements for private enterprise. It is important that we should ensure that these are justified—and many of them I welcome—and ensure that they apply to nationalised industries. We should be very much happier if we could be assured not merely that the accounts of Staveley Chemicals will be published or referred to in the Coal Board accounts, or rather their overall results, but that we shall be told the specific profit and loss position of the activities of the Board in relation to natural gas exploration and exploitation, if it finds any, whether it goes to Staveley Chemicals or anywhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only on that basis that we can be sure that the results are not muddled up with subsidies, and judge whether the Coal Board is making a contribution to national resources in this sphere or whether it is merely doing so at such a high cost that it is wasting national resources which could be more profitably employed somewhere else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The least the Parliamentary Secretary should do is promise to come forward with Amendments to that effect, if he wants us to believe that he is genuine in his belief that it is not intended that there should be unfair competition. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will give us a better explanation, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
some undertaking to look at these matters and come forward with Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the defects of the drafting of the Amendment, and I do not profess to be a draftsman—heaven forbid: I would hate to produce some of the stuff they have produced—the plain fact is that this was a perfectly honest and straightforward attempt to see that anything the Coal Board gets as a result of the exercise of these powers shall be put on the open market and to place on the Board an obligation to get the best price available. In nearly all the Acts of Parliament with which I am more familiar, such as housing and land Acts, including those passed by the Labour Government in the 1945 Parliament, a local authority is required to get the best price available for its land, houses and so on. Even the Land Commission is required to do this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Member but the great bulk of his latter remarks have been more appropriate to the Question, That the Clause stand part of the Bill. In the hope that he was going to revert to proving the case for his Amendment I did not interrupt him, but I shall be glad if he will confine himself to that at the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was making is that this Amendment is designed to make the Coal Board obtain the best price available for anything it gets out of the North Sea by the exercise of these powers. This is not a probing Amendment. It concerns the difference between public and private obligations. This is something I had imagined was accepted by both sides. It is not unreasonable for the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the merits of the case, instead of dismissing it as a probing Amendment—or in order to keep us away from our coffee, although I am sure it was not that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to see that it looks as though we may be able to deal with the Bill as expeditiously as we had hoped and that not many hon. Members wish to press their inquiries about either the Amendment or the Second Reading issues which the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Corfield) raised. I deliberately did not go into the reasons for the National Coal Board
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0297">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
taking part in North Sea activities, because I did not wish to go outside the bounds of order by repeating the Second Reading debate. The reasons are quite clear. If it were in order, I would refer to the fact that in one of the consortia already operating in the North Sea we have the Union Rheinishe Braunkohlen Kraftstoff which—I trust my memory of German is sufficient to establish—is a German coal company. We have also a German electricity public utility exploring in our part of the North Sea. Are we, therefore, to accept a position in which foreign companies can undertake activities from which we prohibit the corresponding British organisations? I would have thought that the point had been sufficiently well taken by the House on Second Reading for no hon. Member to need to be persuaded of the merits of the principle of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Costain) asked about accounting and the possibilities of cross-subsidisation. With his great knowledge of industry, he will know that the international oil industry is an absolute warren of cross-subsidisation for all sorts of reasons relating to the tax provisions of different countries and the pressures brought by petroleum exporting companies and the national pressures in the markets themselves. Against this background, it is certainly the intention to pursue the most economic and profitable method of exploitation of any gas discovered by the Coal Board. We go further than this in that undoubtedly the principal activities of the Coal Board will be distinguished in the accounts, as they are already. I can certainly give the assurance that the costs in relation to North Sea exploration will be fully described in the accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South once again referred to the range of activities. I can only repeat that our intention is genuinely to secure that the Coal Board operates on the same basis as other explorers in the North Sea, particularly in relation to marketing. It may have escaped the hon. Member's attention that non-fuel uses for North Sea gas were deliberately covered by the Continental Shelf Act by hon. Members opposite when they were in Government and opposed by us, as a measure of
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
diversification in the markets in which the North Sea explorers would be able to operate and sell their gas. What he is now proposing is that that measure of diversification which his own Government provided for the exploring companies should be denied to another exploring body. It therefore seems to be both illogical and inconsistent with the course which hon. Members opposite themselves advocated, although with a good deal of misgiving from our side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore feel that the Amendment is inconsistent with their own previous policies towards North Sea exploration, and that if we were to pursue the subject of the merits of the Coal Board's participation in this work we would be in grave danger of straying outside the bounds of order. I therefore feel that there are no further questions of substance relating to the Amendment to which I should reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Blaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his opening remarks the Parliamentary Secretary made a big point of the claim that the object of the Bill was to put the National Coal Board on the basis of equality with firms in the private sector. Does this mean that somehow the Government are to introduce legislation giving companies in the private sector equally favourable borrowing terms as are described in the Bill? We have not heard about it if that is so. Does it mean that, in future, if firms in the private sector make losses, periodically they will be written off by the Government and borne by the taxpayer? If either of those two things is true, I shall be very surprised. This talk about putting the Coal Board on a basis of equality with private companies is so much nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Ogden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend consider not only equality between the Coal Board and the Gas Council on the one hand and private firms on the other, but also as among the 23 or 25 firms already operating in the North Sea? Do they all borrow their money on the same market? Do they all have the same resources? Is it not the basis of the argument for private enterprise that there should be differences? Are not hon. Members opposite suggesting that everyone on the private side is equal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Who said that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we are labouring this issue a little. Hon. Members opposite themselves granted licences to the Gas Council and its partners to explore in the North Sea. That is a public enterprise borrowing capital on broadly the same terms as the Coal Board. By their own actions when in Government, they accepted that it is legitimate for public enterprise and public money to be used in North Sea exploration. Furthermore, the German public utilities are exploring in the North Sea on the kind of terms on which German companies are able to raise capital. Are we to say that what hon. Members opposite themselves permitted the Gas Council, and the terms on which other overseas companies are operating should be denied to the Coal Board? I do not think that that proposition would bear examination.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is something in what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, but we should stop talking about allowing the nationalised industries to operate on the same terms as private enterprise. They do not do so. There may be reasons why they should not, but the fact remains that they do not. No private enterprise company can raise money in the same circumstances as a nationalised industry can in this country today. Nor is there any private enterprise which can have its losses written off at the cost of the taxpayer. It is therefore nonsense to say that nationalised industries do not have a considerable advantage over private enterprise. As long as that is quite clear and everybody understands it. I am satisfied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to labour the point, but there are all sorts of ways in which the nationalised industries are at a disadvantage compared with private enterprise. An example is in the payment of investment grants, which the nationalised industries do not receive in respect of their main activities. To say that the nationalised industries are at an advantage in competition in common activities with private enterprise is to go beyond the acknowledged facts. For example, the Confederation of British Industry has set out terms of competition between public and private enterprise which are broadly acceptable to the Government but which ignore the standard of disclosure in the nationalised industries as compared with that of private com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
panies, and which ignore the standards of disclosure even as they will be set out in the new Companies Bill. Certainly there has been an advance towards the standards already achieved in public enterprise. However, if we pursue this matter, we shall stray beyond the bounds of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was perfectly prepared for this debate to be closed about ten minutes ago, but when the Parliamentary Secretary says that we are inconsistent, I can only assume that either he has not listened to the argument, or not bothered to refer even to the statutory provisions which I quoted this morning. If he looks at the Continental Shelf Act, a structure built upon the Petroleum Act, 1934, he will see that it is quite clear that the Petroleum Act in effect says that the Minister shall grant licences to such persons as he thinks fit. There is no case at all to be made for the argument that because the Minister has granted licences to foreign enterprises the only way in which British enterprise can be brought in is to shovel a lot of public money into and extend the powers of a nationalised industry. That is a wholly bogus argument and shows that either the Minister has not read the Acts to which the Bill refers, or, for some reason, is not prepared to use his powers if he thinks that in the national interest it is a good idea to keep out foreigners. The idea that foreigners can be be kept out by subsidising the Coal Board is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing inconsistent between Section 9 of the Continental Shelf Act, which makes it quite clear that outside fuel firms can exploit on their own, including the Gas Council, and what we now say. We have never suggested that the Gas Council should be in a different position. What we have said is that there is no case for bringing in the Coal Board. If there is any inconsistency it lies with the Labour Party which in 1946 set up the Coal Board to look after coal and not oil.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Members opposite produce arguments of that sort we shall not finish the Bill in the two days which we have tentatively agreed. That argument is absolutely bogus and a red herring, and the hon. Gentleman has not addressed himself to the problem of fair competition. He spoke about investment allowances, but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0299">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
forgot that none of these nationalised industries has ever contributed to the Exchequer by taxation. The Coal Board does not look like ever paying it, whether it finds gas or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport (Mr. John Morris)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 2, line 13, to leave out from 'persons' to the end of line 16 and to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'anything provided for the purpose of the exercise by the Board of their powers under the said paragraphs (a) and (b) so far as not for the time being required for use by the Board for that purpose'.</p></blockquote>
I regret having to trouble the Committee with this small and almost technical Amendment. Subsection (1,	<i>e</i>) makes available to others, for example by hiring out, any facilities provided for the purposes mentioned in subsection (1,	<i>b</i>). All the Amendment seeks to do is to extend that to anything provided under subsection (1,	<i>a</i>). The object is to ensure an economic return on facilities not fully used. I am sure that the Committee will agree with me about the Amendment, which may in turn marginally reduce costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the hon. Gentleman, he is saying that the Amendment extends powers to those things mentioned in subsection (1,	<i>a</i>) as well as those in subsection (1,	<i>b</i>).

have completed your sentence, Mr. Rogers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members were rather late in waking up, but in the circumstances I will go back to the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Lancaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged for the opportunity to speak on the Question, That the Clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill. I am afraid that it will take some little while to satisfy ourselves about the Clause, but the advantage of the Committee stage of a Bill such as this is that it enables us to take up points raised on Second Reading, to deal with replies from the Minister, and indeed to reply to interjections by other hon. Members, and this is what I should like to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am going to deal in part with technological matters, and I would not wish to claim that I speak with anything other than some experience. Many people outside the House could speak much more emphatically, and with much more knowledge, on the matters about which I wish to speak, but, as this is in considerable part a technological Bill, I must make certain references in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also declare that I have an interest in matters of this sort, although nothing that may emerge from the Bill could possibly affect my personal interests in any way. My interests are that I have for many years belonged to a firm which carries out research and exploration. Indeed, we do about three-quarters of the National Coal Board's requirements in that regard. We do almost the whole of its geological survey requirements. We act as consultants to other of the nationalised industries, and we do our work in the happiest relationship with the Board. We carry out research on land, and we have carried out research in the North Sea during the last nine years, and three years previously in the Forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do this because the Board has long since come to the conclusion that this is very specialised work. The Board does not feel that it wishes to do this work itself, or possibly that it is not competent to do itself. The Board knows what we are doing, and it can play a full part as a partner in this. I would not for a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
moment wish to deny that. The relationship is a very happy one, but there is the distinction that the Board does not carry out the work itself, and quite possibly it would be prepared to acknowledge that it was not competent to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that regard there was an interjection during the Second Reading debate by the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock), who, unfortunately, is not here today. He said that it was all nonsense to talk along these lines, because the oil companies did not necessarily do their own research, they engaged contractors to do it for them. But that is a completely false analogy. Oil companies do a great mass of their own research, and it suits their purpose to engage contractors to do other parts of it, in the same way as it suits their purpose to do some of their tankerage, and to engage chartering concerns to do another part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About three years ago I was in the oilfields in Libya. B.P. had two boring teams on the ground. The third boring team was a French one. I knew about it. It had been contracted by B.P. to do the work for it. The point is that B.P. knew precisely what the French team was doing, it laid out the work, and it was familiar with all the techniques involved. The relationship between B.P. and that boring team was different from the relationship between my concern and the National Coal Board. Only a fortnight ago I took a plane to Das Island in the Arabian Gulf to see two boring processes going on there, one being undertaken by the oil company operating in Das, the other being an American charter concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Neal</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. This is all very interesting, but may we be told what relevance it has to the Clause under discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Lancaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was attempting to do that. My opposition to the Clause is that the Board will engage in an activity which I claim it is not competent to do, and I have made these analogies because during the Second Reading debate an hon. Member said that this was a perfectly normal thing to do because this was precisely what oil companies did. I was attempting to show the very real difference between what that hon. Member sought to say was the position, and what is in fact happening. My claim
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
is that the Board will engage in something which, I believe in all honesty, it would say it was not competent to do itself. The reason why I think that it is unwise for the Board to undertake this work is that, as I said on Second Reading, it means in effect that the Board will be a sleeping partner in an activity for which it has not the real energy and expertise to take a full part in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Second Reading debate I was interrupted by an hon. Member who asked why, if this was a chancy affair, and there was an element of speculation in it, the oil companies would become interested in the Continental Shelf. The answer to that is that the oil companies are able to take a calculated risk, and a calculated risk means exactly what those words say. The oil companies are able to calculate the risk. They have the experience and the expertise to be able, within certain limits, to calculate the risks involved. They could not calculate the risk unless they had both the experience and the expertise. The National Coal Board will go into exploration, or partly into exploration, in the North Sea without the knowledge to enable it to make the calculation which would make it a calculated risk. The Board will not only be a sleeping partner, but will be a partner in something of which it cannot calculate the limits involved. I do not believe that this is in the interests of the Board itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never been pessimistic about the future of the coal industry. I believe that if it puts its house in order, both from the point of view of organisation and of administration, it has an opportunity second to none to go ahead and do the things which it was set up to do, namely, to produce coal at the right price, and in the right quantities. It has at this moment a level of management possibly higher than we have had for a generation. It has ample resources, and if it sets its house in order it can produce results which will astonish people, but it will not do that if it has to look over its shoulder and think that this may be one solution to its problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was suggested during the Second Reading debate, I think by the Minister, that this would raise morale within the coal industry. Why on earth should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
the individual collier, looking at the thing dispassionately, say, "The Coal Board has taken a chance"—as it might have done and gone down to Epsom and backed a horse—"and it has come off." It has come off not because of the Board's knowledge and expertise, but because it has taken public money and put it into another firm. That firm has done the work and brought it off. Hooray for the National Coal Board. I shall be a happier collier"? I do not think that the individual collier will look at it from that point of view, because it will be pure speculation. It is speculation, for the reasons which I have stated, that the Board is taking on something in which I am sure it does not claim to be expert. The Board is going to depth about which it has no knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I might again refer to my interest in this matter, I belong to a firm which not only does a great deal of work in this country, but is almost foremost in the international world. We do exploration and research down to about 12,000 ft. We explore for all sorts of minerals in different parts of the world, but we would not claim to be experts in regard to oil. Oil is a very different matter, and if we, one of the foremost firms in the international world in research, cannot claim to know anything except in a general sense about oil exploration, to that degree the Coal Board could claim to know even less. That reinforces my argument that in doing this the Board could be doing nothing more than speculating with public money. I do not believe that hon. Gentlemen opposite would consider that to be wholly in the interests of the Board or of the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have taken some time talking about these things from a technical point of view, but it is only eighteen months since we had another technical Bill. That was to do with gas storage. On that occasion I opposed the matter, but the Bill became an Act of Parliament. Unfortunately, people had second thoughts subsequently, and the very conditions which I then suggested were the ultimate conditions for the storage of gas, and in fact are the conditions under which a large development in gas storage has taken place by the Gas Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth while thinking of the technical aspects of the matter. I am afraid
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
that during the Second Reading debate this issue was rather lightly passed over. It was, perhaps, rather inevitable that it should be, because it is difficult to argue technicalities during a Second Reading debate. I bring these things forward now because I am genuinely, and I think I have proved myself, and have been for a long time, a friend of the coal industry. All my original interests were, and my continuing interests are, with the coal industry. I want it to make a success of all that it is capable of making a success of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know only too well that it has failed in so many endeavours which have not been precisely analogous to its real purposes, and that it has not had a very wide experience in geology itself. Perhaps I might give three examples which the Parliamentary Secretary may care to check. I am thinking of Rothes, Cotgrave, and indeed Bevercotes. If the hon. Gentleman knew the real story of Bevercotes——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alex Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I hear the hon. and gallant Gentleman refer to Rothes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Lancaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that the Rothes project was the brain child of private enterprise, the Fife Coke Company?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Lancaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but the error arose because, having taken the original research by the private enterprise company, there was no research into water measures. That is where the thing failed. They went ahead on the original geological research without carrying out research into water measures, and that is why it failed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eadie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a miner with thirty years' experience, and I live in that area. I must say that what the hon. and gallant Gentleman is saying does not stand up to examination. The project was the brain child of the Fife Coke Company, which devised the plan. The Coal Board came in and carried on where that company left off. It carried out a geological survey and everything else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I cannot allow hon. Members to go into these examples in great detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Lancaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I freely acknowledge that it was on the research carried out by private enterprise. I gave the reason why it failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely mention those examples of the fact that the Board's experience in geological research has possibly not been the happiest one. It is capable of doing lots of things very well, and I am by no means pessimistic about its future, but I do not want it to be looking over its shoulder at things with which it is not familiar and with which it would not claim to be familiar. Merely to say that it wants to take part in something which may turn out a success and may incidentally raise the morale of workers in the industry is a false approach. If it succeeds, that will be because a speculation has come off, and not because it brought about success in the North Sea by its expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile it asks for public moneys. It may be suggested that this is not on a very large scale, but it will be taking part in a speculation and not in a calculated risk, and as a sleeping partner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Bill will become an Act, but I do not think that it is in the Board's interest and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will discuss this at some length with the Minister and put before him the possibility that this is not altogether the wisest thing that the Board has attempted to do. Diversification can be a good thing, and we do not want to deny it, but here it takes the form of pure speculation. It is not in the Board's interests, and I and my hon. Friends will do our best to oppose the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Costain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Replying to something I said in the previous debate, the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that we on this side of the Committee arranged that the Gas Council should have facilities for drilling for oil in the North Sea. I was not sure whether he was surprised at that and what argument he would deduce from it, but where we accept that there must be a nationalised industry carrying out a function we are not doctrinaire opponents of nationalised industries. However, we believe that everybody should be allowed to work according to his last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had thirty years' experience working closely as contractor with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
National Coal Board and British Petroleum Company. Bearing in mind that the Government have a majority interest in the British Petroleum Company and that it is one of the greatest authorities in the world—it has forgotten more about wildcatting for oil than the National Coal Board is ever likely to know—why do the Government, because they happen to feel special favouritism towards the Coal Board, feel that they must give it additional powers? Why do they not give additional powers to the White Fish Authority? Oil derives from fish, and at least it knows something about going to sea. Why do they not give additional powers to British Rail, because it consumes oil, which is likely to be produced?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing was said in the Second Reading debate, and the Parliamentary Secretary has not yet said anything here, to justify the Clause. I appreciate, Mr. Rogers, that you have not allowed a debate on this but I remind you that in moving the first Amendment I indicated that I had a number of points to make on this issue. The whole tone of the Clause and its background indicate to those who have had many years' practical experience how the whole thing has been taken much too easily. It seems to be thought that all that is needed is an Act of Parliament, the taxpayers' money and then to go around wildcatting, and that if one is wrong it is too bad but if one is right it will give a fillip to the Coal Board's profits. The Government, who claim to be far-seeing and dynamic, should appreciate that the right way to get things done is to arrange that the experts who have the practical experience get on with it. The Parliamentary Secretary has claimed many times to be an expert on scientific research. Does he believe that the Coal Board personnel have this experience?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in no way belittling the experience of personnel of the Board, which has some of the greatest technicians in their own field in the world. When my own group was carrying out coal operations in Africa and other continents I often boasted to our foreign clients how efficient the Coal Board is. Nobody in the Committee can claim that I have a prejudice against the Board. It is a splendid organisation when doing the job it has the experience to do. But here
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
we have a Socialist Government determined that they shall do something special for their pals—and the Coal Board for some reason or other is one of their favourite children, possibly because a number of hon. Members in that party have come up through the mines, and they must be proud of that. There is nothing wrong in that. But why bring this sort of thing into commercial enterprise? Why expect the taxpayer to make contributions just to fill in this particular section of industry? That is my basic objection to the Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was no case in the Second Reading debate, and the Parliamentary Secretary has not yet made it here, that the Coal Board has some special experience, special technical ability, special technical expertise, which would qualify it to go drilling in the North Sea or the Continental Shelf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement that they shall "bore for and get" seems stupid to anybody who has spent his life drilling for oil. Is it so certain that all it has to do is to have an Act of Parliament passed, find a place for a hole, drill it, and oil will come gushing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that if one bores long enough one is bound to get gas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Costain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not pretend to be an expert on how long one must bore. I have some experience that a lot of gas makes a lot of bores. I do not know whether that is what my hon. Friend refers to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is just a little bit of Irish, meaning, "Let us get some additional powers". Can it possibly build up the morale of miners to know that one section of the National Coal Board is going into other operations? Some of them are naturally worried that oil and gas will take some of their revenue. Will they be reassured to know that the Board is now deciding to get on this bandwagon? Will it encourage a miner to feel that it will still go on coal mining if it finds that gas is more economical? There is nothing in the Bill and in the Clause that is likely to lift the morale of a miner. I hope that those on the other side of the Committee with more experience than I will make some reference to that. Does any hon. Member opposite say, "I have been a miner all
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
my life and I am thrilled to bits to think that the Coal Board is now going to drill for oil. That will make my job more secure"? Would that lift morale? I should have thought that the opposite would be the case. The very fact that hon. Members opposite do not rise encourages me to think that my argument is logical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we should not accept the Clause and why we should not allow the Board to enter areas in which it is not technically experienced. Let it get on with the jolly good job it is doing. Let British Petroleum, of which the Government are the largest shareholder and! which is expert, get on with the job. Why take up the time of the House to give additional powers which we think are quite unnecessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am by no means an expert on fuel policy. It is not unknown that Members of Committees considering technical Bills are not all experts. Most of the Committees on which I have ever served consisted of more non-experts than experts. I look on this matter from the point of view of an industrialist and one who is concerned with seeing that the nation's resources are exploited to the maximum efficiency and benefit of the nation as a whole. I therefore find it hard to understand why the Government want to give these additional powers to the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is understandable that the Gas Council should have had the powers, either by itself or in co-operation with others, to search for sources of natural gas. It understands the problem of distributing and processing gas and the problems of users of gas of different kinds. The same thing does not apply to the Coal Board. I suspect that perhaps the real reason why these powers are now being sought is that the Board is desperately looking for some profitable enterprise to make up for the losses it incurs year by year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the development of natural gas and the increase in the activities of the Gas Council, which has been a very successful nationalised enterprise, will have a long-term effect on the Coal Board, because presumably it will lessen very considerably the demand for coal over the years to come. It was suggested by the Minister in the Second Reading debate—I speak from memory—that by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
1970 the amount of natural gas available would be equivalent to all the town gas now used which, in terms of coal, is about 13 million tons of coal per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the Board must look upon the searches and developments on the Continental Shelf with a great deal of anxiety. I can understand its anxiety to get into what it thinks will be a profitable development to offset the loss of revenue which will follow the fall in coal consumption. My concern is whether it is right to do it. Lord Robens whom my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Corfield) quoted in the Second Reading debate has said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The whole object of our diversification is to defend this vast investment back at the pits."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st November, 1966; Vol. 735, c. 282.]</p></blockquote>
I can understand his wanting to do this, but it was not the purpose for which the Coal Board was established. It was established, as has been explained very fully by my hon. Friends, to exploit, develop and sell coal, and for no other purpose. If it is to diversify and go into other enterprises to protect the original investment, one could suggest many other enterprises that it could enter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One does not know where this will stop. Before the coal industry was nationalised some of the coal owners had a number of very interesting diversifications. One well-known coal owner in South Wales, for example, owned a brewery. This was very profitable. When he found the takings in his pubs were falling he would arrange for the managers in his pits to ensure that the men left half an hour earlier and so got into the pubs half an hour earlier, and this put up his brewery profits. That is something I suggest to the Coal Board when it looks for profitable diversification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads me to a serious point, however. If a policy of diversification is to be followed by a nationalised industry there is no reason why it should stop anywhere. Why not go into a wide variety of interests with no immediate reference to the main activity for which it was established?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The diversification in the Bill has no real reference to the main activity for which the Board was established. I therefore find it hard to understand why these powers are sought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
The Electricity Council has been showing considerable concern at the advantage which it thinks is being gained by the Gas Council in its discoveries of natural gas. It was suggested not long ago that it should seek an additional subsidy or should be able to get supplies of fuel at special reduced prices to enable it to compete with the Gas Council. Why should not the Electricity Council be given the powers to go into the Continental Shelf and start to exploit and develop the resources there? Why should not it be able, perhaps, to get some profits out of something which it is thought might be a profitable enterprise in order to offset any fall in revenue it may suffer because of increasing competition from gas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Costain) was saying, there are a number of nationalised enterprises which might be given the same powers. It is inconceivable to the ordinary layman looking at this from a common sense point of view that the Gas Council should be singled out to be given these privileges when already another nationalised industry has got the power to take part in this development quite properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it very hard to support the purpose behind this Bill. I know we are, if I may use a vulgarism, in a sense spitting against the wind, because no matter what we say in this Committee the Bill will go through.

the wrath of the Whips who want to get Government legislation through as soon as possible. Of course, that is true whichever party forms the foot. However, one of the unfortunate features of the Parliamentary system as it now operates is that it does not matter how good the arguments opposed to the Government's case are, they will take no notice of them. They will use their steamroller majority to steamroller the Bill through even if it is against the public interest. In the course of the last two years many more measures have been steamrolled through Parliament than ever were during the whole 13 years when we were in power.

I find it very hard to believe that this Clause and this Bill are necessary. I think the Bill has been introduced only to enable the Coal Board to make good its losses in such a way as to disguise some of the cost to the nation of the subsidy on coal development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know about boring, but if one gases long enough one is bound to bore.

We were glad to hear the hon. and gallant Member pay tribute to the quality of its present management, and certainly to the quality of its miners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think most of the points the hon. Member made, and which other Members have made, were in fact also made in the Second Reading debate, and, indeed, were replied to then. On the particular point that he made about the geological research interests I did check this with one or two petroleum geologists who are very active in the North Sea. The position is in fact that some of these geological research firms are the effective
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
brains behind the vast international oil companies which are operating there. I would ask the Committee not to be bamboozled by names. Any particular operation is carried out by two or three chaps whether it be Gulf, the Coal Board, Shell or any other company. There is not the least doubt that the Coal Board, in consultation with its American partners, will have access to as good brains as any in this field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of why introduce a second—indeed, a third, because the Gas Council and B.P. are both bodies in which the public interest is predominant—why introduce a third company into North Sea exploration, it is because there are different aspects of the art of petroleum exploration, and different fads and fashions sometimes produce different results, some more successful than others. If one is in partnership with one oil company, as the Gas Council is, these partners would be a little reluctant to continue as intimate a partnership with a body which was in partnership with another oil company which was its competitor in other respects. There is a genuine commercial case for introducing a third company into North Sea exploration.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Costain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Parliamentary Secretary please deal with the point I made about boring for and getting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member. The Clause reads that the Board shall
	<br><blockquote><p>"have power to search and bore for and get."</p></blockquote>
The fact that one has power to do something does not mean that one does it, nor does the fact that one tries to do it mean that one necessarily succeeds. It is wholly possible that the Board would search and bore and not get. This is by no means a problem in the Bill as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had been hoping that the Parliamentary Secretary would have dealt with a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Costain) about the effect on the morale of those engaged in the coal industry of the extension of its powers to cover the getting of oil and gas. I should have thought that extension might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
be good for the morale of Lord Robens, but is not necessarily good for the morale of the miners, who, presumably, ought to be in the Government's mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose the object of this extension is to help the Coal Board to reduce its losses, but it will only reduce its losses in so far as it succeeds in getting lots of gas and oil. It seems to me, as a layman, that the more the Board succeeds on the gas and oil side the more it will be tempted to put its efforts into gas and oil and to put less effort into the coal side, so that when we come to the outlook of the miners in the industry it seems to me that the perspective is rather different from the perspective of Lord Robens. I have the impression that in many parts of the country miners are worried about their jobs, and if they see the oil and gas side of the Coal Board going well, will they have any reason to be less worried about their jobs? I think not. I think they will feel, rightly or wrongly, that they have more reason to be worried about their jobs in future, because one of the features of gas and oil, surely, is that they employ very few men, compared with the coal side. If one imagines what would happen if the Coal Board were to make a vast strike of oil or gas, I cannot think the miners are going to be encouraged. There will be pressure upon the Coal Board, which I think the Board will find it hard to resist, to exploit that strike to the utmost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with this point, and will he say what importance the Government attach to this question of morale? Is it in fact the object of this Clause to raise morale in the coal industry as a whole, or is it simply the object to give the Board the opportunity to reduce losses? Are the Government hoping that the Coal Board will not in fact use these powers or that any exploration it undertakes will be unsuccessful, or are they really hoping that the Coal Board will make very successful efforts to get into gas and oil? If it does, will not the coal side suffer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Parliamentary Secretary said that most of the questions raised in this debate were those raised on Second Reading, and that they were answered then, he must be responsible
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
for the euphemism of the week. If this Government answer at all they usually select some wholly different question from the one posed to them, one to which the answer is convenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least we have extracted this from the Parliamentary Secretary—that if there has been any inconsistency it is on the part of the right hon. Gentleman and himself. If he will look at the Report of the Second Reading debate the Parliamentary Secretary will see that his right hon. Friend gave a wholly different interpretation, with regard to the powers of the Coal Board in relation to selling this oil to a subsidiary, from that he has given. The Minister intervened in my speech to point out that any supply to a subsidiary would require his consent. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it wants to use it for a subsidiary, that would not be regarded as being itself within the meaning of the Measure and the Board would, therefore, have to get the Minister's permission.…"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 1st November, 1966; Vol. 735, c. 289.]</p></blockquote>
I pointed out to him at that time that the Continental Shelf Act specifically used the word "shall", and although it is not recorded in HANSARD he did in fact shake his head when I pointed out that this was a mandatory power for which he had to give permission for any of the purposes of Section 9(4) of the Continental Shelf Act. We have at least elicited from the Parliamentary Secretary today that this will be something for which the permission of the Minister is automatic. If there has been any inconsistency in dealing with this Measure it is an inconsistency between the Parliamentary Secretary and his right hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that although it is technically easy enough to dismiss Staveley Chemicals, because only a 45 per cent. interest is held by the National Coal Board, the rest is held by Stewart and Lloyds, which is in the process of being nationalised next door. There is an important constitutional aspect of this, although, here again, with the experience of the Prices and Incomes Act, one does not have great hopes about the respect the Government of the day have towards constitutional matters vital to our Parliamentary life.

	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, surely there is a distinction between the powers given to a nationalised corporation on the one hand and the licensing powers given to a Minister in such a Measure as the Continental Shelf Act on the other. It is right and proper that the Government, in setting up a nationalised organisation or amending its powers should ensure that those powers appear in the Measure setting it up or Amendments to it. Does it make sense, in this sphere, where the constitution of the nationalised industry is in the various Coal Board Acts, to alter or extend it by giving the Board powers under such a Measure as the Continental Shelf Act? That Act was designed for a wholly different purpose. The answer is that we should have in the Coal Board Acts a firm statement of the limits of the powers of the nationalised coal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put some specific questions about the Clause and I hope we shall have some specific answers. Subsection (1,	<i>a</i>) gives the Board power
	<br><blockquote><p>"to search and bore for and get petroleum within the meaning of the said Act of 1934 in the sea bed and subsoil of the territorial waters of the United Kingdom adjacent to Great Britain …".</p></blockquote>
I take it that that means the territorial waters of England, Scotland and Wales, but not Northern Ireland. Where does the dividing line come, as these are all parts of the same Realm? If there is no dividing line, is this not a nonsensical definition? Probably there is, and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary knows where, because this Bill has been carefully drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1,	<i>b</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where any crude natural gas or crude liquid petroleum has been got as aforesaid wholly or partly by or on behalf of the Board".</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that the Board is empowered
	<br><blockquote><p>"to engage at well-head or within Great Britain".</p></blockquote>
That is fair enough. It is empowered to engage in the treatment of gas in crude form at the wellhead. I would like an explanation of subparagraph (ii), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"at such other place, if any, as may be authorised by an order of the Minister of Power made by statutory instrument …".</p></blockquote>
What other stage or other place have the Parliamentary Secretary or the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Government in mind? It is obviously somewhere outside Great Britain because this is covered in paragraph (	<i>a</i>). It is presumably not in Northern Ireland, because, as far as I know, the Coal Acts do not extend to Northern Ireland, and great care has been taken to exclude Northern Ireland. I do not think that the remit of the Minister of Power extends to Northern Ireland in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is it suggested that if the Coal Board has a lucky strike it will pump to Holland and sell it to the Common Market, or Denmark, or some other country, and set up installations there? It does not seem to mean very much unless we have some idea of the sort of contingency this is supposed to cover.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further point is about the Order which will be laid before Parliament after being made. This excludes any Parliamentary procedures. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will confirm that or otherwise, and explain why it is that Parliament should not have some say as to whether it makes sense to give permission by an Order to set up operations in Denmark, or Holland, or somewhere else. I may be wrong, and I claim to be no draftsman. I hope that if I were I would make the Clause clearer than this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point concerns subsection (2), which refers to Section 1(2,	<i>f</i>) of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946. This says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"activities conducive to advancing the skill of persons employed or to be employed for the purposes of any of the activities aforesaid, or the efficiency of equipment and methods to be used therefor, including the provision by the Board themselves, and their assisting the provision by others, of facilities for training, education and research."</p></blockquote>
This seems to be a remarkable subsection of the original Act to be included in this Bill, when the Parliamentary Secretary has just told us that it would be only two or three chaps. As my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South Fylde (Colonel Lancaster) has been saying earlier, and I do not think there has been any disagreement across the Floor, these are matters in which companies, with much more experience than the Coal Board, rely on the experience of experts. By what possible argument can it be maintained that by giving the Coal Board powers to train people and so on for this operation we are increasing the resources available to this country for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
the exploitation of natural gas or petroleum or whatever it may be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is abundantly clear from the arguments which we have had, and it has not been contested in any way by the Government, that it is not a question of a shortage of expertise, but purely a question of the Coal Board making a financial contribution from which it hopes to get some benefit. If this is so, what is the object of providing the Board with powers to go for the training in skills in which it has no expertise to impart? Surely, this is duplication which is wholly unjustified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will be good enough to explain these points: firstly, the question of where the dividing line between Northern Ireland waters and Great Britain waters lies; secondly what is the intention of paragraph (	<i>b,</i> ii); thirdly, what control does Parliament have over the order, if it is made; and fourth, what is the object of the training falicities on the basis of the Parliamentary Secretary's enlightening admission that there will be only two or three chaps necessary to do this—or at any rate, they work in very small teams—and that the Coal Board has access to as good brains as any? Let them use these brains, but is it really the function of the Coal Board to set up a training school?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Question is, That the Clause——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh! No reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely we are to have an answer? They were specific questions, yet the Parlimentary Secretary just sits there. They were straightforward questions to which we are entitled to answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely wishing to give any hon. Member opposite who wished to speak an opportunity to do so. Certainly there was no intention to cut the debate short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Corfield) asked about Northern Ireland. The Coal Board has no powers to operate in Northern Ireland, and it did not seem desirable to raise the issues involved over Northern Ireland territorial waters and we therefore drafted the Bill so as to not raise these questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
The other question arises when the Minister is satisfied that the treatment of any gas discovered can most conveniently take place on the Continent or in Northern Ireland. It may be unlikely that this would be the case, but it cannot be totally excluded. The powers which restrict the Coal Board's normal activities to Great Britain would need specific amendment if gas were to be landed in some other country. It therefore seems wise to. make these provisions in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe these were the points the hon. Member raised. The only other question was raised by the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Blaker) who asked about the confidence of miners. It always seems dangerous to say what the miners ought to think. It is better to say what they do think. If the hon. Member will look at the proceedings of the National Union of Mineworkers' own conference he will see that they said that if there were to be exploration in the North Sea, which they welcomed, they wanted public participation and they would have no objection to the Coal Board taking part. I have talked to miners in many parts of the country and I am sure that this represents the reaction of the men in the pits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary has only answered one of the four questions, and I did recapitulate them so that he would have no difficulty in remembering them. He answered the question about paragraph (	<i>b,</i>ii) and he has confirmed my belief that if it were convenient gas could be landed in Denmark or Holland and treated there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely there is a further problem. We all accept the importance of exports, but there could be a situation in which it would be unfortunate if that sort of undertaking had to be carried out abroad rather than with British capital and, much more important, with British employees. This, I would have thought, would be vital to the morale of the miners. If one foresees treatment and selling operations abroad this underlines my point, which the Parliamentary Secretary ignores, that this is a matter on which Parliament should give some pronouncement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He has reinforced the argument that this is something requiring an affirmative Resolution, yet he has not told us
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
whether this Order which will be laid before Parliament even entitles us to the negative procedure. I would be grateful if he would divert his mind to these points rather than to making sarcastic comments on some of the questions which we have put.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point was on the distinction between the territorial waters of Great Britain and those of Northern Ireland. He told us that the Bill is drafted so that this does not arise. It does not give the Coal Board power to go drilling around in the territorial waters of Northern Ireland. Surely, then, he knows where the line is. I assume that those drafting this Bill had a map to give them some idea where the territorial waters of Northern Ireland are and where the territorial waters of Great Britain are. If the Bill was drafted with this in mind, to distinguish between the two, there must be a line on a map or chart which the draftsman had in mind. All I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to do is to tell us where it is. So far as I know, in the past, because we are a single Realm, it has not been necessary to make this definition, but presumably some arrangement has been made between the Minister or the Home Secretary and the Government of Northern Ireland about where this boundary line is. The Coal Board should certainly know, or we may run into great difficulties, with Northern Ireland becoming very worked up about the Coal Board operating in areas which the Irish wish to exploit for themselves and which most of us would wish that they should exploit for themselves, bearing in mind that Northern Ireland is consistently an area with difficult employment problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Parliamentary Secretary has not adverted at all to my remarks on the subject of subsection (2), which, as I was at pains to point out, brings in Section 1(2,	<i>f</i>) of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946. I thought that I was helping him by reading paragraph (	<i>f</i>) because he might not have brought his own copy of the Act with him. He sat down saying that he had answered all the questions, but in fact he had answered only half, having been asked four and having answered only two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Lancaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary was very kind and complimentary about me and I hope that he will not think that I am contentious in what I have to say, but I thought that I heard him say that expertise in geology, presumably referring to oil geology, was held in some very few hands. That came as a complete surprise to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Geology is a very widespread technique. I know perfectly well that in normal geological problems when one is trying to take on a new job one has to compete with the Dutch, Germans, Belgians, French, Italians, Americans, Canadians and so on. I keep closely in touch with the oil companies and I have never heard the big companies like Shell or B.P., or any of the consortia or anyone else, say that such a company's geological knowledge is obtained either from limited sources, or that matters connected with geological research of one sort or another are passed to very small concerns. Surely that is not the case, and surely in fact there are many geologists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I prefaced my original remarks by saying that I was only too conscious of the fact that I was speaking as a layman and that there were scores of people outside who could speak with greater emphasis and knowledge than I. However, I have been connected with geology all my life, and I assure the Parliamentary Secretary that he is wrong, and that geologists are widespread throughout the world, not only in oil companies, but in industrial concerns and nationalised industries. I do not think that any of the big companies would say that it could get the expertise required to solve a particular problem from one small source, and that so long as that source said that the company was on to a reasonable proposition, the company could take its word for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Parliamentary Secretary made no attempt to give us his opinion as to whether this would be considered as a speculative venture, whether, whether he recognised that the Coal Board would be a sleeping partner, or whether the Coal Board would be taking a calculated risk. If he is prepared to acknowledge that it is speculation, and a risk which cannot be calculated, and if he will acknowledge that the Coal Board will go into this venture as a sleeping partner,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
I am prepared to wish the Coal Board good luck. If that is what it regards as its purpose in life, and if it wants to put public money into the venture on that basis. I might be prepared to let the Bill go through and let the Coal Board go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to reply on those two issues. Does he really believe that there are a few people who are so expert that the rest of the world can say, "So long as they say that it is all right, we are on a good thing"? Does he admit, as he is being asked to do, that this is speculation pure and simple, and not a calculated risk, and that the Coal Board will be a sleeping partner in any concern and using public money in that way? If he would say those things, we might not vote against the Bill, but if he cannot say those things, we must fight the Bill to the last ditch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Are we to be told that the Parliamentary Secretary comes here without information from his own Ministry when that information is common knowledge to Esso and Shell? The hon.

What he is short of is having done his homework so that he can answer questions without sending little notes about the place.

the Opposition Front Bench to deal with——</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. As you know, Mr. Rogers, before the hon. Gentleman arrived this morning, I explained to you exactly what happened. I am not the least averse to explaining it in public. The Committee of Selection, which is controlled by the Government, could not be bothered to send out, at the post of a postage stamp, the details of the Membership of the Committee until 3.30 on Friday afternoon. Having made arrangements to be in my constituency on Monday, and having done that for the first time for a lot longer than the hon. Gentleman has been a Member of the House, I told my secretary that she could have the day off on Monday, which was a perfectly reasonable thing to do. In any case, the Parliamentary Secretary is entirely out of order. I have asked questions about the Bill which he has not answered. I do not want to be difficult about this, but I warn the hon. Gentleman that we can keep this Committee going till one o'clock and that there will be no question of sticking to any agreement about finishing by Tuesday unless he answers the questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This discussion has gone far enough. It is quite irrelevant to the Question before the Committee. I do not think that any further discussion on these lines will help the proceedings of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely what you say, Mr. Rogers, and utterly agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have checked the position of the territorial waters of the Isle of Man, which were greatly concerning the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Costain). A licence is already held by Isle of Man Petroleums Limited and therefore having already been granted somewhere else cannot presumably be granted to the Coal Board. The United Kingdom territorial waters adjacent to Northern Ireland follow the coastline of Northern Ireland and the territorial waters adjacent to Great Britain cannot be confused with those of the territorial waters adjacent to Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the question of the procedure under subsection (1,	<i>b,</i>ii) in relation to where the Coal Board may choose to
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
operate, we have followed the precedent of the Coal Industry Act, 1949, about the overseas activities of the Board. It is quite plain that the Minister can make a Statutory Instrument which brings about this effect and which has to be laid before Parliament, but which is not subject to the affirmative or negative procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the House were to be troubled with Statutory Instruments requiring its approval for this kind of degree of detail, the business of the House would be intolerably obstructed. Our intention is certainly to hold the Coal Board properly accountable and to maintain the right of Parliament to conduct the same kind of review of the Coal Board's activities in petroleum exploration as of its other activities. A very important part of that review, in which the hon. and gallant Member for South Fylde (Colonel Lancaster) himself takes part, is the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries. I am sure that that Select Committee, with its usual diligence, will keep a close eye on the Board's activities in exploration in the North Sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that there is a straight misunderstanding, no doubt due to my lack of clarity, about what I said about expertise in geological research. My point was simply that the individual teams advising any particular company on any particular local piece of exploration are very small, and that what matters in any project is the quality of that small team. Of course there are many such teams operating throughout the world for many different oil companies directly, and by contract as independent companies, and so on. There are many such petroleum geologists and such firms are active in this country. I will simply say that the Coal Board has the same access to this expertise as any other company and I was emphasising that many of the North Sea operators—although they have names which are renowned in the petroleum world—rely on the advice of these small outside teams in the same way as is open to the Coal Board or any other operator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and gallant Gentleman asked whether investment by the Board was speculative or a calculated risk. I think that this is more a matter of definition
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0312">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
than of any substantive argument. Of course, in making its decisions as to how to exercise any options that it may have the Board will calculate to the best of its ability and to the full extent of the knowledge available to it and to its advisers what risk should be undertaken in exploration, and what costs should be incurred in development. Therefore, in so far as these things are calculable at all, it will be a calculated risk and not mere speculation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are any other points which hon. Members have raised, and to which I have not replied, it is certainly no part of my intention to escape the issue. I have the impression that we are perhaps coming near to exhausting the inquiries of Members of the Committee about this very modest Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With due respect, I think that we shall exhaust our determination to inquiry very much quicker if the hon. Gentleman refrains from making remarks like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to bring the hon. Gentleman back to a serious, simple point which I made. I asked—and he has not answered me—about the real effect in Parliamentary terms of the phrase, "shall be laid before Parliament to get its confirmation". I am suggesting—and I think that this is serious, but the hon. Gentleman dismissed it in a rather superior way—that if the Minister is going to make an order for the exploitation of an indigenous natural resource abroad, this is something which, not necessarily always perhaps, but on occasions, Parliament may want, and ought, to consider and debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nonsense for the hon. Gentleman to say that we clutter up Parliamentary procedure by introducing the negative procedure. He knows that that is not true, or he ought to know. The defect in the Prayer procedure, in many cases, is not that it clutters up Parliament, but that Parliament is cluttered up by Prayers which cannot be fitted in within the 40-day limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that I am asking the hon. Gentleman to do—and perhaps he would listen and take this seriously, instead of adopting this rather superior attitude, because we might then get somewhere—is to say that he will seriously consider that this power should at least be made subject to
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
the negative procedure in case large quantities of gas are discovered. Indeed, it is very unlikely that the Minister would wish to give power, or the Coal Board would like to exercise that power abroad, unless the quantities were considerable. This may be earning currency as an export, but it is the exportation of a natural resource which means that our working force, our capital, and so on, does not develop it, but it is the next stage which might be the more profitable stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am asking a simple question. Will the hon. Gentleman say simply and politely that this point is worth looking at? If he does that, we can move on to something else. If he does not, I shall go on at this, because, to my way of thinking—and I see some hon. Gentlemen opposite agree with me—it is a valid point. I invite the hon. Gentleman to advert his mind to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Blaker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman claimed that he had answered all the points which had been raised. I congratulate him on having made progress in his attitude to this Committee, because not long ago he was saying that he need not answer the points which were raised this morning because they had been raised on Second Reading. I am a beginner in the House, but that is a new doctrine to me. I was under the impression that even if a point had been raised on Second Reading, the purpose of a Standing Committee was to examine the Bill in detail, and I hope that this doctrine that it is unnecessary for a Minister to deal with a point if it has been raised on Second Reading will not spread. I say that quite apart from the fact that the treatment which many points received on Second Reading was far from adequate, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has not dealt with the point which I raised about the future balance between the coal activities of the Board, and gas and oil activities, and the related question of the morale of those employed in the mines. The hon. Gentleman seemed to think that it was enough to say in reply to my point that I was dealing with what the miners ought to think, whereas what they do think is satisfactory, and they are perfectly happy. I am delighted to know that they are perfectly happy, but I was not talking
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0313">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
about the present state of mind of the miners. I was talking about what would happen in the future, perhaps some years in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the consequence if the Board makes a vast strike of oil or gas? What will happen when, inside the Board, there is a contest between its desire to reduce its losses by exploiting that strike to the full—which from a commercial point of view, and from the country's point of view, might well be a desirable thing to do—and its contrary desire not to see the coal mines severely hit, and very suddenly hit, and consequently the employment of miners badly affected? I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will not deal merely with the state of morale of the miners at the present time, because this is not the point at issue, but will deal with what will happen in the future. This is a question of substance, and I hope that he will deal with it on its merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intervene briefly merely to support the plea made by my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, South (Mr. Corfield) that the Minister should look again at the laying of a Statutory Instrument subject to the negative procedure. I think that hon. Members on both sides will join me in saying that in the House we are often frustrated in exercising proper control over nationalised and other Government bodies because there is too little opportunity, too little Parliamentary time, to exercise such control. The fact that there is a Select Committee dealing with nationalised industries is not a sufficient answer, because often, as in the case of the Public Accounts Committee, thing are examined after they have happened, and it is too late to take effective action. It may be nice to have a postmortem, but it is then a matter of academic interest, rather than possible for the House to exercise effective control. I hope that the Minister will treat this as a serious point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that if the hon. Gentleman introduces the negative procedure it will clutter up Parliamentary time. I do not think that we would often need to put down a Prayer, but I think that the House should be given the opportunity of doing so, otherwise we shall merely have a meaningless procedure in which the House can take no part.
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
I beg the hon. Gentleman to look at this again, because it is a serious point. It is not a question of bad temper between the two sides of the Committee. It is a serious point, on which some of us feel quite strongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of the Statutory Instrument, I think that the House is very properly concerned with the whole principle of the policy on the exploitation of North Sea gas, whether it be discovered by the Coal Board, or by some other explorer. The policy on this exploration is governed by the Petroleum Production Regulations which were subject to the negative procedure, and any revision of these Regulations will also be subject to the negative procedure. I would have thought, therefore, that the appropriate way to deal with this was not in relation to just one operator in the North Sea, but in relation to them all, if that is the wish of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am all for looking at the geographical reality here. The Coal Board will be operating in parts of the North Sea which are relatively remote from the Netherlands, or Belgium, or indeed Norway. If there is any possibility of, for example, a common distribution main from the gasfields in the North Sea, both to Europe and to this country, it would be much more likely to arise in relation to other operators. By raising the question in relation to just the Coal Board, which is only one operator, and differentiating between that one operators and all other operators, I do not think we shall tackle the question the right way from the point of view of Parliamentary accountability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this is a major question at all. We have to bear in mind the conditions which would be imposed not merely on the Coal Board, but on any partners with which it operated. If there were some different procedure, which I agree is extremely unlikely to arise anyway, it would still differentiate the position of the Coal Board from that of other operators. It would still prejudice the position of other operators who might co-operate with the Coal Board, and I therefore think it undesirable to produce even what would be, I accept, a minor discriminatory move, by making this subject to special parliamentary procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0314">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
The review carried out by the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries is not retrospective. The Reports and inquiries of the Select Committee are extremely interesting. They deal with many questions relating to the future policy of the industries. I shall not detain the Committee by referring to them at any length, but, if I may quote one example, the recommendation of the Select Committee on the policy for rural electrification persuaded the previous Government, and led this Government, to have a close look at the principles on which rural electrification should be continued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not encouraging the Committee to institute any revision of the Parliamentary procedure required here. I am not in any way seeking to undermine or to diminish the role of Parliament. Indeed, I am passionately committed as a Parliamentary reformer. I want to make sure that Members spend their time on the Floor of the House, and in Committee, in such a way as to enable them to examine things and events, and I am not sure that we would do so by the kind of device which is suggested here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A question was asked about the attitude the miners would take in the future. This is really asking for crystal ball gazing to an extent which I think would be quite impossible to deal with on any really fundamental question affecting the industry, let alone on anything which is a relatively small detail. We are not debating whether North Sea gas should be discovered or not. We are not debating whether North Sea gas if discovered should replace coal or oil. All that we are debating is whether the Coal Board should participate in North Sea gas exploration and development, and I cannot foresee any circumstances in which the miners' attitude would be anything other than in support of this operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hesitate to say that I have replied to all the points raised, because I fear that it might be impossible to do so to the satisfaction of all hon. Members. But I hope that we may make progress so as not to bring the Committee back again next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corfield</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the proceedings unnecessarily, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to think again about the Parliamentary procedure. I do not recall that the Petroleum Regulations, of which I do not have a copy today, in any way deal with the question of where a find is landed. If they do there may be an opportunity for debate. If I am wrong, the Parliamentary Secretary will no doubt explain why the general proposition as to whether the gas should be landed abroad is certainly not a specific question on a Coal Board investment. These powers may be operated only in conjunction with the two American companies, but presumably that does not tie the Board for all time not to operate as the Board itself. Occasions could arise when it would be right for Parliament to determine to have some say in the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of question I have in mind is where a possible landing place is on the shore of a development area in this country, where it would be particularly important to try to bring employment, and where, by bringing gas ashore, there would be an opportunity of creating a viable chemical industry or something of that sort which would be very much in the country's interests. There might well be a difference of opinion in Parliament as to whether it would be right to exploit it for immediate foreign exchange potentialities in, say, Denmark, or, for example, near Middlesbrough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a poor argument to say that one would be cluttering up Parliament with inessentials. The Parliamentary Secretary defeated that argument himself when he said that it would be so rarely that there would be an application to the Coal Board. We all know that very many hundreds of Statutory Instruments which are in theory subject to negative procedure go through every year without a Prayer being put down against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a very big concession and, speaking not merely from the point of view of this side of the Committee, I can foresee circumstances where the whole country and individual Members from constituencies where the alternative might lie might feel passionately about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would like to look up the Regulations on this. They are the Petroleum (Production) Regulations, 1966, paragraph 21(1). I do not think that there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1966-1967V010P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
is anything substantial in the point he makes. I do not say that there is no point, but that it is not very substantial. Without making any kind of commitment, I can say that I shall certainly have another look at this and seek the experts' advice. We do not need to be persuaded of the principle of Parliamentary accountability. We can have another look at this on Report. I think that that answers the point as fully as I can on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Colonel Lancaster</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parliamentary Secretary claimed, and he may have some justification, that this is not being gone into as an uncalculated risk, that the risk would be calculated. On Second Reading, the Minister was unable to estimate the amount which would be. involved in the investment. If the risk is calculated, surely we should be given some very general figures? Are we going to take a half, a quarter or a third share in the partnership? Shall we be prepared to see 10, a dozen, 20 or 30 bores undertaken? The Parliamentary Secretary recognises that boring in the North Sea for either gas or oil is very expensive. It costs about £500,000 per bore. Unless we can have some very general approximations for all this it is very difficult for us to accept that it will be a calculated risk. We do not know the calculations and the Committee has a right to be told by the Parliamentary Secretary what is generally in the Ministry's mind in regard to this investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well the Minister saying that he cannot give any approximation for this, but we are being asked to vote money to the Coal Board to take part in this development, and we must be given some general indication of what is involved. What are the terms under which we enter into partnership with Allied Chemicals and Gulf Oil, and to what extent shall we be able to determine the extent to which those companies which will be doing all the work and will be in charge, shall risk our money if a dozen bores prove to be failures? This might easily happen. Shall we say that we shall double the number of bores, and take our part in 24, 30, 40 or 50? There is no limit to what might be decided in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Geology is not a precise science. It is always open to a degree of speculation.
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
It must be, for otherwise life would be too easy for the oil companies and all of us. Therefore, we must see some limits to the amount of investment the Government are prepared to indulge in in this development. Nothing has been said today about that, although the question of what it will cost is fundamental to our whole discussion and approach to this problem. Can the Parliamentary Secretary give even the most general opinion on what part we shall play in this partnership and to what extent we shall determine how long the partnership continues if it turns out in the first place to be a failure? Do we call it a day or go on trying our hand till all reasonable prospect of success is exhausted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Bray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This information was given as fully as it exists at Second Reading, when it was said that £5 million or £6 million is the limit of cost expected in the exploration phase. If discoveries are made further capital will be required, but at the same time the returns are more certain. The detailed plans are a calculated risk. They need to be based on the latest information available at the time, and therefore, since the Coal Board is not able to enter into firm agreements till the Bill becomes an Act, the final details have yet to be settled and cannot be announced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
