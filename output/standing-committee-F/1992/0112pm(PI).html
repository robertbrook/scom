<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 86, in page 37, line 27, leave out "pay" and insert "remuneration".—[<i>Mr. McLoughlin.</i>]</p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following: amendment</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 99, in page 37, line 27, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) the provisions of any occupational pension scheme applying to the employee shall be treated as if they were terms and conditions of the employee's employment which would have been applicable to her if she had not been absent (and had not been pregnant or given birth to a child) and as terms and conditions of the employee's employment not relating to entitlement to pay.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment No. 100, in page 37, line 27, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), 'pay' means a woman's average weekly earnings which in the relevant period would have been paid to her during her maternity leave period under the contract of service with the employer in question and does not include any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which she would have received, directly or indirectly, in respect of her employment from her employer.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Government amendment No. 91.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Joyce Quin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before we adjourned we were discussing the definitions of pay and of remuneration and the Minister had responded to some of our questions about them. I asked whether the Government's definition of pay fitted in with the European definition in article 119 of the treaty of Rome. I also asked some questions, to which the Minister did not have time to reply, about whether the Department of Employment had a view on what the ultimate pay arrangement should be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is confused because we have moved on from that. The points about the relevance of pay are a matter for my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and are different from the Government amendments, which would change the definition to ensure that other benefits would be included in the Bill.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 314</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the amendments relate to what constitutes the definition of pay, but allied to that is our concern about what the Department of Employment favours as pay for mothers, and that is why I am making this point now. The Minister did not respond to that earlier and this is an appropriate time for him to do so. I hope that he will be able to give his Department's view.<br><br>
We asked specifically about the timing of decisions by the Department of Social Security. That is relevant to the position that we want to take on this and other amendments. When will a regulation—or whatever instrument is chosen—about the pay issue emerge from the Department of Social Security?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I responded to many of the points raised by the hon. Lady earlier today. As I said, the matter of pay will be dealt with by my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security, who hopes to make an announcement as soon as possible. I cannot say when that will be, but it will be in due course, and he will consider representations. The amendments go a long way to meeting some of the concerns which were reflected in the hon. Lady's amendment—and they are more concise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My apologies for being late. I should like to return to what I was saying earlier.<br><br>
What I want to explore with the Minister—who, I hope, will answer my questions—are my worries about replacing "pay" with "remuneration". I understand the problems of referring to "pay" and unless that word is changed, it could end up removing entitlement to other contractual rights.<br><br>
My worry is that by substituting the word remuneration for pay, we could be left with the same problem. I am reminded of discussions in relation to issues such as the taxation of company cars. It is often argued that a company car is part of or a proportion of an employee's remuneration. Those words are often used by the Inland Revenue. I fear that, even if the Minister does not intend it, if we use the word remuneration, it will start to cover items such as company cars, and shall rapidly reach the stage of removing entitlements to various benefits that are not strictly speaking "paid benefits". Has the Minister considered that aspect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason we have changed the wording to reflect what we are now suggesting is to cover the point which the hon. Gentleman is making—remuneration refers to everything that is not salary; any benefit that is not salary is included in the word remuneration. I think that the amendment should meet the hon Gentleman's concern.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hutton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: All Opposition Members are conscious of the predicament in which the Government find themselves, particularly due to the fact that the concept of pay could be wide enough to include other terms and conditions under a contract of employment, including pensions and other such items which the Government are anxious to exclude.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield that there is concern about substituting the word remuneration for pay. In the brief interlude between our proceedings this morning and this afternoon, I have tried
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0523">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 315</span>
to track down a statutory definition of the word remuneration. I have looked at the Wages Act 1986, the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 and a range of other statutes to discover whether there is some immediate and ready-to-hand definition that would resolve the central dilemma which confronts the Committee: how to exclude other terms and conditions from pay.<br><br>
In common with my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield, I am not convinced that the word remuneration achieves the Government's aim. The Minister may be aware of a statutory definition of the word. I have found a comment by Mr. Justice Blackburn in the case of R. <i>v.</i> Postmaster-General, which is recorded in volume one of the Queen's Bench divisions report on page 663:
<br><blockquote><p>"'Remuneration' is a wider term than 'salary'"</p></blockquote>
That was the central dilemma facing the Government: how to focus pay on a notion of salary. The Government's solution is to use the word remuneration, but Mr. Justice Blackburn says that remuneration is a wider term than salary. He goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"'Remuneration' means a quid pro quo. Whatever consideration a person gets for giving his services, seems to me a 'remuneration' for them. Consequently, if a person was in receipt of a payment or of a percentage, or any kind of payment which would not be an actual "money payment, the amount he would receive annually in respect of this would be 'remuneration'."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is confusing himself by using a different interpretation. We are referring to the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 which, as the Bill makes clear, gives a solid definition of the remuneration provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear the Minister's response. We are dealing with the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 and considering an amendment to it giving effect to the Government's commitment under the terms of the European directive. I press the Minister on this point: in which section of the 1978 Act is there a definition of the word remuneration? There are definitions of pay and of the concept of a week's pay, but a definition of remuneration has certainly escaped me. If the Minister has one, I should be happy to hear it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am told by those who are not seen on these occasions that remuneration is interpreted in schedule 14 of that Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to ask questions in this way as I know that no one is advising the Minister on this matter. Does schedule 14 relate to maternity pay or does it relate to some other benefit under the terms of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978?<br><br>
I might be able to help the Minister with this particular point. I can see that he is still awaiting unseen advice from non-existent persons. I have to rely on my memory and if it serves me well, schedule 14 defines a week's pay; but is not that definition given in the context of unfair dismissal? I give way to the Minister—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman can give way only if the Minister or someone else is going to rise. Strictly speaking, because the hon. Gentleman has sat
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 316</span>
down, I should now put the question, but I shall allow him to continue on the grounds that he did not realise what the rules of order are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your kindness, Mr. Knox. I thought that the Minister was on the tip of his toes, about to give me the information that I asked for.<br><br>
I am conscious that schedule 14 defines pay but I do not think that it relates specifically to these provisions. I would be happy to be proved wrong on that matter. I have looked at other statutes for a definition of remuneration that might be helpful to the Committee, but even if there is no statutory definition to hand, why does not the Minister propose a measure which defines remuneration precisely for the purposes of the clause? That would be a logical means of resolving this particular issue.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East said this morning, the background to our discussions today is the growing jurisprudence emerging from the European Court of Justice on the word "pay". In several cases involving article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, the European Court of Justice has been willing to interpret the word pay to include other terms and benefits such as pensions, holiday pay and other incidental benefits common under contracts of employment.<br><br>
The Committee must find a formulation for pay which will remove from the clause a possible intrusion by the Government into areas where they did not mean to interfere, primarily pensions, and particularly occupational pensions.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Northfield raised concerns about the Government's precise agenda on this part of the clause. We have tabled other amendments which aim to resolve the precise definition of pay, but I am not satisfied that the term remuneration is sufficiently succinct and precise to address the issues raised by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As a supplementary point before the Minister gets to his feet, can I ask him if he is aware of any difference between remuneration as denned in the 1978 Act and pay as defined in article 119 of the treaty of Rome? If the Minister could give us that information it might help us to understand the difference between the terms.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the Committee. The amendment substitutes remuneration for pay in new section 33, which ensures that contractual rights, with the exception of wages or salary, continue during maternity leave. It is a small amendment which ensures that the legislation achieves its intended effect and that the requirements of the directive are fully implemented. In accordance with the terms of the directive the new section provides that pay is excluded from the general provision that contractual rights continue during the 14 weeks of maternity leave. However, the use of "pay" in the Bill would risk too wide an interpretation by tribunals and could mean that benefits in kind might be withheld during maternity leave. It would also throw into doubt whether pension contributions are payable during this period, that is not the intention of the directive, nor ours in implementing it.<br><br>
Only the monetary elements of the contract are required not to be continued, but to be replaced by maternity pay.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0524">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 317</span>
The employee will continue to enjoy all the other benefits under her contract That is the important point and is clearly what is intended and, as I understand it, that is clearly what happens through changes that we are proposing to the Bill. I am assured that that goes a long way towards meeting the hon. Lady's amendment, but in a more concise manner.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments suggest that there is no difference between us on the intention of the clause. The problem is whether the clause as it stands says what we intend and whether, if it is enacted in its original form or as he intends to amend it, that will provide a hostage to fortune in future.<br><br>
If we cannot be certain of the definition of remuneration, it seems foolhardy to pass an amendment that includes that word, only to have to change it again later.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have expressed reservations about the use of the word remuneration and I am still not entirely clear about the Minister's objection to our amendment. It uses the word pay, but is intended to leave "non-pay" benefits intact. Our amendment tries to clarify that. What are the Minister's objections? At the very least, that would be better than the ambiguity of the word remuneration to which my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness has drawn attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are making heavy weather of this. Remuneration is the term used in the 1978 Act and covers only monetary elements of pay and not pension contributions and other parts of the package. The definition is used in schedule 14 which interprets weekly pay for all the rights in the 1978 Act. That is the normal use of the term for employee protection rights and industrial tribunals are used to interpreting it in that way. The EC directive on pregnant women refers to "payment" and "allowances" and not to "pay" as in article 119 of the treaty of Rome, and clearly intends the narrow interpretation that the amendment aims to ensure.<br><br>
I shall consider the issues that have been raised by the hon. Gentleman, but I assure him that, on the advice that I have been given—and we have considered this very closely during the past few weeks and also while the Committee has taken a break—the amendment meets the Opposition's requests but more succinctly than in their amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have listened carefully to the Minister. It is clear that the amendment is an improvement on the existing text. For that reason, we welcome it We also welcome the fact that the amendment meets the various issues raised by both our amendments to this part of the Bill. In light of that I do not want to press our amendments to a vote, but I hope that in response to my hon. Friends the Members for Barrow and Furness and for Northfield, the Minister will consider the points that we have made. If there seems to be a problem which would not fully translate the aims of our amendments through the Minister's amendment perhaps he would be good enough to write to us or to raise the matters with us.<br><br>
We accept what the Minister is trying to do, but the terms involved seem to have caused some doubts and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 318</span>
uncertainties in my mind and in those of my hon. Friends. I hope that the Minister will consider those points, although we shall not press our amendments. We certainly prefer the Government amendment to the existing text.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 98, in page 37, line 27, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) An employee's contract of employment shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to subsist during her maternity leave period.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is self-explanatory. It clarifies the wording of the Bill to show that an employee's contract of employment shall be deemed to subsist during her maternity leave. That means that unless the employee has formally resigned, her contract will be treated as continuing during her maternity leave and her employer will be duty-bound to take her back as long as that contract exists.<br><br>
The Minister may say that the Bill already covers that. However, we were keen to table the amendment because, from evidence provided to us, we are aware that in many cases, women experience problems in ensuring that their contracts are maintained during maternity leave.<br><br>
Once again, I should like to refer to the information that has been passed to us, in particular, but not exclusively from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. There is considerable evidence, especially in the report "Not in labour", to show that women have returned to work to find that their working conditions and contracts of employment have been changed during their absence. That should not be allowed to happen in normal circumstances. Later, we shall consider exceptional circumstances, such as redundancy, but at the moment, we are considering normal circumstances. Some examples are worthy of mention.<br><br>
One citizen advice bureau reported the case of a client who returned to work after maternity leave to be told that she was expected to travel to another office several miles away. Obviously, that would be extremely inconvenient especially just after giving birth.<br><br>
Another citizens advice bureau reported the case of a client whose wages always contained commission as an essential part of her wage. However, when she was on maternity leave and statutory maternity pay, the commission was stopped from her wages although her contract stated that it was still payable.<br><br>
Another case involved a client who was ready to return to work, but who was told that there was no work for her. She was told that she might be able to return to work later in the year. She was subsequently transferred to two other departments, which did not have adequate childminding facilities.<br><br>
Another citizens advice bureau reported the cases of several clients returning to work after maternity leave whose factory closed down for a "stop fortnight". The women were told that they were eligible for only six-and-a-half days pay, whereas everyone else, including people who had just started work, were paid for the full two weeks.<br><br>
There is another problem of which the Minister may not be aware. The attitude of some employers to pregnancy is such that, simply by informing them that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0525">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 319</span>
one is pregnant, a women may find that the terms and conditions of her employment have changed.<br><br>
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux quoted the example of a woman supervisor who received overtime. She was told that she must work the same hours without being paid overtime and that she would no longer be classed as a supervisor. Those examples make the situation clear. This morning, following the comments of the hon. Member for Finchley (Mr. Hartley), we discussed the variation in standards and practices of employers in different parts of Britain. I did not find that argument convincing partly because much of our evidence shows that, as one might expect, good and bad employers exist in all parts of the country.<br><br>
The examples in the report that I have mentioned have no geographical basis. Such cases arise everywhere. We may not like the fact that employers, sometimes even in our constituencies, behave in such a way, but we are all familiar with such occurrences.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will examine some of those cases. They deserve investigation. I hope also that he will agree that the amendment is important to ensure that the right for the contract to subsist during maternity leave is properly enshrined in the legislation. I look forward to the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Bill already provides that the terms of the contract of employment always continue throughout maternity leave, with the exception of wages. There is no question of the contrary being proved. Accordingly, the amendment is unnecessary, at least to the extent that it is intended to achieve that aim.<br><br>
The hon. Lady referred to the citizens advice bureaux report. Most of the women who suffered those unfortunate experiences had means of redress, but they failed to exercise their rights. We are providing additional rights, but the woman herself must take the decision not to pursue those rights.<br><br>
It is important to understand that the provisions are additional. The current wording of the Bill provides exactly what the hon. Lady wants in this case and, therefore, I believe her amendment to be unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little concerned by the Minister's reply, although I am glad that he clarified that the contract continues to exist during the maternity period. We introduced the amendment for that important reason. We are glad that the clarification will be written into the record of the Committee's proceedings.<br><br>
I was a little surprised, however, by the Minister's claim that most cases cited in the report were ones in which women had the right of redress but simply failed to exercise it. That greatly over-simplifies their position. If women have worked less than five years part time and less than two years full time they do not have protection against unfair dismissal. They certainly did not have that right when the report was compiled.<br><br>
The Minister forgets the difficulties faced by people who take issue with their employers, particularly in a harsh economic climate when they are worried about losing their jobs altogether. Even when, in theory, people have their rights enshrined in legislation, often practical circumstances can make them extremely reluctant to fight
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 320</span>
their corner, particularly in the absence of a union or of colleagues to back them up. The Minister should examine much more closely some of the unsatisfactory job conditions in Britain today.<br><br>
However, the Minister has given us assurances on the content of our amendment. That is my primary interest at this stage, so I do not want to press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 37, line 27, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) An employee may present a complaint to an industrial tribunal that her employer has failed to provide her with the benefit of the terms and conditions to which she is entitled during her maternity leave period.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3A) Where the industrial tribunal finds that the complaint is well-founded, it shall make a declaration to that effect and shall make an award of compensation to be paid to the complainant of such amount as the tribunal considers just and equitable in all the circumstances having regard to the loss sustained by the complainant.".</p></blockquote>
We feel strongly about the amendment. It picks up the threads of what the Minister said a few minutes ago about the possibility of women taking action against bad employers. Amendment No. 101 would make it possible for an employee to complain to an industrial tribunal when her employer had failed to provide her with the benefit of the terms and conditions to which she was entitled during her maternity leave.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
The Bill is vague about what remedy a woman would have if her employer failed to comply with the provisions of the Bill, particularly if the employer failed to treat her benefit as accruing over the 14 weeks of maternity leave. The Government might say that the woman could bring common law proceedings in the county court for breach of contract and that there was no need to provide an express sanction. However, most of us believe that that would be quite inadequate in Britain today, given the need to back up the right enshrined in the Bill with a proper system of arbitration and lodging complaints.<br><br>
We should also take into account that the Government were keen to bring forward plans for various sanctions on trade unions and to provide awards to individuals who had won cases against trade unions, yet there is no analogous provision for a woman whose employer has treated her badly or who has failed to abide by the terms of the contract in accordance with the Bill. We wish to set up a tribunal and complaints procedure, and we want women to be able to obtain compensatory awards. It is not easy to stand up to one's employer in difficult circumstances. It is particularly difficult for women who are pregnant, who have other things on their minds and who do not want a battle at their place of work. If the Government are willing to make even that modest improvement to maternity provisions, they should provide a proper vehicle so that those new rights can be properly and fairly applied in every workplace.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will look favourably on the amendment. It is unlikely that they will accept the amendment—the Minister nods in agreement. He might not accept the wording of the amendment, but I hope

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 321</span>
that he will be prepared to deal with the issue. Many Opposition Members consider that it is important. Indeed, some of my hon. Friends, in their previous existences, must have had experience of industrial tribunals, trying to get them to work in favour of employees who had been unfairly treated. They, too, must feel strongly about the matter. We look forward to hearing the Government's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) said that some of us would refer to our previous existences. It is particularly important that we should. Conservative Members have mentioned at least two previous activists in the NUM. In my previous work, I often found myself representing people at industrial tribunals who had left a company in far from satisfactory circumstances. One case related to a large multinational company. Subsequently, it corrected its procedure which no longer affects its employees. I shall not name the company, but, if the Minister wants a reference to that case, I shall be happy to oblige him with the details.<br><br>
In that case there was a failure on the part of the company to recognise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East pointed out, that a woman who had just had a child was, in some ways, in an elated state but, in many other ways, in a very stressed state. The arrangements that the employer sought to establish in negotiating a return to work for the woman from her maternity leave were very vague. Subsequently, they resulted in a redundancy which was proved to be outwith existing law. It was an extremely stressful time for the young woman involved, and that should never have been necessary.<br><br>
The point of the amendment is that there is a need, whether we like it or not, to establish a belt-and-braces procedure to ensure that women in such circumstances are not subject to potentially unfair treatment. There are several former lawyers among Conservative Members and I am sure that they are aware of the difficulties of representing distressed people.<br><br>
Reference has been made to the county courts in England, and there are parallel provisions in Scotland. Those courts do not provide the remedy that is needed in such cases because, in hearing arguments about breach of contract, they can consider only monetary loss. In the circumstances that we are discussing, other substantial losses must be taken into account, such as the effect on a woman's health of stress that an employer has wrongly caused her.<br><br>
I acknowledge that there have been great improvements in some larger enterprises in which good agreements have been negotiated with trade unions. However, in small and medium-sized companies there is, understandably, a lack of direct professional help in the personnel function which tends to be a devolved structure. That can result in some fairly bizarre, ad hoc decisions. In that context, we must ensure that women's rights are adequately protected. The reference in amendment No. 101 to a tribunal's ability to consider an award
<br><blockquote><p>"having regard to the loss sustained by the complainant"</p></blockquote>
is an important aspect of that. In such circumstances, it might go far beyond what is provided by the county courts of England and their parallels in the Scottish system.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 322</span>
The loss needs to be measured properly, using the analysis which was referred to this morning and which resulted in the establishment of costings. That goes far beyond simple pay issues and it should take into account a proper compensatory element. In that context, it is proper for that right to be established through the industrial tribunal procedure. I recognise that the wording might not be perfect, and I share my hon. Friend's view that we should ask the Minister to agree with the point in principle.<br><br>
If possible, let us move forward together to find a wording that adequately covers an extremely difficult set of circumstances to establish in one clause. It is difficult because there are many types of enterprise and because various considerations face the individual mother on her return to work. Against that background, I urge the Minister to take the amendment seriously and to find a way to accept the principles incorporated in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bil Olner <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will take the amendment into account. This morning, the hon. Member for Finchley made much of costs to employers. Much of this part of the Bill will protect pregnant women and their rights, but our amendments in particular will also protect good employers. I would not like to link all employers together. Some employers have an excellent track record. The amendment sets down in plain English what entitlements pregnant women can receive if they have a bad employer.<br><br>
I am grateful for the information that the citizens advice bureau has given to members of the Committee about cases that have been brought to their attention. Those cases are the tip of a large iceberg. The Minister said that some women had not pursued their cases. One difficulty, as many hon. Members will realise, is that, once one is outside a firm, it is difficult to pursue one's rights. One is on one's own when dealing with a large or small organisation, which can be a daunting prospect for people who want only to exercise their rights.<br><br>
The citizens advice bureau in Nuneaton corresponded with me because I am a member of the Committee. That bureau has encountered several cases of pregnant women who have recently been dismissed for what appear to be minor problems. But—there is always a "but" in such matters—those cases were not pursued. However, it seems that the reason for the dismissal of those women was that they fell pregnant.<br><br>
I cannot envisage the Government wanting to bring forward a Bill which hides natural justice, makes it difficult for pregnant women to obtain that natural justice, and does not give them dignity by ensuring that their rights are protected New subsection (3), which the amendment would insert in the Bill, would protect good employers from the bad practices of bad employers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are providing an express right for a woman who is denied the rights that the Committee apparently agrees to be hers; we are giving her the ability, in practice, to obtain redress through an industrial tribunal.<br><br>
We have discussed antenatal classes. Labour Members stressed the need to establish positive rights, not simply to decide whether an employer's refusal of access to antenatal classes was reasonable. Conservative Members replied that establishing a positive right was the wrong
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0527">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 323</span>
way of doing that because women in such a situation always have the right to redress from a tribunal.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
We were not over-confident that that response answered our point. Practically, redress for the refusal of access to antenatal classes some months, perhaps some years, after the baby is born is not much of a redress. There is perhaps one thing worse than saying, "All you need to do in that situation is to go to an industrial tribunal," and that is not to allow them the right to go to an industrial tribunal. That is the purpose of the clause. The legislation appears to be rooted in the European directive. Unless we insert the right to use the industrial tribunal system, the Bill will be in breach of the directive, article 12 of which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Member States shall introduce into their national legal systems such measures as are necessary to enable workers who consider themselves wronged … to pursue their claims by judicial process."</p></blockquote>
That right can be introduced in an entirely theoretical sense or in a real sense. The Government intend the former. In much the same way as they said previously, "You can always go off to a tribunal," they now say, "Well, you can always claim for breach of contract." It is important to ensure that there is a real right to seek redress, and if it is to mirror the rights conferred by other parts of employment law, to which I shall refer in a moment, it must involve the right to go as quickly as possible to an industrial tribunal, which must be able and directed to give sufficient remedy to serious problems. To say simply, "Go off, there is always recourse through the judicial system or a claim through the county court," or whatever, does not address the reality of employment relationships or the problems faced by women.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) referred to evidence submitted by the citizens advice bureaux. My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East has already referred to the problems that women face with employers who either do not know or are unsympathetic to the provisions in the law. With the Committee's permission, I should like to give a couple of extra examples, because it is important that we discuss the matter not just in theory but by considering real situations and people.<br><br>
A citizens advice bureau in south Wales reports the case of a woman who returned to work after maternity leave, having been told that she had to work a week in hand. The CAB telephoned the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which advised it that such practice was unlawful, but said that, as the client had worked for less than two years, she would not be protected from unfair dismissal. It seemed that, although such action was unlawful, nothing practical could be done. On her exchange with a member of ACAS, the representative of the CAB commented:
<br><blockquote><p>"When I said there may be a possibility of sex discrimination—comparing men who return to work after a similar period of illness—he replied—'you ladies are always red hot on sex discrimination'."</p></blockquote>
That was said by someone who works for an organisation which should be fairly sympathetic to the problem.<br><br>
A CAB in Hampshire reported a client who was told wrongly by her employer that she would have to repay her statutory maternity pay if she did not return to work
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 324</span>
after the baby was born. That is entirely wrong, but where is it laid down that she has an effective redress to that ruling? Nowhere. A CAB in Dorset reported a case of a client who left work to have a baby. She had worked for 39 hours a week for more than two years and she wished to return to work, but her employer offered her only six hours' work a week during the evening. Again, that highlights the real problem with the practical application of the law. The Government say that such problems arise from time to time, yet they will not enact an express provision to ensure that women have effective remedies for such problems. I disagree with that view.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East referred to our debates before Christmas. What a staggering turnaround is happening now from the arguments that were being put to the Committee before Christmas. We were not dealing then with the strange breed of the human race known as "women" who happen to have babies, but with those nasty organisations called trade unions.<br><br>
Before Christmas, we heard rumours of the problems with unions' accounts, with union officials fiddling the books and with elections being messed up and wrongly organised. Conservative Members said time and again that the problems with the trade union movement were such that the law had to intervene in an express way to ensure that individuals had the right of effective redress. Not only were the penalties specified clearly, but we were told that new organisations would be set up and that existing organisations would have their terms of reference expanded to meet those perceived problems.<br><br>
Opposition Members asked for a few examples of such problems. We wanted to know how the Government could justify not only the extra discussion in Committee, the paperwork and the entire procedure of introducing measures, but the cost of implementing that legislation. Few such examples were given. One was cited that went back a few years, but that was pretty shady. No concrete examples were needed to be given before Christmas when we were discussing invoking the panoply of the law, expanding it and to detail in express terms the protection for individuals to take action against trade unions.<br><br>
But when it comes to enforcing and respecting the rights of women, suddenly the approach turns on its head. Suddenly, there is no need for an express provision in law; all that is required is the comment, "Well, you can go to the county court". When we reconvened this afternoon, we told the Minister that such problems exist, but he said that people do not pursue their rights and that that was the difficulty. That is a problem for this country, not just for the individuals involved. If women are being discriminated against in that way and if the law on maternity is being abused, that is not a problem for the woman who is denied her rights, but an abuse of the law. As law-makers, we have a responsibility to ensure that the law is effective and that effective remedies are written into the law.<br><br>
The idea that the employment relationship is somehow equal is wrong. If an employer told a woman who had worked for less than two years—or perhaps more—that she must repay her statutory maternity pay, as in one of those CAB examples, she would know that that was not the law; but the relationship between her and her employer cannot be equal when the employer can threaten her with the sack. It is not easy for such a woman to stand
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0528">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 325</span>
up to her employer, saying that she knew the law was on her side. The real world is not like that; the employment relationship is not like that. Indeed, employment law was originally based on recognition of the master and servant relationship.<br><br>
Part II of the Bill is held up by the Government as positively promoting the rights of women, particularly pregnant women. They have gone to the press and elsewhere to applaud themselves and pat themselves on the back about how effective the Bill is. Will they just as publicly say that they will reject any mechanism to enforce those rights? Indeed, such a mechanism is suggested to them, with they say publicly that it is unnecessary, and that if a woman does not go to the county court to claim her rights, that is her problem, not the Government's? If the Government say that in such a bald manner—that is the implication of opposing the amendment—they will get a poor reception.<br><br>
The presumption throughout the Bill—it is particularly iniquitous in Part II—is that we should side with the employer, however unreasonable he may be. Earlier today, there was apparent agreement that antenatal care was important for the woman and for a successful childbirth. It was agreed that barriers should not be put in the way and that employers should not unreasonably refuse access to antenatal care. It was also agreed that parentcraft classes and relaxation classes should be included. If, however, an employer does not agree and tells a woman employee that she cannot attend a class, should that woman attend the class or not? I did not get an answer to that question this morning. The question is fundamental, because the Government seem to be saying that women will have many theoretical rights, but that if any employer decides to stand in the way of those rights, women will not be able to do anything about it. It is bad enough to say that they should have to go to an industrial tribunal rather than have those rights enforced there and then. Compared to all the other employment rights that we have spoken about today, which we all accept should continue when a woman exercises her right to maternity leave, it adds insult to injury to say that a woman should have to pursue her claim in the county court. Anyone who has been involved with industrial relations will know that that is highly impractical and that it does not offer anything to the woman. I hope that the Minister will think again.<br><br>
We are not attempting to be destructive. There will be plenty of other clauses which we shall oppose in principle. This is an area about which all hon. Members agree. The Labour party wants to give women the right to legal redress, which would be a similar right to that keenly given by the Minister to individuals in relation to trade unions. Surely that is not unreasonable. I hope that the Minister will accept either the amendment or the principles behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr.— Mr. Graham.</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought for a minute that you had forgotten me. Mr. Knox.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is never to be forgotten.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 326</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to be called. In the light of the Bill and the sensible amendment, I wonder whether the Government's comments have been inspired by the thoughts of John Knox and his attitude towards women.<br><br>
The amendment would introduce some humanity to the issue of the right of women to be heard before a tribunal. I am sure that the Prime Minister, with his citizens charter, would agree to that if he were here. I hope that the Minister will accept that this will be a way to allow employees an opportunity to go to a tribunal when they feel that they have been given roughshod treatment. Surely the Minister can take that on board.<br><br>
I know of plenty of good employers. Unfortunately, I know of many bad employers. I know that employed women are sometimes treated despicably. It is a male chauvinist world and, quite correctly, many women refer to male chauvinist pigs. We treat women shabbily. This is an opportunity for the Government to consider giving women proper redress. Women are entitled to have the right to be heard. I know of cases in which pregnant women have been more or less dismissed by an employer. A bad employer may put a woman on a heavy labouring job which could damage her health. She cannot do that job, so she has to leave the company. Companies may contrive to give women a hard time. Will the Minister consider that fact? The Government are not allowing women to seek redress for that type of distress.<br><br>
The amendment is sensible and compassionate. If the Government genuinely care about pregnant women in the workplace, there should be absolutely no difficulty in accepting the amendment. If the Minister knocks the amendment back, I hope that he will show it to his wife and daughter and listen to what they say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister acknowledged in his response to the opening comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East that there is a widespread injustice to women under the existing rules. He referred to cases from all over the country which citizens advice bureaux had drawn to our attention from the hundreds of thousands of cases on employment law with which they are now dealing. He said that women had failed to exercise their existing right to redress. He seemed to believe that it was acceptable to leave the matter there. If there is significant injustice because the law is inadequate, we must strengthen the law to reduce or get rid of that injustice. Surely that is our task. The Minister recognised that the law is inadequate. If we assume that the cases quoted by the citizens advice bureaux represent only a limited number of the women who have gone to them, we know that that is only a small sample of the women who are suffering from those wrongs.<br><br>
The situation is the classic one: everyone has the right to dine at the Ritz, but not everyone has the loot to pay the bill. Women have a right, but they are in no position to exercise it. We all know from our advice surgeries the spectrum of lack of knowledge and ability to secure redress. It starts with women who do not know that they are being wronged. It includes those who have a feeling that they are being wronged but cannot obtain advice on whether that is so. It also includes those who manage to track down through the labyrinth of society someone to give advice on the problem. The process is confusing, even for people who are familiar with the working of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0529">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 327</span>
society: for the large number of women who are not used to dealing with officialdom, it is daunting.<br><br>
Most people acknowledge, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield said, that the position of a woman in relation to her corporate employer is very weak. She needs advice and help to secure her rights, but the machinery for providing advice and helping people to secure their rights is being whittled away—although the word "whittle" does not reflect the magnitude of the cuts. In the past, many more people than at present had access to a trade union for advice, but the number of people belonging to trade unions has been substantially reduced, partly as a result of the Government's activities, in which they express such pride.<br><br>
Other sources of advice have been organisations such as citizens advice bureaux, but we know that, with cuts in local government funding and reductions in other funding for voluntary organisations, CABs are not springing up like mushrooms throughout the country. New CABs are not being opened and old ones are being closed, so another source of advice or help is disappearing.<br><br>
There are only a limited number of law centres. Some are threatened with closure and others are having to reduce their staff and their capacity to provide advice and help. Many women are left feeling dissatisfied with their treatment but do not know whether the law has been broken. Even when they know where to turn for advice, the advisory service might not be open long enough for them to get there outside work hours.<br><br>
Such problems have formed the basis of much of our discussion. We have reiterated time and again that to talk of an individual with no other help having a right in relation to a corporate employer is, by and large, tosh. As you know, Mr. Knox, the rules of order prevent me from saying what I really think. The system does not work unless the work force are well informed and are given help or advice when they need it. That help and advice are frequently unavailable.<br><br>
As my hon. Friends have pointed out, the provisions are in stark contrast to the rest of the Bill, where new powers, duties and responsibilities have been given to the various public officials who are to help individual trade unionists or, in the case of the latest proposition, individual vexatious litigants, to take action against trade unions. The Ministers who made those proposals could not produce a single, sustained example of the wrong that they claimed to be setting right. However, when the Labour party and the citizen advice bureaux offer legions of examples to all hon. Members of wrongs done to women, the Ministers come up with no means of redress. That is a remarkable contrast.<br><br>
As the Government are prepared to allow CABs, law centres and other advisory groups to be diminished gradually due to inadequate resources and are keen for the membership, resources and effectiveness of trade unions to be reduced, logically the Government should establish a new public busybody to do something for women who want advice and help. Is the Minister contemplating such a proposal? Will there be an employment inspectorate or an employment ombudsman? Will there be a mechanism provided by the Government and the state to help people with problems with their employer?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 328</span>
There is no doubt that, for each trade unionist with problems with his or her trade union, there are a thousand employees with problems with their employers. Either the Minister must accept the principle behind our amendment or he must come up with another way of making these rights on paper rights that can be exercised by women. If he will not agree to do that, we are back to describing most of these proposals as, at best, tosh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate on the amendment. I advise my hon. Friends not to accept the amendment: it provides a second avenue of redress to a particular class of employee which is not available to other employees. That is neither necessary nor justified. The circumstances envisaged by Opposition Members involve the employer withholding certain benefits due under the contract of employment from an employee who is on maternity leave. To do that would be a breach of contract. I hope that employers will not break their contracts with employees, whether or not they are on maternity leave, but employees already have means of redress through the civil courts if that happens.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Nuneaton referred on several occasions to people who had been dismissed. Such people have the right to take their case through industrial tribunals. The amendment would mean that if an employer denied a female employee some contractual benefit she could make a complaint to an industrial tribunal if she were on maternity leave at the time, but not if she were on holiday, off sick, or at work. Her fellow employees who suffered the same treatment would have to pursue their claims in one forum while she did so in another. That is neither necessary nor helpful.<br><br>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) asked about the changes introduced by the Bill. They are substantial.The changes remove the qualifying period of two or five years which was introduced in 1975 and they make it clear that any person who takes maternity leave by virtue of being pregnant will have the rights of protection that we have outlined. I believe that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras is on record as saying that only 16,000 women will benefit. That is not the case. We estimate that at least 180,000 women a year will gain from the changes that we envisage making through the directives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean that those women will benefit financially?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I mean that the benefit will be financial and will be as a result of the directive, which we shall implement with pleasure.<br><br>
Several Opposition Members asked me questions. If the hon. Member for Nuneaton reads his speech in the <i>Official Report,</i> he will see that he was referring to cases in which people were dismissed. In such cases, people have the right to take their case to industrial tribunals. The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham) asked whether, if I could not accept the amendment I would have the good grace to show it to my daughter and tell her what I had done. I shall do that but as she is only three years old, I do not think that she will be able to absorb the technicalities.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0530">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 329</span>
I was astounded to hear the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras say that the number of workers in trade unions had fallen as a direct result of the government's action—people not wanting to belong to trade unions may have more of an impact on trade union membership than anything that the Government have done. The Government have merely given people the opportunity to belong or not to belong to a trade union as they wish. We have abolished the closed shop which was supported by the Labour party.<br><br>
The changes that we are making in the Bill are significant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister says that he can tell us how many women will benefit financially from the measures, does he know the Government's decision on maternity pay? If so, could we share the privilege?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have made it quite plain. The directive ensures that provisions that we make regarding pay will be no worse than previous ones. As I have already said, my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security will make an announcement in due course.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. For the reasons that I have stated I believe that the amendment is unnecessary and I ask my hon. Friends to reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>; I had not intended to rise, but before we finish discussing the amendment, the Minister should consider the following. The centrepiece of his argument was that because employees who are not pregnant women were denied a contractual right and were forced to seek redress in the county court rather than at a tribunal it would be wrong to give pregnant women extra rights. There is an easy way round that—to ensure that men and women have decent rights and access to industrial tribunals.<br><br>
Without wanting to push the Minister so far down the road of progressive employment legislation, may I ask him why he does not apply the same logic to the question of employees' relationships with trade unions? The Minister believes that it is not wrong in principle for a woman to go to a tribunal, but that because others cannot do so it would be unfair to introduce legislation. How does he square that with the fact that the Government have introduced new so-called rights for individuals against trade unions, which allow them access to industrial tribunals on new issues and increase the maximum awards available? If it is wrong to give women extra rights, why is it acceptable to give individuals extra rights against trade unions? I do not follow the Government's logic—unless they are simply anti-union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister responds to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield, I should like to add something to my hon. Friend's comments. The Minister said that it would not be right to give women a special mode of redress which was not available to others, but when he was hyping up the Government's achievements in introducing the directive to legislation, he admitted—we are glad of that—that he had changed the rules relating to unfair dismissal of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 330</span>
pregnant women by removing the qualifying period. The qualifying periods of two years full time and five years part time will continue to apply to other employees, which constitutes discrimination. The Government cannot both claim that it would be unfair to introduce such a provision because it would discriminate against women and also announce that they are pleased to be discriminating in favour of women by removing the qualifying period for protection against unfair dismissal. That is illogical.<br><br>
We are glad that the qualifying period for women at work has been removed. But would not the Government have found it difficult to include qualifying periods in the directive because most—I think I am right in saying all—other European countries do not lay down the long qualifying periods that apply in this country?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have been clarifying a legal point with colleagues who are better qualified than I am.<br><br>
One point which the Minister failed to cover is the comparative position of the county court versus the industrial tribunal—I shall be careful because of the breadth of legal expertise on the Conservative Benches. The Minister referred to the county court and, although it is correct that in theory a woman could obtain a direct financial award following loss of wages or salary, there is no provision for any award to be granted in a breach of contract action which would reflect the stress, pressure and unnecessary trauma facing women in such circumstances. If the Government are genuinely trying to protect the interests of women, they must reconsider the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond to a few of the points that have been raised.<br><br>
Other parts of the Bill confer power on industrial tribunals to decide complaints of breach of contract However, when implemented, this would enable any employee in the specified circumstances to choose whether to pursue a complaint through the courts or tribunals. Following consultation on this proposal, the Government announced that they would extend the tribunals' jurisdiction in this way but only where the employment had terminated. I still believe that that is right. If we acceded to what the Opposition are pressing for, there would be a major change. Comment has been made about the necessity to define the position as clearly as possible and I agree with that.<br><br>
I accept that when the Bill is enacted and the necessary decisions have been made by my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security, the Government should provide information on what the regulations on employment and remuneration rights mean for pregnant women. That has not happened in the past. I accept that there has been confusion and that it has not been easy for people to understand the position. The information will explain the changes, but I must tell the hon. Member for Gateshead, East that I cannot advise my hon. Friends to accept the amendment, because it goes too wide. Important changes will be made under the Bill and some wholly new rights will be introduced for women, not only in this country but, following the EC directive, in other countries.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>6 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 87, in page 37, line 28, leave out from "to" to end of line 36 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"subsection (3), an employee's maternity leave period commences with the later of—
<ol>
<li>the first day on which she is absent from work wholly or partly because of pregnancy or childbirth, and</li>
<li>the first day on which she is so absent after the beginning of the eleventh week before the expected week of childbirth.".</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments No. 88 and No. 89.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The three Government amendments are purely drafting improvements. They would have no material effect on the provisions in the Bill and I hope that they will not detain us. The Bill as drafted leaves some element of uncertainty about the week to which line 36 refers. The amendments would simply ensure there is no doubt that "that week" would be the 11th week before the expected week of birth.<br><br>
The amendments clarify and slightly simplify the drafting, which is something that I hope all members of the Committee would applaud and accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are certainly not against the wording being made clearer, but we do not like the way that the Government have decided the timing of maternity leave. Opposition amendments would change that. We want the woman to have the main say in deciding when her maternity leave should begin, but I shall defer my comments on that until our amendments are discussed.<br><br>
I should like to question the Minister about these amendments. Page 31 of the original draft of the European directive tabled on 18 September 1990 stated, in proposed article 5, that the time of commencement of maternity leave
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be decided by the beneficiary, in accordance with national practice and legislation."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 332</span>
Article 8 of the final Council directive which was adopted on 19 October 1992 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"maternity leave of at least 14 weeks allocated before and/or after confinement in accordance with national legislation and/or practice."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to state that the maternity leave stipulated in paragraph (1) must include
<br><blockquote><p>"compulsory maternity leave of at least two weeks allocated before and/or after confinement in accordance with national legislation and/or practice."</p></blockquote>
Why was the final version of the directive different from the original draft? Which member states favoured the woman having the right to decide when her maternity leave begins? Which member states opposed the woman having that right? Does the directive reflect the Government's view all along or did other member states feel that the original proposals were inappropriate? Members of the Committee would be interested to have that information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the hon. Lady will want to discuss the wider issues concerning the timing of measures in other amendments. She was right to refer to article 8 of the 1992 directive because we are implementing those provisions today. I understand that the proposals came from the Dutch presidency. I cannot, however, tell the hon. Lady the ins and outs of how voting on such issues took place. We are complying with what was finally agreed to be included in the directive. The directive is our guide for the proposed legislation.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 102, in page 37, line 30, leave out "is absent from" and insert "stops".<br><br>
The amendment would give the woman employee the right to decide when her maternity leave starts. That the woman's maternity leave should begin when she stops work is far more satisfactory than the Government's proposals.<br><br>
I do not understand why the Government have decided to define the beginning of maternity leave in such a way. Perhaps the Minister could tell the Committee why the Government think that their proposals are the best way to define that aspect of maternity leave. Will the Minister also tell us whether employers and their organisations made representations to him on that issue? All the representations that Opposition members of the Committee received were in favour of the woman deciding when her maternity leave started. That would be far more sensible than having the artificial, automatic trigger point favoured by the Government.<br><br>
We are concerned that a woman who leaves work 11 weeks before the expected date of birth could find the 14-week period totally inadequate if the baby is late. Earlier my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) said that it was just possible that, if a baby arrived late, a woman would Have to return to work before the baby was born. I do not know what the Government's reaction to such a possibility would be, but surely it cannot be sensible to enshrine such a system in legislation.<br><br>
Why did the Government decide on that particular limit? Why have not they accepted some of the representations which we know have been made to the Government about the issue?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0532">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 333</span>
About 60 per cent of women in employment have, rightly, the entitlement to return to work up to 29 weeks after the confinement The provisions which the Government have enshrined in the clause mean that many women—particularly those with few employment rights, who are badly off and the most vulnerable—are not treated fairly. They are not treated fairly by the 14-week period, and certainly not by the compulsion to leave work at the beginning of the 11th week before the birth in circumstances described in the Bill.<br><br>
The evidence of the citizens advice bureaux shows that many employers can be hostile towards and uninformed about pregnancy—they assume that pregnant women should finish work as soon as possible. The wording of the original European directive makes it clear that it is understood that many women, for various reasons, might want to start maternity leave at a different time than is laid down in the Bill. I do not understand why the Government did not go along with the original draft of the European directive but opted for the formulation in the Bill.<br><br>
The Minister said that he was unable to give us any information about the attitude of other European Governments to the original directive. That is not very satisfactory—the directive was discussed for two long years at several meetings. The issue must have been discussed and the attitude of other European Governments must have been known. Perhaps the Minister could at least tell us what happens in other European Community countries regarding the beginning of the maternity leave period. Do other countries have a similar provision to that in the Bill? I doubt it, but we should like to know so that we can compare and contrast and come to a conclusion on this issue.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will respond sympathetically, although it seems unlikely, given that we know that representations have already been made and that the Government have come up with the minor drafting amendment that we have passed and have not got to grips with the substantive issue. What is the Government's problem in accepting that a woman should be able to choose when the maternity leave period begins? It is absurd that the maternity leave period could be triggered after one day of pregnancy-related absence although the woman does not want to finish work at that time, would like to continue work and would prefer to have more weeks off after the birth of the child than to have those to which she would be entitled before the birth.<br><br>
Those issues are important. I am sure that they are of interest to my hon. Friends. I hope that the Minister will take the issues seriously because they are something about which we feel strongly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hanson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the Government wish to ensure the health and safety of women and support for women in the community. The legislation should be about the health of the woman and of the prospective child, and to provide a legislative framework under which employers and employees recognise various rights. The proposal in the Bill and the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East contrast sharply. The Government's proposal suggests that the choice for the woman—who, along with the prospective child, should be the central feature of any legislation dealing with maternity—is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 334</span>
removed. The choice of when to start maternity leave is lost.<br><br>
I strongly support the amendment, which would provide the woman with the choice. The Bill shifts the balance of power in maternity legislation from the employee to the employer and the balance of choice from the employee to the employer. It shifts the decision on the commencement of maternity leave from the employee—the woman, whose child should be central to that decision—to the employer.<br><br>
6.15 pm<br><br>
After the 11th week plus one day before the confinement the woman could be absent from work for a day because of a pregnancy-related illness or because she is over tired due to the pregnancy. She may be able to work until one or two weeks before confinement, but may simply have a bad week because of the pregnancy. She may feel that it would not be for the good of the child or herself to attend work on one day, but could have six, seven, eight or nine weeks of work ahead of her. She may wish to carry on working and that may even benefit her employer. She may have one or two bad days, but apart from that be able to continue to work adequately until she chose to take maternity leave for the good of herself and her child. The Bill will remove that choice and trigger the start of maternity leave, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East said, on the day the woman misses work because of the pregnancy. That cannot be right.<br><br>
The Bill encapsulates the notion that women are unable to work throughout pregnancy. It assumes that if a woman misses work for one or two days, she will be unable to work for the remainder of the pregnancy. That assumption is wrong. As the father of three children I watched my wife work through each pregnancy. When she was pregnant with our youngest child two and a half years ago, there was a period during the 10th or 11th week when she felt ropey and was absent from work for one or two days, but she returned to work. In addition, she was the mayor and chairman of the housing committee, and also helped me in the selection procedure leading to my election to the House. She was not incapable of work, but simply felt bad during the 10th or 11th week of pregnancy.<br><br>
The Bill encapsulates the attitude that pregnancy means inability to work, which is a 19th century idea. Pregnancy is a natural bodily function which results in the birth of a child and does not necessarily incapacitate a woman.<br><br>
As well as encapsulating backward ideas, the Bill raises two other issues which I ask the Minister to consider. Let us assume that a woman felt ill and unable to work at the 10th or 11th week of her pregnancy but had planned to take her maternity leave at the third week before her confinement. Consider the stress on that woman if she felt that she had to drag herself to work before that leave was due to commence. In doing so, she could further worsen her health and" perhaps that of the baby which would cause additional stress to both. That is unnecessary, and if the Bill is passed unamended it will provide that maternity leave commences "wholly or partly" at the 11th week if a person misses a day's work as a result of pregnancy.<br><br>
I do not believe that any Conservative Member wishes to add to the stress of the woman or her child during
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0533">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 335</span>
pregnancy, but that could be the effect of the clause. Given what the Government and the European Community are trying to achieve, that could damage the women and unborn children whom they seek to protect who form a triumvirate with employers. If a woman misses two or three days' work, should that add to her stress and lead to difficulties later in her pregnancy?<br><br>
People plan their lives and employers may plan the replacement of such women during maternity leave, if two or three bad days around the 11th week of pregnancy are taken to mean that maternity leave has commenced, surely, that will disturb the plans of the employer and add to the stress of the woman and her unborn child. That will not be helpful.<br><br>
The second matter that I ask the Minister to consider is redress. If a woman has a difficult time for a few days and her employer says, "I am sorry, but we are now commencing your maternity leave because you have been off for three or four days, even though you told me that you wanted to work until the third week before confinement", what redress is available to that woman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend says. Has he considered that it might be in an employer's interest for the woman to work longer after the 11th week? The employer might also be caught under the provisions of the clause, and that would be unsatisfactory for both.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is cause for concern because employers will wish to plan for the future, especially those in small businesses where forward planning is essential. Under the Bill, an absence of only a day could lead to the clause being invoked and cause difficulties for pregnant women and employers in both small and major businesses.<br><br>
What redress will a woman have who experiences difficulties for one or two days if her employer invokes the clause and says, "Your maternity leave has commenced because it is not in my interests for you to continue to work as planned until the third week before your confinement"? There may have been an agreement between an employer and a female employee for plans to be made after she has said that she will be off work from three weeks before her confinement. The employer may accept that, but a sudden pregnancy-related illness may mean that the employee is off work for two or three days. If the employer says that all other arrangements are tosh, to use the word of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, the agreements go out of the window and the woman is on maternity leave. That is not in the interests of either party, the community, or the child yet to be born. The Government should think again. If they do not absorb some of our arguments, I shall ask my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead East to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The anecdote of my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) about his family circumstances illustrates one matter that I wished to mention—the tremendous variation in the wishes of women in such circumstances. My hon. Friend's partner, who I have known for many years, has achieved remarkable things during times of confinement and soon after. That contrasts starkly with us men. Having watched
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 336</span>
my own three children being born, I am now a devout coward and would not want to do it again, let alone go through the problems and difficulties faced by women at that time.<br><br>
Individual women and their families face many different problems in the time surrounding a confinement. Those differences will depend on family circumstances, the need to give support to other children on the imminent arrival of the new baby, with its associated psychological problems, through to the other end of the spectrum, where, perhaps in the best interests of the new child, the mother wants the maximum time off afterwards. The whole spectrum of possibilities is affected by difficulties of travel, lack of provision for nursery care and so on. Those are reasons to support the amendment<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn referred to the difficulties that employers may face, when they find themselves without particular expertise. I remember a case, which the Minister may wish to refer to the Department for Education, of a head teacher who, under the provisions for the local management of schools, is being denied the right to take maternity leave by the school's governing body. Other difficulties are caused by the way that the Government seek to restructure society. For small and medium-sized firms, one person may carry out a function, and a snap decision by an employee would cause them difficulties, just as it would if an employee happened to the or was run over by a bus. Surely, good management is about coping with such difficulties. They should plan for such eventualities. One of the great benefits of maternity leave—which, besides the biological difference, distinguishes it from sickness absence—is that planning is possible. When, because of the number on the payroll, circumstances may prove difficult an employer can say, "Ideally, if all goes well, when would it suit you to start your maternity leave?" That is a part of the planning process that one would expect from good management.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
On the principal that none of us is indispensable, a good employer must have contingency plans for somebody who is not at work for a short period. The Government's arguments about the difficulties faced by small and medium-sized employers should be counterbalanced by their responsibility to promote good management practice amongst such companies. My hon. Friends argued for other aspects of good employment practice when discussing earlier clauses, but this aspect is particularly important because it affects such a large percentage of employees—potentially, 52 per cent of the population and extremely large percentages of the work force of some enterprises. A well run company must plan ahead, working in the best interests of all parties, which must include welfare and interests of the future child, other children, the mother and the enterprise. Common sense dictates that there should be flexibility. A rigid interpretation of the clause could create difficulties for an employer, and it will certainly create difficulties for the woman, the future child and other members of the family.<br><br>
I urge the Government to reconsider and accept the simple amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East, which would ensure that common sense prevailed.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0534">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 337</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause, unamended, will give no advantage to a responsible employer. It will curtail the freedom of choice of pregnant women and provide new benefits and rights for the employer who is irresponsible, ignorant of the law or heedless of the law's provisions. The clause will provide for the first time for a woman to be bounced into taking maternity leave when she does not wish to. That is an unfortunate restriction and diminishes existing rights under maternity laws. The Bill is trumpeted as an improvement of maternity rights, so it is rather odd that it actually reduces them.<br><br>
Labour members of the Committee do not believe that the majority of employers fall into the categories of irresponsibility or of ignorance of or heedlessness of the law. But such categories of employer exist. Graphic examples of them have helpfully been provided by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. Some of my hon. Friends have referred to those examples and they are sufficiently important to quote from.<br><br>
A CAB in the north-east reported the case of a client who worked as care assistant in a residential home. The proprietor of the home dismissed her, saying
<br><blockquote><p>"It isn't very nice having someone with a big belly working here."</p></blockquote>
A CAB in south Wales reported the case of
<br><blockquote><p>"a client who notifed her employer that she would be starting her maternity leave six weeks before the baby is due. He is stating that she must finish 11 weeks before the baby is due."</p></blockquote>
That example does not illustrate the point as graphically as the case in the north-east and there is not a direct threat of dismissal, but the implication is the same: that employer believes that the woman should not continue to work beyond the 11th week and is trying to enforce that view.<br><br>
The existence of a clause concerning women who have a pregnancy-related illness and take time off work does not cause such things to happen. But given the combination of the bad attitude of some employers—I imagine that women or men working for such employers will be off much of the time—and a woman being off work, what kind of attitude will be bred in those employers by the clause as it stands? The attitude will be that if a woman is off work because of a pregnancy-related illness, she is almost, by definition, incapable of going back to work until after the baby is born. Where is the medical evidence to suggest that? Where is the advice that, purely because a woman has been off for a day after the beginning of the 11th week before the expected birth, she is incapable of going back to work? Will that kind of logic counteract the view held by the unreasonable, ignorant, couldn't-care-less employers or will it encourage such a view among those employers? I believe that it will do nothing but encourage that view.<br><br>
The Minister will say that the illness cannot be any old illness, but it must be pregnancy related. Where is the definition of a pregnancy-related illness? Where is the definition in relation to that kind of employer? I imagine that an employer who takes the view to which I referred would conclude that any illness or any reason for a woman being off work if she is pregnant must be something to do with the fact that she has the unfortunate problem of being pregnant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend talks about definitions. Where is the definition of absent from work? I shall be interested in hearing from the Minister what it means. It
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 338</span>
could mean when a woman leaves at 12 o'clock or 3 o'clock because she is not feeling well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a valid point. Many experts have suggested that the technical aspects of the clause will create a legal minefield. I hesitate to use the term "vexatious litigant" again in the Committee. However, I can imagine the kind of cases that could occur over interpretations of what a pregnancy-related illness is and what absence from work is. The clause will create many hostages to fortune.<br><br>
The clause is not practical. It is also probably contrary to the directive to which the bill is meant to be given effect. Article I (3) provides that no legislation introduced as a result of the pregnant women at work directive should involve a diminution of rights in member states. At present, a woman must give notice of her intention to take maternity leave and can choose when she starts that leave. The clause will diminish that right.<br><br>
Under the Bill, if the woman is off work for what is regarded to be a pregnancy related illness, she will be deemed to have started her maternity leave. That is a diminution of existing provisions under British law and is probably not permitted under European directives. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether that issue has been examined and whether the Government are confident that the clause will be permitted under European law? That is another reason for amending the clause in the way that was suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East.<br><br>
However, that the clause may be out of line with European legislation is not the most compelling reason why it should be amended. While a convincing argument for the amendment is concerned with practicality, the most powerful is that of choice. Women have the right to decide when to start their maternity leave, but if the Government do not amend the clause, they will restrict that right.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East referred to one practical aspect, but several ludicrous situations can arise from the measure. A woman could be deemed to have started her maternity leave not when she is off sick, but when she is at work. Because no notice of commencement of maternity leave will be required under the 14 weeks' provision, she will be deemed to have started that leave if she is off sick from work because of pregnancy related illness after the commencement of the 11th week. What would happen if, after one day's sickness from work, the woman felt better? I must say to my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn that if I were the mayor of a local town or were involved in the selection procedure for coming to this place, I would be off for rather more than one day.<br><br>
I am referring now not to an irresponsible employer, but to a responsible employer. Let us suppose that some important business is taking place regarding his firm, which requires the woman's attendance because she is an important member of the working team. What would happen if she felt better after being off work for one day, and neither she nor her employer wanted her to start her maternity leave at that time, so it was agreed that she went back to work?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Depending on the Government's eventual decision about pay, might it not be a financial incentive
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0535">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 339</span>
to the woman to continue work, if she possibly can, because of the gap between maternity pay and her earnings? The position that my hon. Friend is describing would then arise, whereby she is deemed to be on maternity leave when she is still at work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Borden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right: she has highlighted the ludicrous situation that could arise under the Bill and how inadequate it is. We must bear in mind how generous the Government will be—perhaps generous is not the correct word to use in that context—in maternity provision. Even if we were at the top of the league instead of at the bottom for maternity provision, many women would wish to continue working beyond the 11th week, because that would be in the interests of themselves and the firms for which they work, so they would think that that was right.<br><br>
Our provisions are dreadful; perhaps I should complete the Minister's list He cited other European countries which have smaller proportions of women in employment than Britain, but he left out Denmark. That country has a higher proportion of women in employment than Britain and it is also at the top of the league of maternity rights.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the hon. Gentleman? As he will see when he reads the <i>Official Report,</i> I referred to Denmark, which was also referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste) who spoke about the troubles that were accruing in that country. We had a very lengthy discussion about Denmark but perhaps the hon. Gentleman was not paying attention at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I do not wish to prolong the subject but I referred to Denmark in my opening remarks. The Minister cast doubt on what I was saying and spoke about areas that have better maternity provisions, but what was significant in what he said is that the proportion of women employed in those states is smaller than it is in Britain. I shall certainly read the <i>Official Report,</i> but at the time I was waiting for Denmark to be mentioned and it was not. Being a sceptical soul, I wondered whether that was because it not only has a higher proportion of women in employment than Britain but is top of the league in maternity rights. I shall take the Minister's advice and read the <i>Official Report</i> and if Denmark and all the information about its maternity rights and the percentage of women in employment appears in it I shall be more than happy.<br><br>
Let us assume that Britain was at the top of the league and that there had been a sea change in the Government's views on the rights of women. In that case, there is no doubt that some women would wish to work beyond the 11th week. However, we are not at the top of the league but right down at the bottom. Therefore, the Government should be aware that they are encouraging women, for financial and other reasons, to work beyond the 11th week. One of the results of keeping down the number of weeks of maternity leave is to encourage women to take less time off before the birth and more time off afterwards.<br><br>
The complete lack of parental leave in Britain is further encouragement for women to take less time off before a birth and as much time as possible afterwards. As
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 340</span>
responsible prospective mothers, they will regard that as sensible.<br><br>
I believe that women should have that choice but even if the Minister disagrees and places less store on the right of women to choose, surely he should recognise that he should remove the barriers to women starting their maternity leave at the commencement of the 11th week or thereabout. The best way to remove them would be to increase the total amount of maternity leave available under legislation in Britain and by introducing parental leave. At two strokes, he would achieve what he seems to want to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we have not been told by the Minister why the 11th week should be arbitrarily chosen? We have heard no medical evidence nor evidence from employers who have discovered that expectant mothers in their employ have been absent beyond the 11th week before confinement</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and he is right. The right to take maternity leave from the 11th week is correct but there is no basis for suggesting to an employer or a woman, against her better judgment that there is pressure to take it. More importantly, there is certainly no basis for suggesting that if someone is off sick for one day after the 11th week, she must by definition, be on maternity leave from that day until the birth of the child. No evidence has been presented to demonstrate that and the Government have not made their case.<br><br>
I have referred to the ludicrous situation in which a woman at work may find herself still deemed to be on maternity leave. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey also referred to the most ludicrous situation that could arise when women are forced to commence their maternity leave before they wish to do so and they may have to return to work before their babies are born. The culprit for that is the fact that overall maternity provisions in Britain are not good enough: they do not provide an adequate number of weeks to cover most of the eventualities that may occur. Because of the proportion of women who have their babies later than anticipated, the Maternity Alliance estimates that several hundred women every year may have to return to work before their babies are born. That estimate is based on the percentages of late births and the fact that some women are forced to commence their maternity leave before they wish to do so.<br><br>
The problem is avoidable. We do not need to force women to act in this way or to diminish existing maternity rights as the clause does. The problem can be overcome by accepting the principles in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East. A longer-term solution can be found by accepting some of our later amendments, which would expand the amount of maternity leave available to women.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am at a total loss, having listened to the hon. Member for Northfield, to understand how something that changes the legal basis can be a diminution of rights. There is no present right to maternity leave, but only to absence for those who have two years' service. So the new right to leave that the Bill introduces cannot, by any description—even by the Opposition—be a diminution of rights.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make progress and the hon. Gentleman spoke for some time.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Antrim, East (Mr. Beggs) asked why the proposal referred to the 11th week. I shall answer that in detail shortly. In general, as now, it is up to the individual to decide when she wants to stop work to have her baby. However, she cannot begin her statutory leave before the beginning of the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth. Again, that is the same as under present provisions. If she is already away from work—for example on doctor's orders—her 14-week period of leave does not begin to run until the 11th week unless she has had the baby early. In that case, the leave period begins on the day the baby is born.<br><br>
As for the triggering of the maternity leave period by a single day off after the 11th week before the baby is expected to be born, maternity leave will begin only if the woman is away from work for a maternity-related reason. For example, a day off because of a bad cold would not trigger the start of the 14-week period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can first finish this point.<br><br>
It would be an additional burden on employers to allow women to take time off because of their pregnancy in the 11 weeks leading up to the expected birth while still preserving their entitlement to a full 14 week's leave. The 11th week is the earliest date, under existing provisions, that a woman can choose to stop work and retain her right to return. The provision must allow her to choose to stop that early, otherwise we may diminish the rights of the pregnant woman, which we cannot do under the directive. It is, therefore, important to allow her to go up to the eleventh week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the draft, the Minister says that the absence is wholly or partly due to pregnancy or childbirth. My hon. Friend the Member for Northfield made the point that it might be extremely difficult to define that If the clause remains unamended, how will the woman and the employer determine whether the absence is specifically related to the pregnancy, either wholly or partially? Will the legislation keep the legal profession busy but do nothing to enhance the relationship between the woman and her employer—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has forgotten or overlooked the fact that a day's sick leave requires self-certification. If the sick leave is longer than the period of self-certification, which I think is three or four days, I am not sure—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the contract of employment</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. It could be three or four days, so the woman involved would give her reason for being off sick. If a medical note were required, the doctor's advice would be sought. Some of the Opposition's arguments have no foundation.<br><br>
If an employer agreed a different period of maternity leave, that could be accommodated. Hon. Members referred to the woman who works for a small company
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 342</span>
and because she has taken a day off sick, her employers do not want her to begin her maternity leave at that point. That could be agreed by the employer and the woman involved. I hope that that answers the point made by the hon. Member for Delyn. There is no question of a woman being required to return to work before she has had her baby. The Bill is designed to ensure that in the unlikely circumstances that hon. Members have described, the woman's leave would be extended until the birth, after which she would have a further two weeks compulsory leave.<br><br>
Even if a woman started her leave on the first day of week 11, and after the 11 weeks she had not had her baby, she would still have a further three weeks under the 14-week procedure. She would then have a further two weeks compulsory leave once the baby was born. That will be dealt with by the health and safety regulations that will be introduced as a result of the directive.<br><br>
I understand hon. Members' concerns, but they have been over emphasised and I do not believe that we need to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We still have questions in our minds about this part of the Bill, even in the light of the Minister's assurances. He referred to an agreement between the employee and the employer about when to trigger maternity leave. Will he explain that in more detail? It appears that for fear of breaking the law, it would be very difficult for an employer and an employee to agree anything that was outside the terms of the Bill. For example, a woman who had had three or four days of pregnancy-related sickness around the 11th week would not appear, according to the Bill, to be able to continue work after that sickness, even if she were able and willing to do so and her employer were happy for her to do so. The Bill is not flexible in that regard. Yet the Minister's reply seemed to hint that there might be circumstances in which both employer and employee could agree that such a woman could continue to work beyond the 11th week.<br><br>
7 pm<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will respond directly to this important matter. Many of the organisations that have lobbied Opposition Members will be interested if the Bill contains greater flexibility than appears to be the case. However, if that flexibility is not available, the Minister should consider seriously changing the terms of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The contractual agreement between employer and employee would override the Bill in those circumstances. If an employer decided that the best interests of his company would be served by allowing a woman in the circumstances described by the hon. Lady to return to work for as long as she wished before her confinement began, that would be allowable and in order. The encouraging nods that I am receiving show that I am on the right track.<br><br>
If an employee is off sick for a reason that is not related to pregnancy, the employer cannot invoke the start of the maternity leave period. If he tried to do so, the employee could claim unfair dismissal and could take her case to a tribunal. That covers a question raised by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to press the Minister further on the question of related illnesses. Back problems often feature
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0537">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 343</span>
in industrial injury hearings at tribunal level and in the courts. If, under the self-certification process, a woman certifies that her absence from work is the result of a back problem, how can an employer, in the context of employment contracts and of the Bill, determine whether that complaint is wholly or partly related to her pregnancy? Apart from a few teaching hospitals, no employer could make that judgment. It would be crazy to allow such a difficulty to evolve, as it would open up opportunities for both vexatious and frustrated litigants.<br><br>
Would not the Minister be better advised to consider the enouragement of good management practices witiiin companies, as I advocated earlier? That would require pre-planning for the inevitable circumstances of confinement and would be far better than creating difficulties that can be resolved only through extensive and expensive litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to press the Minister on his otiier reply, for which he was rewarded witii encouraging nods from his officials. I do not understand how, given the wording of the Bill, the Minister can maintain that a maternity leave should start from the date agreed in the contractual agreement between an employer and a pregnant woman, even if the woman has suffered a pregnancy-related illness after the start of the 11th week. I do not agree with the Bill, but it seems to be clear. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (3), where that day is before the beginning of the eleventh week before the expected week of childbirth, her maternity leave period commences with the first day on which she is so absent after the beginning of that week."</p></blockquote>
There is no doubt about it: that is when maternity leave commences. It is not a matter of when she is entitied to let it commence or of when its commencement has been agreed. Nor did I realise that the contractual arrangement between an employee and an employer could override statute. If that is so, it has interesting implications, not only for maternity rights but for every employment right. The Minister should clarify that. Perhaps he will give us some more encouraging nods and explain the basis for them.<br><br>
If an agreement is accepted between an employer and a woman, that maternity leave need not commence if the woman has taken only one day off for pregnancy-related sickness. Why cannot the woman's choice be accepted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Olner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no problem with the words, "is absent from". They would be acceptable if the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"wholly or partly because of pregnancy",</p></blockquote>
was removed. Replacing "is absent from" with "stops" would clarify the provision. The clause causes difficulties, because, as it stands, an absence could be judged to be the beginning of maternity leave. That matter should be clarified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Northfield, I refer him to section 38 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, which is set out on page 39. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"An employee who has both the right conferred by section 33 and a corresponding right conferred by her contract of employment or otherwise may take advantage of whichever right is, in any particular respect, the more favourable."</p></blockquote>
That clearly emphasises the point that I made earlier: an employee and an employer can make an agreement that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 344</span>
is based on individual circumstances and the contractual arrangement that may exist. I have said nothing new. That provision has existed for a long time, and is unamended by the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept part of what the Minister says. However, contractual rights are relevant only to some women. Women who are outside such arrangements will be caught by the 11-week rule, which seems arbitrary and may not suit their individual circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady. From listening to the debate, the Opposition played on the question of whether a person who was important to a company would be deemed to have started maternity leave if she had a day off for pregnancy-related illness. I was trying to assure the hon. Lady and her hon. Friends that diat is not the case in such circumstances. The hon. Lady talks about a more wider area; I was addressing the more sperific point made by her hon. Friends.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am again grateful to the Minister. Is not it possible that a woman might still be felt to be valuable to a company, but may not be covered by the situation described on page 39 line 9, which the Minister quoted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is something on which the employer and employee could come to an agreement. As I said, one of the reasbns why we have used the 11-week period is because we could not anticipate introducing a period of time that would diminish what is already there—I say that in all sincerity to the hon. Lady. The 11th week, for which the absence can start, is already an important point. I accept the concerns that have been raised, but I think that the way in which the wording is at the moment is preferable to the Opposition's amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to delay the Committee on this particular matter, but the phrase in the amendment, "stops" work is used in the statutory maternity pay regulations and therefore it is something with which the Government are familiar. It is a far more satisfactory formulation because it would cover all women who are covered by the Bill. The Minister says that employers and employees can come to an agreement, which can override the Bill, but that does not apply to all women.<br><br>
It would be far more sensible for the Government to take the wording of the amendment, which already exists in Government legislation, and not handicap some women and employers who might, unjustifiably, fall foul of the rule.<br><br>
There seems to be a dreadful silence. I hope that diat means that the Minister has accepted the logic of our arguments and will not oppose the amendment. I must press our amendment to a vote because of the reasons given by my hon. Friends.</span></p>
