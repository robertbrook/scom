	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has not moved that amendment, so she cannot withdraw it. We therefore come next to amendment No. 50.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 42, in page 24, line 6, leave out "increase" and insert "alter".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the amendments is to reduce the severe financial penalties which are envisaged for unions when they refuse to admit someone who seeks to join their union. If the person is refused entry for a reason which is not permitted under the clause, he may claim financial compensation under the terms of the clause. It is peculiar that the compensation which can be awarded, according to the clause, is similar to that awarded to someone claiming unfair dismissal against an employer. Why does the Minister feel that the so-called crime of being refused entry to a union, for a reason which does not come under the terms of the clause, can be equated with the devastating blow of losing a job altogether?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is another case of the punishment being out of line with the offence. As we have shown in earlier discussions on the clause, we feel that there may be reasons why a union may not wish to admit to someone, even though the clause and Bill fail to recognise that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial penalties and the qualifying time period could be said to mean that trade unions are being treated more harshly than employers who have unjustly dismissed someone. It is scandalous that in order to have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>136</span>
any protection against unfair dismissal, one has to have worked for the same employer for two years full-time, or five years part-time. The Minister shakes his head. I look forward to his reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can refer the Minister to one of the most devastating reports to be issued in recent times, that of the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, entitled "Hard Labour", which gives many examples of how people were dismissed by their employer without any right of redress whatsoever, sometimes simply for contacting a union or the factory inspectorate because of the disgraceful conditions in which they were expected to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that that is not the case and that those people have redress, but the report of the Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux gives many examples of how people who have worked with their employer for fewer than two years' full-time have no redress whatsoever and can be dismissed without any come-back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for the opportunity to put the matter straight. The reason I shook my head was because she made a general point about the two-year rule. In cases of discrimination on grounds of race or sex, the two-year rule does not apply. The hon. Lady made specific point about reporting matters of safety. There is an extension in the Bill for ordinary members of the work force, providing for protection and the right to claim unfair dismissal if they face action where they have taken action themselves in the face of imminent danger.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's point, but I maintain nevertheless that it is scandalous, when there are so many opportunities open to an employer who wants to dismiss an employee, that he should be able to do so without any comeback whatsoever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has dealt with only a small proportion of the cases that have been highlighted by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. It gives many heart-rending examples of how people have lost their jobs entirely unfairly and yet they have not been able to claim any compensation because they do not fall within the terms of the law on unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would have been wise to use the Bill to tighten all the loopholes referred to by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, rather than tackle the subject in this grudging and half-hearted way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be ruled out of order if I continued with this argument, but it is still necessary to raise these matters. In the Bill, the Government equate the financial penalty of being excluded from a union with the financial penalty awarded against employers who unfairly dismiss their employees. That is completely unfair to the unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unions are given only a short time to comply with the terms of the Bill when deciding whether to accept or exclude someone. By contrast, employers, often paying low wages and forcing people to work in very bad conditions, are allowed generous periods before becoming liable for unfair dismissal cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must consider this very seriously. In reply, can he tell us how the financial formula was arrived at
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
and whether or not he has had any representations either from unions or other organisations about this?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We spoke in earlier debates about the seriousness with which the Government view the issue of an individual's freedom to join the trade union of his or her choice. I will not go over that again. Let me just make one point, which seems to me to be the key to the discussion on the hon. Lady's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unions are not being held to ransom for the sums under debate here. Money is not being extracted from them with menaces. We are discussing the penalties which would be imposed when a trade union breaches the law by denying its actual or potential members a basic individual right. There is a simple remedy if trade unions do not want to pay this price: they should comply with the law and observe the rights of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady spoke about the nature and scale of the penalty. We believe that the penalties for refusing to comply with the provisions of the clause should be sufficient genuinely to deter a trade union from excluding or expelling an individual from membership in breach of the new provision. We believe that the penalties in the clause as drafted do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The maximum award provisions are also entirely logical and consistent. They match the maximum award criteria in virtually all other similar provisions in employment legislation—in all unfair dismissal cases, as the hon. Lady pointed out. They are neither more lenient nor more harsh than those in comparable legislation—nor should they be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am slightly distressed to see the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin), who is normally very reasonable, trying to make it less financially punishing for a trade union to break the proposed new law. There can be no other reason behind the amendment. The amendments also propose to remove the minimum award that an employment appeal tribunal can make. It is hard to understand the motive for such a proposal unless it is to remove the incentive for unions to comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision applies only to cases heard by the employment appeals tribunal. It only comes into play in cases when an industrial tribunal has already found that the complainant was excluded or expelled in breach of the Act and the trade union still refuses to admit that person into membership. Surely Opposition Members are not seriously suggesting that there should not be at least some kind of potential further penalty for a trade union that has been found in breach of the law but still refuses to put right the wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Nicholls 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would a union be entitled to say that it was permissibly relying on conduct to exclude a person if that person were a member of a political party and the union had provided that members of that party were not allowed to join the union? From my understanding of the clause I think that that might be so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill defines conduct as possible grounds for excluding individuals from becoming trade union members. My hon. Friend will see that there are provisions in the Bill that exclude from conduct membership, for example, of another union. He is,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
however, right to draw attention to the fact that, in theory at least, it could be argued that membership of a political organisation might be a reason to exclude someone from membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals with the Bridlington rules, which is why the exclusions from conduct are drafted in these terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of my hon. Friends and I would be troubled if the Bill could be interpreted so that conduct could amount to membership of a political party. I only noticed that aspect of Bill's provisions last night. Will the Minister perhaps come back on Report on that particular undertaking?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is evidence of people being excluded from trade union membership in line with the Bridlington rules, but I am unaware of examples of people being excluded from membership because of their membership of a political party. I think that one union used to exclude members of the Communist party—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From holding office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether it still does. There was a celebrated case in the 1950s involving that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister would condemn such a case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be support on both sides of the Committee for the idea that I should consider the matter further, and I am happy to give my hon. Friend for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) an undertaking to do so. I shall consider whether it is necessary to redraft the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the limits on compensation should be subject to "alteration" rather than "increase" by order. Why? The only result would be to ensure that, in future, the Government could reduce the compensation offered to an individual who, through no fault of his own, had been excluded or expelled from a trade union. Is the suggestion that, at some future point, that will become less important or less of an outrage to the personal freedom of individual trade union members? I reject that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are and always shall be committed to freedom of choice for trade union members and we shall provide whatever penalties are necessary to stop trade unions riding roughshod over the wishes of individuals. For those reasons I ask the hon. Member for Gateshead, East to withdraw the amendment and, if she will not, I ask the Committee to reject it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady asked me about the representations that have been made to us on the matter. I hope that having listened to what I have said, she can see the golden thread of logic shining through the Bill. We have not received representations on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to what the Minister said. The thread of logic, such as it is—I would not call it golden, and my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) suggested that it was fools' gold—is simply that the Government will penalise trade unions as much as they think they can get away with, while doing little to penalise employers who unfairly dismiss people.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
I was interested in what the hon. Member for Teignbridge said, although I think that he must have missed some of our earlier discussions because we considered these issues during discussions of the Bridlington rules. I am unsure which political party he was taking to task: his party, the Labour party, the Communist party or the National Front, all of which would presumably fall within the relevant category.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One can probably distinguish between a political party and a conspiracy against public interest. I was making the point that many people would find it offensive that a mainstream political party member—for those purposes, I include the Labour party—might be excluded from membership of a trade union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows well that trade unions have members from all mainstream political parties. He is worrying about a problem that does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still unhappy with the way in which the Minister is dealing with this part of the Bill. It is unjustified to equate exclusion from a trade union for any reason that does not happen to fall within the narrow criteria of the Bill with unfair dismissal. The Minister said that the law on unfair dismissal had been improved. Will he confirm, therefore, whether someone who works full-time for an employer who imposes harsh conditions could be dismissed simply for contacting a citizens advice bureau? The Minister says nothing, so I assume that that is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would depend on the circumstances of the case and the nature of the complaint made to the citizens advice bureau. If the hon. Lady is suggesting that, in general, part-time workers need to have been employed for more than four years to acquire the right to take an action for unfair dismissal to a tribunal, that is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes the point. I am sure that we shall return to that issue many times because a great number of injustices in the labour market are arising from lack of protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not accept what the Minister has said, I shall not press the amendment to a vote. Because I believe that the objections that we have raised in connection with the amendment are similar to those that we have raised about the whole clause, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"as far as is reasonably practicable."</p></q>
Contrary to what some people say, the rules of order are usually conducive to the expeditious conduct of business—although were we able to have a clause stand part debate before we debated the amendments to the clause, we might avoid a considerable amount of repetition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the amendment is that the Opposition believe that it is unreasonable to impose an absolute duty on the employer. We think that it would be better from the employer's point of view—and I am sure that most of them would agree—if the words "as far as is reasonably practicable" were added. Those words would ease the employer's burden a little.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I comment on what the hon. Gentleman said at the beginning of his speech? If he is anxious to get on to the clause stand part debate, he need not move the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to respond to the amendment, which seems to be based on a misunderstanding. The clause substitutes for section 68 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 new sections 68 and 68A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 68(1) of the 1992 Act gives a union member who has certified to his employer that his union membership has been or, from a particular date, will be, terminated, a right to stop deductions from his pay for union subscriptions. Section 68(2) specifies that:
	<br><q><p>"The employer's duty under subsection (1) applies from the first day, following the giving of the certificate, on which it is reasonably practicable for him to comply with that subsection."</p></q>
The considerations which apply to section 68 of the 1992 Act do not apply to the circumstances covered by the new section 68(1). It is reasonable to allow an employer who is already making reductions a certain period of time to act on a notification to cease making those deductions but it does not make sense to apply the test of reasonable practicability when individual authority is required for the first time. In cases in which such circumstances apply, they have been taken account of—that concerns new section 68 (3)(b), which deals with circumstances in which a worker withdraws his authorisation to check-off deductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Practical issues are involved. The employer who is already making deductions has no way of knowing, until he receives notification, that the employee intends to withdraw from check-off. It is right and proper that the employer has time to make the necessary adjustments and that the condition of reasonable practicability can apply. I hope, on that basis, that the hon. Gentleman is absolutely clear about the subject and will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 25, line 22, after "amount", insert
	<br><q><p>"(or for subscriptions based on a percentage of pay, the rate)".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 52, in page 26, line 20, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(6) The union shall—
	<ol>
	<li>send the appropriate notice to every member of the union to whom it is reasonably practicable to send such notice; or</li>
	<li>take all such other steps for bringing the appropriate notice to the attention of the members of the union (whether by publishing the notice or otherwise) as is the practice of the union to take when matters of general interest to all its members need to be brought to their attention,</li></ol>
save that notice shall not be required where any increase in the amount of subscription deduction is due to a change in the worker's wages.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might discuss this matter at greater length. Amendment No. 62 would cope with trade unions that do not set a particular membership fee but which give all members on a certain level of pay an obligation to contribute in accordance with a banding arrangement similar to that of the council tax. I am tempted to commend that to Conservative Members—although I am not sure that this is the best way to go about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some unions might decide that if a person is earning £15,000 a year a certain amount of that would go to the union. If a person were paid £20,000 a year, a different amount would be paid. We do not believe that special notification should be required when people who have joined a union knowing that the banding system exists go through various thresholds which increase their subscription. That is inconsistent with the other arrangement. We accept, however, that if the bands are changed by a union, its members should be notified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some trade unions, members pay a standard consistent percentage of their salary, whatever that salary may be. They may, for example, pay 1 per cent. 2 per cent or 3 per cent. I do not know whether the wording of the amendment achieves what it intends, but conceding the principle of the amendment would not breach the Government's objectives and it would not be inconsistent with the clause. The amendment would give these trade union members what the clause intends to give others. If the union wants to raise the percentage paid from 1 to 1.5 per cent or from 1.5 to 2 per cent. we accept that notification will be necessary. The amendment would alleviate much botheration without breaching the principle of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 52 would oblige a trade union to notify its members of an increase in subscriptions, be it an increase in the sum, in the banding or in the percentage which members pay. A considerable number of unions already do that, and it should be recognised that there is not one trade union rule book which allows an increase in subscriptions without the consent of the members, through the usual consultation, election and conference decision-making processes. In present circumstances,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>142</span>
there can be few union members in possession of their senses who are unaware of an increase in union subscription.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussion at branches, newsletters, articles in journals, arguments, the fact that union conferences are taking place where people have to be elected to represent members in the workplace—all these factors mean that union members are usually well aware of the fact that it is intended to increase their subscriptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most people are aware of any changes to their payslips. It is a matter to which large numbers of people pay very close attention. Informing people is union practice, but it is not required by law, and we accept the principle that it is reasonable legally to require members to be informed. But we believe that that is best done by "the usual channels"—a principle that the Government have agreed to incorporate elsewhere in the Bill by means of an amendment. The same could be done to this clause, to the benefit of all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not the Minister accepts their wording, I hope that he will accept the principles behind amendments Nos. 62 and 52.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have had a number of representations from trade unions on the question of the difficulties that will be caused when flat rate percentages of salary apply to subscriptions and employers are required to notify each increase in subscriptions arising from a salary increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having urged the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment to enable us to proceed to stand part, I am now pleased that he did not take my advice, because he has a sensible point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend, the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. McLoughlin) is becoming alarmed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So am I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is not right, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged, in its drafting, but it is right in the substance. I am happy to accept the principle enshrined in the amendment and to give a commitment to the Committee to move a suitable amendment on Report; it will result in employers not having to notify increases in subscriptions which arise purely because of changes in salary levels where there is a flat rate percentage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be clear, however, that if the flat rate percentage is increased, there is a duty to notify members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having pleased the hon. Gentleman in respect of his first amendment, I have to disappoint him in respect of his second. The duty is put upon the employer, where an employer agrees to operate a check-off, to make deductions from members' salaries. It is important that the duty to inform them remains with the employer. However, it would be good practice for unions to inform their members in advance about subscription increases. Both the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge can thus have their way.

I cannot accept the second amendment, but I am happy to accede to the hon. Gentleman's request in respect of the first amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said before that there is no question of an employer checking off from anyone's wages or salary a union subscription without his consent. Our belief, which is shared by the Confederation of British Industry, is that such a law already applies. Trade union members should be notified of increases in trade union subscriptions, we believe that that practice already applies. If the Government insist that trade union members be notified from time to time that they may withdraw from the arrangement, that is fair enough, but it might be a good idea if employers were also obliged to inform union members that they were happy to continue the arrangement—presumably they are, if they continue to have it on offer. We also accept that if a trade union member is paying by check-off, he should be free to withdraw from that arrangement and pay the subscription to a collector. We understand that that happens already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are happy to have clarification. We accept that there may be problems with the existing law—it was introduced by the Conservative Government—and that it is not as clear as it should be in respect of the four principles to which I have referred. But the requirement to which schedule 8 refers, of an initial agreement with three-yearly renewal, is wholly unreasonable, grotesquely bureaucratic and inconvenient. From the point of view of Conservative Members, it is more grotesquely bureaucratic and inconvenient for employers than for trade unions, because the obligation is placed on the employer, not the trade union. The employer would be breaking the law if he failed to organise the initial re-signing on and the three-yearly renewals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that everyone in the Room knows that the Government initially proposed annual renewals. In response to the Green Paper proposing that, virtually every employer and employers organisation which responded said, "Oh my God, no!"—or words to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"If there is to be compulsory renewal, it should be at much greater intervals." The Confederation of British Industry believes that five-yearly renewal is frequent enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
We are faced with four propositions ranging across the spectrum—I said "spectrum" not "spectre"—from the annual renewal suggested by the hon. Member for Teignbridge, to the Government's three-yearly renewal; from the CBI's reluctantly tolerated five-yearly renewal—I gather that moves may be afoot to suggest that there be no renewal requirement at all—to the Opposition's view that there should be no renewal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should deductions for trade union subscriptions be treated differently from other deductions from people's pay, some of which are encouraged by the Government? Contributions to charities are sometimes paid by check-off. We do not suggest that those should be renewable—I hope that the Government do not either. Contributions to sports and social clubs whose subscriptions increase from time to time are often paid by check-off, but the Government do not think that there should be any special provision for them. The special provisions are directed only at trade union subscriptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We live in a world from which this type of notification is rapidly disappearing. Many people pay bills by direct debit which authorises payment at current levels as well as at subsequent higher levels, to the building society, the gas company, the electricity company, the telephone company or Access. There is no requirement for further authorisation. Once a direct debit slip has been signed, unless someone signs off, he is on it for life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are growing accustomed to this practice and have been accustomed to it in terms of wages law. On the whole, problems have not arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told, and I am prepared to believe it, that there has been skulduggery in the building industry. Unless I misunderstood what the Minister said on Second Reading, the skulduggery involved money which moved from an employer to somebody purporting to be a member of the Union of Construction Allied Trades and Technicians. Nobody was clear where the money had come from or to whom it went or for what purpose. It is not clear that that had anything to do with check-off, and it is rumoured that building workers in one of those incidents were rather surprised to discover that they were members of the union at all. They were not complaining about check-off without authority. The employer had simply handed over a lump sum to one of the building trade unions in lieu of collecting the subscriptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unlawful for an employer to give money away to a trade union without let or hindrance if he claims that the money is union subscriptions. It might be slightly fraudulent, although I am not sure whom the employer would be defrauding. It is unlawful only if the money is stopped from people's wages without their consent; but there are no examples of that. However, if it happened, the law would not need to be changed because it is a criminal offence committed by—I emphasise this—the employer, not the trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is not to change the law but to apply it and to get PC Plod to go round, get somebody in the dock and prosecute. If the employer has been stealing money from people's wages, send him to jail or make him suffer a heavy fine. The law provides for that, and it should be applied. The Government should not be asking Parliament to change a law which everybody, except the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>145</span>
Government, agrees is adequate but not enforced. The Government have our support for enforcing the law on anyone who is deducting money from pay packets without consent. I think I can reasonably say that that would have been approved by every parliamentary Labour party. The objection to employers stopping money without authority is almost a fundamental part of the labour movement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not support dragging in this total irrelevance. The clause would not deal with the skulduggery about which the Government say they are concerned. It would still be possible to break the law—it is happening now. Every reputable employer would bear an enormous bureaucratic burden just to sort out a problem which could be solved by prosecuting existing and apparently known offenders. If the Government do not know of any offenders, they have still less reason to change the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that I asked in paraliamentary questions and in debate for the Government to produce evidence of companies which were unlawfully checking-off union subscriptions without the consent of those whose money was being taken. The parliamentary answer confirmed that the Department had not examined those allegations because that was not its job. The odd example may occur by accident; an employer assumes that of 36 people working in part of the company, 35 are union members. After a couple of weeks or months, the non-member has the check-off taken away. That is an accident, it is drawn to the attention of the employer and it is put right. People are entitled not to have this money checked-off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three-year renewal would impose a heavy bureaucratic burden on employers. An employer with a computerised payroll—I guess that many have them—would need to feed into that a system which would enable the company to be reminded a few months before the third anniversary of a person signing the authority for the money to be deducted, that the anniversary is due.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trade union and individual member will also have to be notified. The company will have to check that the union member wants to continue to have the check-off. If the company receives no response, it will probably follow up that notification and reminder. It may also request that the union follows up the matter with the member and may have to tell the union which members have responded and which have not responded to the first, second or even third reminder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the absence of a renewal, the company will want to strike the person off the register of those employees who are logged as paying union subs in such a way. That may be all fine and dandy, but there is quite a bit of inertia around. It is not the vexatious litigant but the inert member—if I may use such a phrase—who poses the greatest problem for the employer. Perhaps the inert member does not want to cease being a member of the union. However, it is a general requirement of union members to pay in full their union subscriptions. If these inert members take no action, are unintentionally struck from the register of members by the employer and then have an accident, or experience a change in circumstances which leaves them out of benefit, they will be out of sorts with the employer if they find that, as a result of this legislation, they do not get the extra sick pay, or help with the accident case that they had expected. Many of their fellow members, who might have mocked them had they
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>146</span>
stopped paying their subs, would be sympathetic towards them and unsympathetic towards their employer if they were left out of benefit as a result of that payroll rigmarole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers with large payrolls to whom I have talked are horrified at the prospect of carrying out that bureaucratic task. They have suggested there are pros and cons to the idea—a big-bang version of renewal. Each year, the employer, or whoever it may be, would decide a date in a financial, calendar, company or trade union year—we do not know which—on which all authorisations could be renewed by means of a once-a-year, big-bang renewal arrangement. There is some merit in that idea. It is less likely that people will be unaware of the renewal date and ignore the letters that they may receive from their employer or trade union. Some attention will be paid to the arrangements, and the response rate may be better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, employers can do without the problem of having to contemplate which is the best day of the year for them, whether to consult the union or their employers' association and whether the union at their plant will want to consult the national union. The company's management will probably think it is all a pain in the neck. It could lead to a wrangle between the union, the employees and the employer about which is the best date, but eventually someone will have to decide which is the best date for one-off renewal for 1996 and for 1997. Therefore, the Bill should include some provision for a warning period so that everyone will know which is the relevant day and can prepare for it. The problem of the inert member, though, may be more acute than it would be under the constant renewal process. I shall explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is likely that large numbers of people will renew and that a few will decide not to, but that still leaves the non-repliers—the no-show, in airline terminology. If the no-show inerts do not reply and if a Mr. Iain Mills—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not an inert member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. But let us suppose that there was a member of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical union at an engineering works in the midlands who was called Iain Mills but who, unlike the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills), was an inert member who had not bothered to reply. Let us also suppose that the inert Iain Mills' renewal date—the real third anniversary of his signing on—was 1 December 1997 but that the employer—possibly in consultation with the union—had decided that the once-a-year day for that plant was 1 April. What would be the status of his membership and what would be his authority to have money deducted if he did not reply by 1 April because his original authorisation did not run out until the end of December? Whatever the law, it is another pain for the employer because, on 1 April, he has three categories of employees: those who have renewed, those who have said that they do not want to renew—who fall into two categories, but I shall come to that—and those who have said nothing. From 1 April until the original authority for the deduction has expired, it is unclear whether deductions can continue to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, let us suppose that the inert Mr. Iain Mills has not replied and that his employer has informed the union that he no longer has the authority to make deductions and stops collecting the money from 1 April. What would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
be the position if Mr. Iain Mills had an accident and turned to the union for help in fighting an industrial accident case or tried to obtain industrial injury benefit, to which members of trade unions are entitled? Would that person be out of benefit because for the last six months the union had received no subscription? There are many other problems, but I am drawing attention to problems that individual members of trade unions, not the trade unions themselves, and their employers will face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to consider this matter at a time when the Government rightly say that we need to keep the bureaucratic burdens on employers to a minimum. I commend the excellent speech of the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) to this effect during an Adjournment debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quite apart from the hon. Gentleman's charming reference to this hypothetical person, I have been trying to follow the leaden chain of his logic. The Gentleman is labouring this point. If anyone is a member of a union, surely he would take the trouble, particularly if money is involved. I question whether there are any inert members, whatever their names. Certainly anybody of that name in the west midlands in the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical union would be a lively and much loved member of the union. What percentage of trade unionists would be in that category?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea, nor has the Minister. The hon. Member for Meriden says that I am labouring the point, but it will be a laborious process for employers. That is why I am labouring the point. For the people running the payroll and personnel office in this mythical company in the midlands, the number hardly matters. Two or three would be a flaming nuisance. Admittedly, a few hundred would be a bigger nuisance. Nevertheless, a limited number of individuals, falling into the categories I have described, would be a real pain for the employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Gateshead, East must not read a newspaper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In fairness, my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee what he advocates? Does his think that there should be an opportunity for an employer to deal with all renewals on a certain date over the period of the next 12 months, or does he argue that the opportunity should not be there because it would not be practical? I am not clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am saying is that first of all the whole proposition is impractical, laborious and bureaucratic and is likely to impose costs on many good employers. That is the last thing we want to do. I know that the Minister and his officials have received representations from other organisations, as well as from us, about the possibility of substituting the big-bang, one-off, once a year proposition. To permit that might be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
On balance, I am probably in favour of making it clear in law that the rolling renewal and the big-bang renewal are alternatives, if the Government persist in changing the law. I am drawing attention to the fact that massive problems seem to arise for the employer, whichever road is taken. The once a year renewal was chosen because it appeared to be simpler. It does appear simpler at the outset and might be a little simpler, but it is not simple and is certainly not as good as not changing the law at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will have to come up with some pretty good explanations about why the Government are insisting on renewal, be it three-yearly or annual. Renewal does not deal with the problem that the Government say that they have identified. If people were prosecuted, we believe that the present law would deal with that problem. If it does not, amendments should be introduced. We do not think that the rest of British industry should be burdened with these provisions. I suspect that Conservative Members know that many employers regard the provisions as a right old burden because they have received representations about them. I hope that the Minister will reconsider, because the issue is important. The renewal provisions seem to us to do more harm than they are worth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has advanced two reasons against the proposition. One concerns trade union members, which I understand; the other concerns the burdens which would be imposed on business. Having been something of a devotee of employment Bills and trade unions reform Bills for more than five years, I find his concern regarding the bureaucratic burdens imposed on employers about the most implausible argument that I have ever heard from the Opposition Front Bench.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has expressed his views about wide sections of the employer community on several occasions in a most ungracious and trenchant way. The idea that he has come here today as a shining Sir Galahad to defend the employer community against bureaucratic burdens should be treated with the contempt that it deserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras is concerned about the burden imposed on the trade union movement by inactive members. I understand his fear. If trade union members are so unenamoured of the benefits provided to them that they become inert, that is hardly the fault of the Government, or of the legislation. It is for the trade unions, as for any other organisation, to ensure that what they are offering their membership is sufficiently attractive to members that they become enthusiastic instead of inert.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the idea that employers are, in some way, burdened, we should not lose sight of the fact that the employer has a choice about whether to enter into a check-off arrangement. He is not compelled to do so. He can decide whether to operate such a system. It is not for me, although I could be tempted, to state rules or ideas which might make an employer decide whether to operate such a system. If he is prepared to do it, and to do so voluntarily, it seems to me that certain consequences flow from that and that the employers should conduct the operation in an acceptable and democratic manner. That is what all this is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with a fixed period is that it is arbitrary. Ultimately, it is impossible to say that one year would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
correct, that 18 years would be bad and that six months would be worse. There is some logic in having a time limit. I thought, obviously optimistically, that there would be common ground on both sides of the Committee that once authorisation had been given it should not be allowed to apply for ever and a day. It is such a common-sense proposition that I am surprised that it has been challenged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Spellar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder why the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The uniqueness of trade unions is in their relationship vis-à-vis employers and the laws of tort.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Insofar as they retain particular immunities in the law of tort, it is because, rightly or wrongly, Parliament still accepts that they should have those immunities because they are a unique institution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter, it seems, will divide the Committee. I see nothing improbable in requiring that, at some stage, the check-off is confirmed. The problem is when that is done. The original Green Paper was straightforward in stating that the right time for reaffirmation would be 12 months. Looked at in a rigorous and logical way, one could say that it should be monthly or quarterly, depending on how the person was paid. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i> That is where logic may yet take us. It would impose bureaucratic obligations on the employer community and Conservative Members could complain about that with a degree of plausibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Twelve months is clearly the right time because people tend to review their financial obligations on a yearly basis. One takes stock after a year to consider one's expenses. There is a logic to stating 12 months. There is no justification for the Government to move from their position in the original Green Paper—that one year would be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that the employer community favours five years. Well, it would. What is obvious from the debates over the years is the extent to which a certain type of employer will complain about trade union practices and then work hand-in-glove with the trade union movement, to the employer's own advantage. The position was put extremely well as long ago as November 1987 by the then general secretary of what is now the GMB in the Jim Conway lecture. He said that:
	<br><q><p>"Persuading individuals to join a union is hard work, so perhaps we should not be surprised that some union officials have resorted to an easier option.</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
	<br><q><p>Why waste effort on trying to entice individual workers to join, when a well judged deal with a friendly employer can deliver lots of fee paying members, nicely wrapped up in computer tape?"</p></q>
The idea that it is difficult to persuade people to join trade unions could be replaced by the idea that, according to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, at times it is pretty hard to persuade them to stay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether it is trade unions or employers that say that a person should reaffirm only twice a decade that they want the deductions to be made, the message is clear: "What those chaps ought to do is pay-up and not worry about reaffirming. We will take the money; there is no need to review it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be surprised if this team of Ministers, confronted by the logic of their own position in the Green Paper, switched over to three or five years merely because the employer community thinks that that would be a good idea. When it comes to protecting the rights of trade union members, the employer community does not work in the way that one expects.

It will be a great pity if my hon. Friend the Minister has been briefed, in the event of a dispute, to split this down the middle. That is the practice of the civil service through the ages. It would be a great shame for this Minister if the tiger of wrath were brought low by the warthogs of administration!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Follow that! The hon. Member for Teignbridge has spent too long in the sun. I never thought that I would say this, but I appreciate the fact that these Ministers are not the previous Ministers. Some off-the-wall ideas are certainly being bounced about by Conservative Ministers. On this occasion, the hon. Member for Teignbridge has made other Tory Members look perfectly reasonable and sensible—a hard task in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. He talked eminent sense both in terms of the rights of trade union members and employers, and the ability of employers to entertain a sensible system of association with trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It concerns me that the legislation being imposed is setting trade unions apart from other parts of our community. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has raised this point already. I worked for nine years for a variety of trade unions and charities; the latter are similar to trade unions in respect of the check-off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the few things that I welcomed during the 1980s was the fact that the payroll-giving scheme enabled many employees to give money to charities, through check-off, and with few problems. The fact that charities can have a system of voluntary agreement between an employer, an employee and a third party—in this case, the charity—resembles the fact that an employee, an employer and a third party—in this case, the trade union—can agree a similar form of check-off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my experience of working for charities, both as employee and director, and of being a member of a trade union, I can say that there is no difference in principle

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>151</span>
between a payroll-giving deduction to a charity, and a trade union subscription to a trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have been alarmed if the Government had proposed renewals for payroll-giving schemes. It is obvious to anybody in the charitable sector that if, after a three-year period, payroll-giving has to be renewed, there will be a natural drop-off of perhaps hundreds of people, probably simply through laziness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be uncharitable to accuse the Government of introducing the clause on the grounds that they wish to see a drop-off in trade union membership, but undoubtedly that will follow if people fail to renew their subscriptions. The same applies to the payroll-giving scheme, and I do not understand why the Government will not introduce legislation to make that renewal after three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman reminds me of several contracts to which I am a party. I use a broker to deal with my car insurance. Every year the broker writes to me telling me what the premium will be and reminds me that I can go elsewhere or ask him to look for more favourable terms; I have the choice to decide whether to stay or to go elsewhere. Similarly, I am a member of the RAC and I pay by direct debit. The RAC could simply collect the direct debit. But every year it writes to me and gives me the option of having that direct debit collected as usual or deciding not to. I do not know why the hon. Gentleman thinks that the provision is unique. There are many examples, especially in commerce, of similar systems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady gave two examples. I can quote more ordinary examples—electricity bills, telephone bills, mobile telephone bills, charity donations, Co-op social club subscription. All those agreements were made because it was administratively more convenient for me to make a one-off agreement to be revoked by one side or the other at any time without the sponsoring organisation having to return to me. I pay my telephone bill by direct debit and no one comes back to me. I have agreed in principle to pay by direct debit and there is no compunction on the company to obtain further authorisation from me. For both the company and me, it is administratively more straight forward to have a one-off agreement with the onus on me as the customer to withdraw the authorisation if I wish to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras said that employers are concerned about the matter and he summed up the case admirably. The Engineering Employers Federation described the measure as
	<br><q><p>"an unnecessary administrative nightmare without any commensurate benefit."</p></q>
The British Institute of Management echoed that view and said that it
	<br><q><p>"will lead to administrative burdens on employers."</p></q>
The Institute of Personnel Management also commented and said:
	<br><q><p>"there has been no groundswell of support from our members for change in the check-off procedures."</p></q>
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce said:
	<br><q><p>"Many Chambers have difficulty in seeing what advantage this proposal has for employers".</p></q>

I took the opportunity last Friday, when addressing a business lunch in my constituency, to ask some of the major employers—that is, employers with 200 or 300 employees—what they thought about the proposal to require renewal of the check-off system. There was universal horror at the administrative difficulties that my hon. Friend outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen when trade union members do not renew and there is single-union agreement? Employers will have to keep reminding union members if they fall through the net of the check-off system and do not renew their subscriptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that employees remain members of trade unions simply because of the inertia created by the check-off system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not at all. People join trade unions for a variety of reasons, usually positive. If the check-off must be renewed, union members will have to re-subscribe to check-off. They will still want to be members of trade unions. The check-off facility is an administrative procedure that makes things easier for members and other employees. Major employers in my constituency and the organisations that I have referred to today have welcomed it. Those organisations oppose the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not easy for trade unions and employees to examine the clause and decide whether it is damaging. It is easier to say that the check-off is positive. If people volunteer to use it, there are safeguards in legislation to protect them. I do not understand why the Government want to introduce the measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras regarding the big bang theory. If the Government persist with the clause and want a renewal of check-off, I and many of my constituents would want it to be renewed once a year. It makes no sense to have a programme, day in, day out, week in, week out, of checking when employees joined, when their check-off renewals are due, and when they are notified by employers. The big bang suggestion would be much more administratively sensible if the Government persisted with the check-off renewal proposals. I hope that, if the Minister is not going to change the clause, he will at least consider that suggestion and see whether it could be used to make the system more beneficial to employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sum up my objections by asking why we are treating unions differently from charities, of which I have great experience, from voluntary agencies such as social clubs and other institutions associated with work and from direct debit facilities. Why are further administrative burdens being imposed on employers when there is no demand for them from employers? Why are the Government persisting with the proposals? I can only think that their ultimate objective is to reduce trade union membership by pushing people into inertia and by making it harder to join trade unions. I hope that the Government will come clean if that is the case, but I suspect that they will not. I urge hon. Members to support the amendment and to reject the Government's attempt to meddle with administrative matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

and St Pancras? I find it hard to support any of the amendments. They should not exist because the clause should not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was secretary of a union branch that contained more than 1,000 members, out of whom possibly 400 paid their union contributions through check-off. Those 400 members were spread around seven or eight companies. They knew what contributions they paid and that those contributions went to the branch. A thread runs between the member, the trade union and the union branch. Once that thread is cut, there could be difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) referred to other forms of regular payment, such as for telephone bills and Access. Conservative Members missed the point when we discussed how trade union members are advised on every occasion when contributions are increased. Members are also advised that they pay through check-off. It is not as though they have signed a document authorising their union contributions to be stopped out of their wages and then receive no more communications for 10, 15 or 20 years. They are notified each year that that authorisation can be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason for this clause. Looking at it logically, new subsection (2) could negate new subsection (b). A trade union member can agree one week to his contributions being deducted from his pay, yet the next week he can authorise their not being stopped from his wages. When I was a branch secretary, many of my members chose deliberately not to have their union contributions deducted from their wages. They wanted to attend the branch meetings and pay their contributions then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Complete freedom exists at present. On the one hand, a member's contributions can be deducted from his pay yet, on the other hand, he can easily have them not deducted. The clause will not assist the trade union member, nor will it assist the employer. Ultimately, it will be the employer's responsibility to check whether the union members still require their union subs to be stopped from their wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, we have unearthed during today's debate another vexatious person who wants to cut the golden thread—the hon. Member for Teignbridge. The Minister should consider the matter in some depth and think about deleting the clause. It will not assist anyone who wishes to encourage the good working relationship between trades unions and employers which all members of the Committee would surely support. The clause is a needless, meddling piece of bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>154</span>
clear some of the problems that will arise as a result of the clause. The present system is no more than an efficient, cost effective way in which to collect trade union subscriptions. It enables employers to say that enrolment in check-off is the responsibility of the individual member and his union. In that way, employers can keep out of the dispute. If the clause results in a rolling renewal or in a big-bang renewal once a year, major problems will arise which will sometimes draw the employer into disputes between a member and his union. Employers do not want to be involved in such disputes. One must suspect that the real reason for the clause is to discourage employers from entering into check-off agreements. The hon. Member for Teignbridge made that clear. It is a revolutionary view of society and an absolute refusal to accept that there should be co-operation between trade unions and employers. From what was said, it was plain that that was the attitude—trade unions and employers should not co-operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would impose such bureaucratic nonsense on the system of check-off as to prevent check-off arrangements from being sustainable, thereby ending them. The Government should accept the logic of our case and allow the employers to keep out of possible disputes. If the Government are not willing to withdraw the clause and if they are not interested in ending check-off arrangements, they should take account of the views expressed by employers' organisations and extend the period to five years. That would be a reasonable time scale for the implementation of that burdensome, bureaucratic nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mills</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to have featured as the star turn of the morning, alongside the vexatious, capricious, moribund and inert. I have one question to put to the Minister. Is my understanding correct that if and when the clause is passed, there would be an absolute obligation on employers to follow this system, or is there to be some discretion? If, for example, the individual, the trade union and the employer all agreed on a different approach, could they legally carry it out, or must they obey the legislation to the letter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) in thanking the hon. Member for Teignbridge for his contribution, which let the cat out of the bag and explained the reason not only for the clause but for the fact that, so soon after the previous trade union legislation, we have more trade union legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that employers and workers will not behave in the way that the radical theorists believe they should behave. That is what happened in the case of industrial action ballots. The theory was that trade unionists never wanted to go into dispute; therefore, if only they were balloted, they would reject it every time. It did not work out that way, so endless restrictions were imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0433">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>155</span>
The same applies to check-off. In many cases employers want to co-operate and get on with running their businesses, instead of being subjected to endless arguments with their workers and trade unions. Unfortunately, they will not fit in with the plan. As a colleague of ours, Leif Mills, the general secretary of the banking union said on the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the brewers, the trouble with the brewing industry is that it works in practice but not in theory. We have seen the consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When an employee's money is taken away from him and donated to a trade union, should he not be able to reaffirm every now and again, or perhaps only every three years, that he wants his money to be taken away from him like that? To speak of the deduction of a worker's money as just bureaucratic nonsense is not very democratic, but perhaps that does not trouble the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But under existing legislation the employee has the right at any stage—it was said at every hour, but it could be at any hour—to put in a request for that deduction to cease. The Minister may say that under the previous legislation the employee can do that only by withdrawing from the union. He may want to withdraw from check-off but not from the union. That drafting could be tidied up. The principle already exists that the employee can write to the employer at any time and that it would be an offence for an employer to continue to make such deductions after having received the notification. What will this mean in practice? I sometimes feel that we are listening not to genuine Conservatives but to 19th century classic Liberals. They will not accept that people generally do not reply to letters. That is how bureaucracy comes into it. When people do not reply, the difficulties alluded to by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras occur. It is difficult to get people to reply. Even Access cannot get people to reply to five legal letters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman accuses my hon. Friend—accuse is the wrong word—he congratulates my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge on having 19th century Liberal aspirations. Does that apply to the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East, who said that he would accept the principle of reaffirmation and that he would accept it if it was five years? How does the hon. Gentleman account for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East, as a former shop steward in the trade union movement, knows that when faced with an obdurate employer, one sometimes has to settle for second best. He was dealing with the less unacceptable compromise. We are examining the basic principle and debating whether we want to place such bureaucratic burdens on unions and business. It should not be Government policy to create such burdens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A time limit was not included in the Conservative manifesto. The Conservative manifesto, given early this year to the electors, referred to ensuring that there was written affirmation to check-off. No one has argued about that yet. The hon. Member for Tatton made clear what criteria the Government are considering in relation to business regulation. He said:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
	<br><q><p>"That vast increase in complex legislation, no doubt much of it for desirable reasons, nevertheless demonstrates the increase in regulatory burdens that have been put upon businesses of all kinds."</p></q>
We have argued that. The hon. Gentleman continued:
	<br><q><p>"the burden of legislation and regulation is more than is absolutely necessary in order to provide the protection that, on other grounds, we think is appropriate."</p></q>
He then made an extremely relevant point.
	<br><q><p>"the costs that they impose must be proportionate to the benefits to the public at large."</p></q>>
The hon. Gentleman then said:
	<br><q><p>"we shall now require cost-compliance assessments, where appropriate, when new regulations are proposed."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 December 1992; Vol. 215, 	<i>c.</i> 668–9.]</p></q>
It might be interesting to know if any cost-compliance assessments were made for this legislation with regard to employers or trade unions. During the debate, Opposition Members have been unable to ascertain what protection the Government think is required and how the clause will provide it. Is the requirement for written authorisation? We believe that the Wages Act 1986 clearly identifies the need for written authorisation. It is clear from previous debates that when people sign their contract of employment there might be confusion as to whether they also sign up for check-off. As far as I am aware, there have been no examples of confusion among the practitioners—employers or trade unions. Such confusion if it exists, is easy to rectify. It is equally easy to rectify any confusion over the right to leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real question is whether there are cases of companies or individuals being unable to exercise their right to leave the union, or to withdraw from check-off. If there have been no such problems, are we not imposing an extremely vexatious burden? It is not our friend the vexatious litigant but a new creature, the vexatious legislator. Are we not creating a considerable burden for unions through sheer grinding, bureaucratic work which will take them away from their main job of representing their members in discussions with employers? Are we not also putting a burden on employers that might lead them to withdraw the check-off, or to avoid embarking upon it. We have not yet heard a real justification, apart from that given by the hon. Member for Teignbridge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Member for Meriden about the references to Mr. Mills. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will have some sympathy for me for having to sit for many hours in Committee hearing other hon. Members saying, "This is a considerable burden." Today, I have even greater problems. I do not mind being a considerable burden, but I have heard today of bureaucratic burdens. And my hon. Friends have just told me of a new invention—the vexatious burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That fact that 17 per cent of union members are covered by check-off is not the big deal that Conservative Members seem to wish to make it. Opposition Members have given various examples of how the sort of rules on check-offs that seem to be imposed on trade unions do not apply to other organisations. While listening to the hon. Member for Teignbridge, I wondered what sort of reaction there would be if a Government suggested that direct debit payments to private medical insurance firms should, by law, be subject to re-affirmation, perhaps every
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0434">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>157</span>
three years. I imagined an ideologue from another party saying, "That is not good enough; it should be every year. After all, people review their financial arrangements every year and if they are going to make donations to private medical insurance companies, surely they should be required to review them weekly, monthly or quarterly."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a sneaking suspicion that if such a suggestion were ever made, it would be roundly condemned by the hon. Member for Teignbridge and other Conservative Members as a gross infringement on individual liberty. To that extent they may be right, but if individuals have the right to make subscriptions to private medical insurance firms by direct debit, why is a contract between an individual employee and a trade union such a problem? Why does that relationship have to be subject to restrictions that Conservative Members would not accept in any other situation? Conservative Members may wish to have hang-ups about trade unions, but I ask them to consider—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely puzzled by what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Nothing in the Bill or in other proposed legislation says that if a trade union member chose to pay his subscription by direct debit a re-affirmation of consent would be required. Why is he talking about direct debits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has perplexed us that the documentation for a direct debit and the authorisation for check-off are virtually identical. The process for the union member is different only in its administration. The administration for a direct debit is undertaken by the bank; a check-off is administered by the employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed at the hon. Gentleman's making a statement like that. The difference is that with direct debits, money is taken out of a person's bank account—the customer's own money in his own account, taken with his consent—but with a check-off, the money is taken out of the pay packet before it ever reaches the employee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that in both cases a written agreement is entered into between the individual and the body that will administer the deduction. There is written consent for direct debits and for check-offs. In both cases, the individual has the right to withdraw that consent. The similarities seem obvious. We fail to see the difference. Conservative Members feel that there is a difference, and the hon. Member for Teignbridge may yet introduce legislation to prevent a deduction of union subscriptions by direct debit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, why impose those extra costs and administrative strictures on employers? I can see no reason for doing so, other than a clear ideological reason. I looked through an industrial code of practice introduced by a Conservative Government in 1972. Paragraphs 976 and 977 of the code stated that management had a responsibility
	<br><q><p>"[to] make clear to employees that it welcomes their membership of an appropriate recognised trade union and their participation in the union's activities.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>[to] make clear to [all] employees that it respects their rights under the Industrial Relations [legislation] to join a [registered] trade union and to take part in its activities, which include seeking recognition for negotiating purposes."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
That is a historical document, but what a contrast between the present and 1972.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A three-day week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy if Conservative Members take time to criticise a previous Conservative Government, but at other times and in other debates. Even though there was a Conservative Government at that time who shared many of the ideologies of Conservative members of the Committee, they recognised that trade unions formed a legitimate part of the industrial relations scene, that collective bargaining was a legitimate way of regulating affairs and that it should be no part of the role of an employer or a Government to create impediments to trade union membership. That seems to be the real purpose of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee can disagree about the relative merits of trade unions, but there is no reason why those impediments should be introduced, especially when employers say that they are not necessary and will create greater headaches for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Teignbridge seemed aghast because the Bill was different from the original Green Paper. I had understood that a Green Paper proposed legislation and was distributed for discussion and that a Bill was introduced on the basis of that discussion and consultation. There are significant omissions in the Bill from what appeared in the original Green Paper, but perhaps that is a matter for comment at another time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the debate has been about why the proposal was introduced. My view is that the Government intended to give people a fairly constant reminder that they were contributing money to organisations which they did not really want. If that was the intention, the legislation of the past 13 years that introduced the need for constant ballots means that trade union members are given reminders far more frequently than every three years that they are members of a trade union. The Government's legislation has ensured that the trade union movement has managed to hold even more postal ballots than the Labour party, but that is another issue.

Like other Opposition Members, I have had discussions with the larger employers in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consensus of opinion is that employers would rather have a check-off system than have trade union radicals running round the shop floor collecting money and stirring the members up every week. Some Opposition Members are over-enthusiastic in their support for check-off. There is some doubt as to whether it maintains trade unionism and whether it creates and fosters the right links. Nevertheless, if a group of members decide to have a check-off system which is authorised by way of the written consent of each member, what is the point of reaffirmation?

Although the hon. Member for Teignbridge enlivened our proceedings with a little hilarity, his contribution had its roots in insanity. However the clause is introduced,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0435">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
and whatever time limits and other constraints it imposes, it is a bureaucratic burden. It does nothing to advance the cause of industrial relations, or business or trade union administration. I see no merit in it. We do not know why it was introduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and lively debate. On a previous sitting, I was accused of being a Maoist. I am now accused by one of my hon. Friends of begin a warthog—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] If my hon. Friend meant that I was a tiger of wrath, I fear that I am about to lose my stripes. I doubt whether the Government could accept the proposal of my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge that check-off should be considered on a weekly or monthly basis. I think that that would have turned my golden thread into a rather large amount of red tape. It would not be consistent with the Government's approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend argued the case for his amendment extremely eloquently. The more I listened to him, the more I was persuaded. However, following the consultation and the Green Paper, my right honourable and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) announced that we would accept the proposal of, I believe, the Institute of Personnel Management for a compromise of three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most significant speech—apart from that of my hon. Friend—was not that of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras but that of the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East, who said that he would accept five years if not three years. If the Opposition have accepted the principle that consent should be required before deductions are made, it is but a small leap to embrace the proposal of the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East, who accepted the principle that that consent should be renewed. We are arguing about whether it should be renewed every five years, three years or one year. [Hon. Members: "No!"] As far as the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East is concerned—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I shall give way to the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Warley, West (Mr. Spellar) put it rather well. The Bill is a deliberate bureaucratic constraint upon trade unions and their relationships with employers. Opposition Members see no benefit in it. The Government should, at least, listen to the employers' organisations. I did not say that we do not object in principle. The proposal is a deliberate attempt to prevent check-off being carried out at all, and has been made for the Government's dogmatic reasons. If the Minister is absolutely determined, he should, at least, propose a reasonable time scale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his suggestion that there should be a reasonable time scale. He is not alone in recommending five years; the CBI also did so. However, the Institute of Directors takes the side of my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge—[	<i>Laughter.</i>] The Institute of Directors represents many small employers, about whom the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras showed concern. I am surprised that its opinion has met with such derision from Opposition Members.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>160</span>
The IOD responded to the Green Paper by saying that
	<br><q><p>"the requirement for each individual trade union member to provide annual written confirmation of the wish to pay union dues may reduce employers' costs associated with the operation of the check-off system and considers that it provides an additional measure for strengthening the rights of individuals."</p></q>
It is a matter of principle whether it is right for money to be taken out of people's pay packets without their consent. As the law stands, consent is not required. It is sufficient that there should be a collective agreement between the employer and the trade unions for the deductions to be made. The Bill will rectify that. If the Opposition think that that situation should remain without any attempt to consult employees it merely highlights the difference in our views about the rights of members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given what the Minister said, why does he not extend the provisions to other deductions from wages, such as contributions to charity or a social club? If he believes in the principle, why apply it only to trade unions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady wishes to table an amendment in respect of such deductions, she is free to do so and to argue her case, but I do not want to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have never heard of an employee being unaware that he was making a contribution to charity. The payroll giving scheme is one of the Government's triumphs. However, I have seen reports about employees who have discovered that they were trade unions members although they had not realised that they were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to send the hon. Lady some examples. There is all the difference in the world between a system in which deductions are made from an employee's pay packet for trade union membership as the result of a collective agreement between the trade union and employer and a decision by an individual to make payments to charity under the payroll giving scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that many of the arrangements, far from being freely entered into, were inherited from the days of the closed shop when people had to join the trade union to get the job in the first place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for missing the earlier debate on logic, science and technology. I am not hearing any logic now. Does the Minister agree that any check-off agreement must include a right of cancellation and that it would be illegal for an employer to refuse to act on an instruction to cancel a check-off payment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that point later. [Hon. Members: "Answer."] We have been over the discussion time and again. We do not need to take time in Committee to debate this, because every speech that has been made by Opposition Members has conceded the point that there should be individual consent for deductions to be made. There is a difference of opinion over what is meant by individual consent in the Wages Act 1986. The legal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>161</span>
advice that I have makes it perfectly clear that individual consent means that the individual is asked to give his authorisation for money to be deducted from his wages. The provisions of the 1986 Act allow for deductions to be made where a collective agreement provides for check-off to be carried out by the employer and where that agreement has been reached between the employer and the employee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked a question about cancellation. If the Minister were employing me, deducting my trade union subscriptions and passing it on to my trade union, and I gave him an instruction to cancel this in the next payroll, does he not agree that such an instruction would be absolute and the employer would have to adhere to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Bill, the employer would have to respond as soon as reasonably practical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) I apologise for not being here for the early part of the debate. The problem is that a large majority of employees do not have a contract of employment. They have written particulars of employment which, in law, do not constitute a contract. The document that is signed by a large majority of employees on the shop floor is an acknowledgement of receipt of the written particulars of employment. The acceptance of collective agreement in the particulars will be endorsed, and that will then provide for the check-off arrangement. A large number of people who sign the acknowledgement of receipt of particulars of employment do not consent to the check-off at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right. One further point arises from what he has just said. Where a collective agreement is in place, the individual cannot withdraw from check-off without withdrawing from membership of the trade union. That is quite inequitable. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston shakes his head. I do not make that up. That is the basis of the legal advice that I have had. I do not wish to enter into a debate with the hon. Gentleman about the matter. It is not the issue before the Committee. The Bill will enable the individual to withdraw from check-off if he wishes to do so and there will be a requirement that individual consent is received before check-off can be operated and before deductions can be made from the individual's pay. Furthermore, there will be a three-year requirement for renewal of that consent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister to return to the advice that he has been given. That is clearly not the case. There are numerous collective agreements concerning check-off involving people who do not comply with the check-off arrangement and yet are union members. My hon. Friend, the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) raised the point earlier. It is a well-known practice in the Amalgamated Engineering Union that members who do not want to pay union subscriptions by check-off go to their branches and ask to contract out of the check-off arrangement, while remaining members of the AEU. They have the right to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has spent too much time in the company of trade union barons. We are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
discussing what the law states and the rights of trade union members. The hon. Gentleman is discussing custom and practice in the trade union movement. Of course a union member may pay by direct debit if the union sees fit to agree to that. He does not have the right to do so if check-off has been agreed and is part of a collective agreement. We are discussing individual rights and the Bill gives individuals the right to withdraw, regardless of any deal between the employee and the employees' representatives in the trade union movement. That is an anathema to Labour Members. They see the world in terms of collective agreements and the trade union movement as acting in the interests of members. Conservative Members believe that individual rights are important and that has been the basis of our legislation in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may pull the Minister from the Aunt Sally who he is beating on the floor. If he believes that there is a problem with collective agreements, that can be dealt with. If he believes that there is a problem in coming out of the check-off scheme without leaving the union, that can be dealt with. But nothing he has said covers reaffirmation and people being stuck in schemes without being able to leave them. The Minister said that we have discussed the matter for several weeks since Second Reading, but we have not been given any examples of abuse that would merit the enormous amount of apparatus that will be necessary under the provisions for reaffirmation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no good the hon. Gentleman accusing me of parading an Aunt Sally. He should talk to his hon. Friends about that, because they raised the matter. The hon. Member for Warley, West made my point for me. There is no disagreement between the Government and the Opposition Front Bench on that. The requirement for regular renewal is the point at issue. The matters raised by the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends are redundant. One of our achievements since Second Reading is that there is now agreement that an individual trade union member should have the right to give his express consent to check-off, that no collective agreement should override that right and that he should be free to withdraw at any time. That is an advance because the law does not provide for that at present and the Bill does so. There appears to be agreement in the Committee to strengthen the rights of individual trade union members. With the exception of the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East, other Opposition Members will not accept that there may be a case for seeking regular consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) asked me to give an example. I shall give only one as I do not wish to detain the Committee, but there are many. As so many Opposition Members have connections with the Transport and General Workers' Union, it would be a good idea to provide an example from that union. I shall read from that authoritative newspaper, 	<i>The Sun</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister gives his example, will he pass the cutting to my hon. Friend so that she can read all that it says?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to provide Opposition Members with extracts from the Murdoch press for their erudition and I shall be happy to give the hon. Lady a copy of the extract which states:

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is going to say that that is a breach of law and that there are already provisions that deal with it. If the system has regularly to inform members about what has been deducted from their wages and for what purpose, then abuses of that kind will be less likely to arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Computers can make mistakes. Some Opposition Members, for example, have been sent fund-raising letters from the Conservative party. Perhaps massive optimism was the cause, but I suspect that it was a computer mistake. Does the Minister admit that mistakes can occur in the running of a system that contains so much information? The occurrence that he cited could have been caused by nothing more sinister than a computer error.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Lady for making my case for me. Mistakes can happen and that is all the more reason for a regular review. The hon. Lady might like to know that I received a letter from the right hon. and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) inviting me to join the Labour party. I am delighted to say that, despite everything, the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) shares my view that he still has a sense of humour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras made a poignant speech in support of reducing the burdens on employers. I was slightly perplexed by that speech because the hon. Member for Gateshead, East, in her speech on the previous amendment, urged me to increase the burden on employers by changing the provisions with regard to access for unfair dismissal claims. That means that a conversion must have occurred in a short space of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other hon. Members asked whether the Government have done compliance cost assessments on the requirement for a regular review of check-off. My hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge pointed out that employers have no statutory obligation to offer a check-off. There is no need, therefore, for compliance cost assessments. Employers voluntarily enter such arrangements. The Bill's provisions aim to protect the rights of the individual when an employer or trade union has agreed to carry out a scheme of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Delyn talked about the Government pushing people into inertia. That is the most extraordinary claim since my right hon. and noble Friend Viscount Whitelaw talked about going around the country stirring up apathy. The hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras and for Delyn and my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden asked about the big-bang option. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras wanted to know whether employers could collect the consent for continuing the check-off on a particular day. The hon. Gentleman said that there might be a problem deciding what day that would be. Clearly it would not be possible to have it on May day in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister has his way, union members will be at work on May day so it could be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that I have an open mind on that matter about which, we are still consulting. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge has strong views on the same matter. The hon. Gentleman was unkind about my hon. Friend who was an extremely distinguished Minister in the Department of Employment and we are still picking up some of his initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the serious point about the big bang, the hon. Gentleman asked whether it would be possible for that to be introduced. The legislation is, perhaps, a little unclear. I am happy to give a commitment to table amendments to make it clear that employers could do that on a particular day. That should not be a problem. Equally, there should not be a problem if employers choose to do that over a longer period. All that the legislation should require is that once consent has been given, it would hold for a period of three years and would be subject to renewal by that anniversary date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Delyn and other members of the Committee asked about direct debits. I covered that matter in an intervention. There is all the difference in the world between direct debit and check-off. I do not want to provoke members of the Committee unduly, but the difference is that check-off has no requirement for written consent and that there is no right to opt out of it if there is a collective agreement between the employer and the trade union. There is a clear distinction between money that is deducted from a person's bank account with their consent and money which is taken out of their pay packet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are still somewhat perplexed about the Minister's understanding of the Wages Act 1986 and the check-off system. Is he saying that if individual consent for check-off was clarified at the outset, the differences that he perceives between direct debit and check-off would disappear?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The worries that I had about that and the clarification of it have been dealt with and the results are in the Bill, with which I am perfectly satisfied. If the hon. Gentleman continues to pursue the direct debit issue, which is a red herring, he will provoke my hon Friend the Member for Teignbridge. A private arrangement between an individual and a trade union is different from an arrangement that an individual makes for a direct debit. I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree with that, on reflection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with at least one of the points made by the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney), who is not in his seat. He said that Opposition Members were too enthusiastic about check-off. He thought that there was merit in shop stewards having to recruit members, because that would give strength to the trade union movement. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendments in the spirit in which they are intended because that would help the trade union movement. As members of the Conservative party and even the right honourable and learned Member for Monklands, East (Mr. Smith) know, to get members one has to go out, argue the case and not expect them to be delivered on a plate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confess to being disappointed with the Minister's response. First, he did not concede the merits of most of our points. Secondly, his rebuttal of those points was not up to his usual standard. We have come to admire the ingenuity of his arguments, but his remarks were exceedingly shallow. The views of the hon. Member for Teignbridge are the extreme version of the Minister's. There is a line in a Philip Larkin poem about Humberside which says:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Where sea and sky and Lincolnshire all meet". The hon. Member for Teignbridge is the point where right-wing Thatcherism, 19th-century liberalism and anarchy all meet—those three are closer relatives than some of their more ardent supporters would dare to confess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Check-off has been used in this country for a considerable time. It developed slowly—not in a revolutionary way, but in a conservative way. People tried it out. Some employers were pressed by unions and, as I understand it, some unions were pressed by employers to develop the system. Reluctant employers saw that it worked for them and reluctant unions saw that it worked for other unions and, gradually, the idea of check-off was taken up because it suited all those concerned—the individual employees, the employer and the trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a shred of evidence from the Minister, or the Green Paper, or from any Conservative Member on Second Reading or in Committee, that there is any general dissatisfaction with the arrangement. The only dissatisfaction comes from a few ideological loonies somewhere in the Tory party and the Institute of Directors, the provisional wing of the Tory party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no evidence of great wrongdoing or concern. I like to establish the facts. I may elaborate, forget about the inconvenient facts and promote the convenient ones, but I like to know the facts. If Ministers have facts that we do not, they can undermine what we say. I have asked my parliamentary question, I have asked in Committee and I have asked on the Floor of the House: have the Government investigated any of the allegations to which they referred in the Green Paper? I have been assured by parliamentary answer, so it must be true, that no investigation has taken place because that is not the function of the Department. We have heard the odd excerpt from objective purveyors of the truth such as a Murdoch tabloid—in some cases, there is scarcely a distinction between the broadsheets and the tabloids these days. No evidence of any substantial concerns on this matter has been produced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most employers, trade unions and employers organisations are satisfied with the current arrangements. They believe that no money can be deducted without the prior consent of the individual concerned. We all agree on that. If the Government think that that is a problem, I am sure that the CBI, the TUC, the Labour party, the Conservative party and the officials to whom I must not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
refer could sit down and thrash out an agreement that met all the Government's rational requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those Conservative Members who attach importance to the manifesto on which they were elected—I genuinely believe that they should, even when it does not suit me—I would add that the reaffirmation provision that has been suggested did not appear in the Tory election manifesto. That manifesto referred to individual affirmation. If Conservative Members were going to the country on reaffirmation, I am sure that the two letters could have been inserted. I am sure that Conservative Members looked at the Green Paper, noticed that it was about reaffirmation and slung the word from the manifesto. The concept of reaffirmation has reappeared and we do not believe that it is a sensible way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Check-off is commonplace in Europe, which may not commend it to the Minister. Britain is trying to be at the centre of European affairs. Check-off does not apply in France because of a decision made by the French supreme court, or whatever it is called, on a law case in 1956, which resulted from an enormous barney between a Catholic print union and a communist print union. In Spain and in Italy, employees have a statutory right to have their subscriptions checked-off if they want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it is only right and proper that we should have the provision requiring consent—we are all agreed on that. There are other conditions with which we are quite happy to go along, and my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and I have outlined them. We believe that those conditions can be met. The three-year renewal, or any renewal, is a ridiculous burden on business—business will regret it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
