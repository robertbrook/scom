	<p>[MR. JAMES HILL 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Agriculture Bill [Lords]</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Agriculture Bill 	<i>[Lords]</i> the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—	<i>[Mr. Kirkhope.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say only a few words because I do not intend to drag out proceedings on the sitting motion. Those words should, perhaps, take the form of an appeal to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been in the House of Commons for 13 years—I suppose I am relatively junior—and, in my early years, I was a member of several Standing Committees. Unfortunately, those Committees were characterised by contributions from Opposition Members only. The Bill is about how markets might operate and I appeal to Government Members to participate fully in our debates. Opposition Members have come to Committee in a constructive frame of mind and we believe that the contributions of Government Members are relevant to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Ministers will adopt an open mind to the proceedings because intensive lobbying has taken place outside the House of Commons by many and various organisations that feel strongly about these matters. Most of that lobbying has been about how markets will work once the proposed changes have been implemented. Members of the Committee have wide experience of how markets work. I hope that this Committee will not be like Committees considering the Finance Bill, in which Government Members write their correspondence and do not attend to the detail of the debate. I do not say that with disrespect. I understand that Governments have timetables and that, during consideration of the Maastricht treaty, Bills have been delayed and government timetables have fallen by the way. However, we must have a free debate in Committee. Government Members may be convinced by amendments that are tabled. In particular, some amendments have been tabled by the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Marland) that relate to the capping of Milk Marque in certain circumstances. They will raise an extremely important issue and, prior to that debate, it is difficult to know precisely where we all stand. I hope that we shall have an engaging debate on those amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to add that we feel as if we are also rans. The Bill is now in Committee but, to all intents and purposes, it has almost been implemented outside the House. It is as if we are attending a theatre when the show is over, the cast and audience have gone home and, in fact, the show is already on the regional stage. The activities of Mr. Christopher Haskins and the formidable Mr. Andrew Dare, in their Punch and Judy shows, show that the Bill has advanced far beyond the stage that it should have done. We should have considered the Bill long before now. I believe
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
that it was the Government's original intention that we should have considered it during November or December 1992. Had Parliament had the opportunity of considering the matter earlier, that may have influenced to some extent the debate that is taking place in the farming communities and in the industries that are directly concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, I hope that farmers follow the proceedings of the Bill in great detail. During our proceedings amendments may be accepted that could transform the debate and transform the judgments that farmers are having to make now as to whether they enter into direct contracts with processors or join Milk Marque.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, Mr. Hill, may I say how delighted I am to see you in the Chair? Having spent some time in recent weeks, with other members of the Committee, wandering around the hedgerows of England and the Cornish banks, I am delighted to see you here. I am sure that your wise control of our deliberations will be of great benefit to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). I think, however, that another point should be raised on the motion. Although we come to the Bill comparatively late in the season because of its consideration in another place, we have perhaps the unique responsibility to ensure in the House of Commons that when powers are given to Ministers there are completely proper controls over the execution of those powers. As worded, the Bill includes a number of enabling powers that the Committee has a specific responsibility to check or scrutinise with utmost care to ensure that they will be used only when appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is most important and its provisions will come to the industry at an extremely important time. The entire way in which the industry markets its products is up for grabs. There will not be another opportunity for us to prevent the Minister from participating in the changes in an inappropriate way or at an inappropriate time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to say that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is allowed a major Bill only once in a blue moon or cheese, but the situation is not quite as bad as that. However, it is allowed a Bill only every few years. Although we come to the Bill late in the year, the Committee has to pace itself so that we can ensure that the Bill will stand for eight or 10 years without need of further amendment. In such circumstances, each enabling power will have to be examined with extreme care. When Parliament has a role in bringing into operation new powers that the Minister may seek to exercise, we as parliamentarians, must ensure that we consider those powers carefully. I have in mind the notorious clauses 4 and 13, which relates to the running and constitution of the new board. In addition, the Bill loosely provides for an annual report to be introduced when considered "appropriate". Those are matters for detailed consideration later, but it is only right that we should put down a marker at this stage that such issues will be subject to probing amendments and constructive contributions to our proceedings. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will want to contribute to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last but not least, clause 22 provides wide powers to end the potato marketing scheme if
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is necessary or expedient".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
The Committee has a responsibility to ensure that those powers are introduced and enacted only in the best possible circumstances. I welcome very much the timetabling motion because it seems to set the right pace. I hope, however, that we shall not be faced with some sort of acceleration to try to foreshorten our proceedings at a time when we need to be sure that full consideration will be given to the issues that are due to come before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>REVOCATION OF SCHEMES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 85, in page 1, line 16, leave out from 'force' to end of line 21 and insert 'on 1st April 1994'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 32, in page 2, line 3, leave out 'January' and insert 'February'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are probing amendments. Amendment No. 85 would remove the reference in clause 1(2)(b) to October 1994, which is the revocation date for the England and Wales milk marketing board. The amendment would set a common date for the revocation of all boards. We were led to believe that the later revocation date for the England and Wales milk marketing board was due to problems with the flotation of Dairy Crest. However, conversations that I have had with people in the industry and articles that I have read have led us to believe that the problems with the flotation have, to some extent, been removed and that it might be possible to bring the date forward. It has been put to me that representatives of the milk marketing board have said that they might be able to provide for an earlier date for the revocation of the scheme, which might be as early as 1 April 1994, when other schemes are being revoked. Will the Minister confirm that that is the position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representations have been made to us by the Scottish Dairy Trade Federation, which believes that a delay in revoking the Scottish scheme might lead to distortions in the market place. We know that milk crosses the border between Scotland and England. An article in 	<i>The Scottish Farmer</i> on 6 March 1993 stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Scottish Milk Marketing Board is supplying liquid milk on a trial basis to a dairy in the North of England, it was revealed this week. The milk, believed to be from farms in the Dumfries area, is being supplied to Manchester based Lancashire Dairies."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The movement of milk from Scotland to England has been rare in recent years because of the shortage of manufacturing milk North of the Border. Milk is currently flowing into Scotland at the rate of two
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
million litres a week, with Express Dairies at Lockerbie taking about 60 million litres annually and the Néstle's Carnation plant at Dumfries taking 50 million litres."</p></blockquote>
A two-way flow of milk is clearly taking place for whatever reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one scheme were revoked after another, the problem of distortion of supply and, perhaps, even of milk pricing might undermine processing plants in England or Scotland. It is difficult to deduce the result. Ministers should be pressed on whether they think that a distortion of trade would be likely. Such a distortion would not be in the interests of processors or anyone else in the milk market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been put to me by representatives of the industry in Scotland that the Bill could be interpreted as enabling the Scottish milk marketing board to bring forward its date for revocation to before 1 April 1994. That might distort the milk trade across the border and the allocation and price policies of the relevant boards. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will say what he thinks might happen if it were not possible for the English and Welsh milk marketing board to bring forward its date for revocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 deals with clause 1(3), under which the final date for the revocation of schemes is 1 January 1996. The amendment was tabled to ascertain why that date was selected. It would add another month to the date of revocation—more by accident than design—and it was tabled to establish whether the date was arbitrarily picked out of the air or whether it had some meaningful intent. Perhaps it has something to do with the reorganisation of milk marketing in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Workington said that his amendments are probing. I might be able to help him. He wants to set the same date at which successor bodies should come into effect in England and in Scotland. We allowed a longer period for the England and Wales board because of the need to float Dairy Crest; that was not because of anticipated problems but because the timetable is very tight. If I spell out the likely timetable, the hon. Gentleman will understand why we think that there is a need for some flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Assuming that the Bill receives Royal Assent in July, the milk marketing board could be expected to deliver its scheme for reorganisation to the Ministry almost immediately after that. The scheme must then be analysed by the Ministry and the Commission in Brussels, which must examine the state aid implications of assets which may be passed to Milk Marque. That is what the commission will want to discuss. The hon. Gentleman knows that Brussels is not known for frenetic activity in August. If the analysis is to be completed in three months, as we hope, we shall need to keep to a fairly tight schedule. We must then respond and the Commission must give its observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
There must then be a three month cooling-off period to allow for a challenge to the reorganisation scheme—in other words, to allow for the possibility of judicial review. I understand that that is laid down by convention or by statute and is unavoidable. In a sense there is a stand-still to test reactions to the proposals. When those three months have been negotiated and it is clear that there is no judicial challenge, the button can be pressed for the flotation of Dairy Crest. Keeping to a tight schedule, that might be a six-week process. Therefore, Dairy Crest will be floated in mid-March, if everybody hits their deadlines and there are no dislocations or earthquakes. Vesting day has been planned for April, so the schedule is extremely tight. Therefore, prescribing 1 April would allow no margin for any difficulties which might be thrown up by our scrutiny of the proposals or by the Commission. We must have a sensible timetable to cover that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The board hopes to meet the deadline, and there is no circumstance whatever in which Dairy Crest could belong to Milk Marque. Either Dairy Crest must be floated before Milk Marque comes into existence or it must be given temporary trustee status when it is floated. With the tight schedule, it seemed prudent to allow an extra margin to permit the board to have, if necessary, a further six months in which to comply with all the procedures. That is the sole reason for the different dates.

On amendment No. 32—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I told the Minister that people within the milk marketing board have suggested that the ultimate date for implementation might be brought forward. Is that so and are discussions taking place on that? Is there any chance that the date might be brought forward? Has the English and Wales milk marketing board said that it is satisfied that it can achieve implementation by 1 April 1994? Will the Minister give us some information about timing and Dairy Crest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The English and Wales board is hoping to achieve a vesting day in April 1994 simultaneously with the Scottish boards. It would be possible under existing provisions for all the vesting days to be simultaneous. The flexibility for the English and Wales board is permitted because of the complex flotation of Dairy Crest if the board puts forward a scheme which is based on a single voluntary co-operative. If the board decided that the successor organisation should have half a dozen boards, the requirement for Dairy Crest to be floated would change. If a single successor is the board's preference, Dairy Crest cannot belong to the successor body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Still on amendment No. 85, could there be distortion in the market in terms of pricing and allocation of milk if one of the boards was delayed? Can the Minister foresee any circumstances concerning the Scottish Dairy Trade Federation in which there may be distortion in the flow of milk across the border between England and Scotland or vice versa?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that there is a considerable flow of milk—my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland may wish to comment—to the north-east of England from Scotland. For example, Newcastle is supplied with a significant amount of milk that is produced in Scotland. I do not envisage any dislocation and I cannot foresee any circumstances in which a difference in dates
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
might cause dislocation. Even if 1 April proves to be too difficult, implementation could be one month or two months later. The choice is not simply 1 April or 1 October. Any intermediate date may be chosen. People will know that the process of change is under way and that it is quite a long way down the track. There will not be a permanent difference in the constitutions of the boards north and south of the border. There will simply be a slight difference in the date of implementation north and south of the border. I cannot envisage that the anxieties about dislocation will materialise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not believe that the way in which contracts between farmers and processors are drawn up may be affected if there is a delay? Presumably contracts may be drawn up across borders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that contracts are self-destructive on change of status of the relevant boards. None of the contracts of the milk marketing boards can be assumed by Milk Marque. It is written into the contracts that they come to an end with the end of the milk marketing boards. New contracts must then be signed with the successor bodies. People who buy milk in Newcastle upon Tyne or Northumberland, for example, would sign new contracts following the change in status of the Scottish boards from their present statutory status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am willing to consider the hon. Gentleman's anxieties about dislocation and to respond at an appropriate time if that would be helpful, but I cannot foresee any reason for anxiety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The date to which amendment No. 32 refers is arbitrary. We had to choose a date by which we wanted the entire business to be completed, and 1 January 1996 seemed to be reasonable. We do not want anyone to think that the matter can rumble on for ever. I do not have a religious attachment to 1 January 1996 and the hon. Gentleman said that there is no deep significance for him in the date. We had to introduce a buffer and the date was chosen arbitrarily to provide a reasonable period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The more appropriate date for the Minister might be 1 April, but I am grateful to him for the way in which he responded to the amendments. I am sure that the Committee is grateful to him for circulating the notes on clauses, which are detailed and helpful in enabling us to understand the way in which the Bill has been drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Workington pointed his finger at an intriguing discrepancy at this early stage in the Bill. The Minister kindly undertook to consider the impact of the discrepancy in the timing concerning the English and Wales milk marketing board and the Scottish boards. The Minister is having a discussion with his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and it might be helpful if the Under-Secretary commented on the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington may be right in that the discrepancy in date may result in a contract falling between two stools or in overlapping contracts having to be made. Much of the Bill is messy and it would be better to avoid unnecessary pitfalls by ensuring that events occur on the same date if there is a genuine possibility that milk producers, processors or traders may run into difficulties as a result of discrepancies.

My hon. Friend the Member for Workington referred to representations from the Scottish Dairy Trade Federation, which presumably made representations direct to the Scottish Office.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) knows, in the past few days the Scottish milk marketing board has issued a press release, which I have circulated to members of the Committee today. It shows that the board has changed tack following its involvement with the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Next, it will bring out its detailed scheme on separation of Scottish Pride and the liquid milk market. That will take a while. I am grateful to the Scottish milk marketing board for taking such a practical approach following the MMC's report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Aberdeen board and the North of Scotland board are relatively simple compared with the main Scottish board. I am sure that its position can be resolved through the usual procedure according to which a scheme is submitted at the appropriate time, which the Secretary of State considers. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State said, consultation must take place. It would be optimistic to suppose that a date earlier than April 1994 was likely. If we try to work towards that, with luck, the four boards will be able to reach a conclusion and change to the new system in April 1994, which is our target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has sought to give us some assurances and I look forward to receiving more information on whether there might be a distortion in trade. He did not concede that there would be; he said that it was unlikely, but that he would consider it. That is an example of how and why consultation during the course of proceedings is critical and why so many amendments have been tabled on the principle of consultation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 2, line 13, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(6) Where a milk marketing scheme is revoked under this section the Milk Marketing Board to which the milk marketing scheme relates shall be required to give a minimum of 6 month's written notice of termination in respect of any contract for the sale and purchase of milk between a registered producer and the said board and between a purchaser of milk and the said board.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment is intended to ensure that producers and processors of milk will be informed that their milk marketing board contracts are to be ended so that they have time to plan. During our debate on amendment No. 85, the Minister set out a timetable. I understand that Ministers are pressed, but, of course, pressed legislation is often bad legislation, as we saw with the community charge. I am sure that Ministers would not want to take
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
powers and institute changes that had not been fully considered by those affected by them, and which did not allow time to those affected to abide by that legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment expressly provides for termination of current milk supply and purchase contracts on the date of termination of the milk marketing scheme and for adequate notice to be given. That would provide a clean break, ensure freedom of choice in contracting with a suitable partner and allow farmers and the industry time to plan. During discussions in another place, Lord Howe stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"contracts between the boards and producers on the one hand and purchasers on the other will end on vesting day."—	<i>[Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 8 December 1992; Vol. 541, c. 140.]</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 15 of Schedule 1 provides that a residuary milk marketing board may not purchase or sell milk. It is inferred from that that arrangements will need to be made to end the current supply and purchase contracts on termination of the scheme. As to the question of notice, Lord Howe added on 25 January that Ministers would have to have regard to the needs of all parties when deciding what period of notice was appropriate. He said that as the scheme of reorganisation would, in effect, end 60 years of statutory milk marketing, producers and purchasers of milk should receive adequate notice of change. He took the view that that rested properly with the Minister's control. We are discussing adequate time, and I have great sympathy with the farming community and the processors, who see the debate raging all around them. They can read about it extensively in the farming press. Northern Foods has sent me a thick pack of cuttings almost every day from journals throughout the United Kingdom commenting on the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until a scheme is approved, it is extremely difficult for real decisions and valid judgments to be made. Similarly, it is very difficult for processors and producers to speculate on what might emerge from the Committee in several weeks' time and with what they might be faced. In replying to the debate, Ministers should be able to assure the industry and the farming community that they will have reasonable time to decide on the basis of the most up-to-date information, which will be available only when the Bill has undergone all the parliamentary procedures, has been approved by Brussels and, if required, has gone through the process of potential judicial review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention behind the amendment is to allow for a minimum six-month period for termination. Amendment No. 85 aimed to ensure that everyone could meet the April deadline for the transformation of the boards into their new organisations. Were amendment No. 86 to be adopted and the six-month period run only from the point of approval by the Ministry and the Commission, and from the expiry of the three-month period of judicial review, we would be beyond April. That could not happen so the amendments are somewhat at odds with each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the purpose of the amendments, which is to emphasise that people need reasonable reassurance, but I think that the practices of the industry demonstrate that that can be achieved. There is a goodly gathering of the dairy industry in the Room—one of the rare occasions on which it gets together as such an amicable group! In discussing "New Ways", the milk marketing board determined the contracts three times, so I do not think that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
the hon. Gentleman's measure is necessary. I shall spell out why because I do not want to repulse the spirit of the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, the boards may not transfer contracts with their producers or their purchasers to their successors. The residuary boards are specifically prohibited from buying or selling milk, so both types of contract must end on vesting day. That is a matter of common consent—it is not disputed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England and Wales, the milk marketing board and the Dairy Trade Federation have already agreed an amendment to the purchaser contracts which would automatically terminate them on the revocation of the scheme or on any other revocation of the board's exclusive right to buy producers' milk. The date of revocation would be one of the matters discussed by Ministers in consultation with processors and retailers of milk. Therefore, the date of revocation of the milk marketing board is one of the features of reorganisation which clause 3(2) requires the board to bring to its producers' attention. Clause 5 requires any change in that date to be brought to the producers' attention. We know what is happening in the sector; people are waiting for the change to take place and they know its likely broad shape. It is not being sprung upon an unwary world. As the hon. Member for Workington said in his opening remarks, changes in the marketplace are beginning to occur that reflect the anticipated changes. A milk producer or purchaser would have to have lived in a peculiarly insulated world to be unaware of the debate which, as the hon. Gentleman said, has been raging around him and over his head. To some extent, people have been fighting up his garden path to buy his milk. That is a happy state of affairs, although it is amazing how many people do not view it as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept, as does my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, that the Ministry and other concerned bodies will have to be conscious of the need to make matters clear at the earliest opportunity so that people will know what to expect. But the practices of the industry are such that the change will not come upon people unawares. As the purchasers and suppliers have made the necessary arrangements in anticipation of the changes—most contracts will come to an automatic end—we will not be doing them a service by giving a six-month period of notice, which would stretch the timetable for the transformation. All of us agree that once the change is undertaken and confirmed, it should be brought into effect at the most sensible, early opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that. I believe that he has struck the balance. The problem is difficult because we must all recognise that there is a possibility of more restriction, delays and bureaucracy being built into a system which already has far too much. If, as a result of the Bill, the industry believes that it is entering the new regime with its arms tied behind its back by new restrictions, we will have done the industry a bad turn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Workington. I am sure, from my contact with the industry and particularly with producers, that the industry is requesting clarity and an expeditious timetable towards the new regime rather than further delays. We should accept
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
the Minister's thoughtful assurance that he is aware of and alert to the problems and I hope that the amendment will not be pressed to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall not press the amendment to a Division because, in many ways, it is a probing amendment about the timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that people know in general what is happening—I think that the words that he used were that the framework or the nature of the industry will be arising out of the Bill. The industry does not know what will happen to the amendments that deal with the capping of Milk Marque because the divisions, if there are going to be any, have not taken place. If Milk Marque were capped at 40 per cent., 45 per cent., 50 per cent. or 55 per cent., depending on which amendment is supported, it would totally transform the milk arrangement, or a scheme of reorganisation, arising from provisions in the Bill. It would transform the market. Milk Marque would, no doubt, have emergency meetings to consider the new position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not threatening that that transformation will happen; I only put the proposition that Parliament has the right to decide whether Milk Marque should be capped if it wants to go into processing activities. A later amendment might attempt to cap Milk Marque even if it does not want to go into processing activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that such matters are not being dealt with by the Committee and they have not been considered by Parliament. The Bill may be very different when it emerges from Committee. I do not know if that will happen. It is a matter for the Minister and for Parliament to decide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The contradiction between my previous amendment and this one has arisen from a slippage in the parliamentary timetable. Maastricht has delayed consideration of the Bill. When the Bill was originally introduced, I think that Ministers had it in mind that a period of six months might have been available for consideration by farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should have been considered by Parliament in November 1992 when we originally expected the Second Reading to take place. For a time, we did not know where it would be introduced first—the Lords or the Commons. I did some work on the Bill during the summer recess and I assumed that it would be read a Second time on about 25 October. We expected early consideration. Had the Bill been brought before Parliament earlier, there would have been a far longer period of consultation, and producers and purchasers of milk would have had more time to consider its implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not pressing the amendment to a vote. However, I want to register with Ministers the point that by the time the Bill has passed through all its stages and has been dealt with by the Commission—if that is considered necessary under judicial review provisions or requirements—there may not be time fully to consider the Bill. In such conditions, the need for maximum consultation must be emphasised in the Bill. Throughout the Bill's stages, we shall return to the principle of consultation. It is an enabling Bill and we are not in a position to deal with the detail of it. However, as we are not in a position to amend what Ministers decide, there must be consultation, especially if the industry and the producers are driven into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
a tight timetable, as the Minister has conceded they will be. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have a unique opportunity during our proceedings to consider the thrust of the legislation. We are proceeding in a business-like way and I hope that we shall be able to have a more wide-ranging debate, in which Conservative Members will express their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 in effect revokes the schemes and ends 60 years of milk marketing arrangements in the United Kingdom. For the greater part of those years since the 1930s, those arrangements have been relatively successful. Only in recent years have difficulties arisen that have led to the introduction of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem as I and, if I might say, many people outside the House see it, is that Milk Marque has set itself an objective that everyone finds very worrying. I am told that it wants 80 per cent. of milk producers to sign up with it. The view of milk processors and purchasers is that Milk Marque will become a voluntary monopoly. I know that the milk marketing boards reject that terminology but the allegation persists and deep concerns are being expressed. Many of the amendments that have been tabled are of a probing nature and will try to extract from Ministers undertakings about the activities of Milk Marque and other successor bodies in other parts of the United Kingdom in the new deregulated market. We are not convinced that Milk Marque will not be able to abuse its position in the market place. People in this Room who are not member of the Committee may want to read an interesting statement that was made by a Minister on the Floor of the House yesterday. I advise everyone to get a copy of yesterday's 	<i>Hansard</i> to read what was said by Under-Secretary of State for Corporate Affairs on the issue of competition. He made a statement about
	<br><blockquote><p>"strengthening the law to curb anti-competitive practices in the marketplace."-	<i>[Official Report,</i> 14 April 1993; Vol. 222, c. 844.]</p></blockquote>
No doubt Ministers will want to comment on that statement during our proceedings as it has implications for this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall dig out a paragraph from the Minister's statement in which he said that it is proposed to strengthen the current competition legislation in four ways:
	<br><blockquote><p>"stronger powers of investigation; additional scope for enforceable undertakings; provision of interim orders to suspend anti-competitive practices; and some coverage of property rights. Stronger investigative powers for the Director General of Fair Trading should enable him to establish more quickly whether there should be a full-scale investigation."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 14 April 1993; Vol. 222, c. 844]</p></blockquote>
I draw that statement to the attention of the Committee and to our wider audience because when we consider amendments it is important that we have our minds on it. That statement does not define existing legislation or the amending legislation but it provides a pointer to how the Government are thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that the market is entering two years of some uncertainty. We understand from Leon Brittan that while he is minded to accept that articles 84 and 85 of the treaty will not be breached as a result of the proposals, which he has already considered and which will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
considered under a more formalised arrangement later this year, he will want to monitor the schemes that will subsequently be set out. He has residual concern about the power of Milk Marque in the market if it is true that it will secure as much as 80 per cent. of the market. I should say that I hope that it will not get 80 per cent. Like many of my hon. Friends, I believe that that would be unhealthy for the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that in the packs of information that Northern Foods sends us almost daily—I should say that I read those packs so that it will continue to send them—there have been a number of comments expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note also the comments of Members of Parliament of all political persuasions about what might happen were Milk Marque to obtain 80 per cent. of the market and control events in the way that it currently wants to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is designed to revoke the scheme. Without introducing too great a political note into our proceedings, I would like it put on record that, prior to the general election, when my hon. Friend the Member for South Shields (Dr. Clark) was the Opposition's agriculture spokesman—I think that my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) was a member of his team—we committed ourselves to retaining a milk marketing board with a milk marketing scheme, but we wanted the scheme amended because we recognised that cases that were being dealt with in Europe had implications for the scheme in the United Kingdom. It was not as though we were pinning ourselves to an historic practice which we knew to be outdated. Everyone recognised that changes had to be made. We wanted the scheme to be amended and we wanted to retain a statutory framework within which, to some extent, a deregulated market could operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Had quotas not been introduced in the early 1980s, there is a distinct possibility that we would not be faced with the problems that we have today regarding a milk shortage in the market. We have been told that milk quotas will be retained for at least seven years, but there is no guarantee that, in the next century, there will not be a complete reversal of the Community's and the Government's position on that. We could eventually have an entirely free market—the hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) shakes his head, so perhaps he will intervene to tell me the basis of his theory that there will not be a free market. There is a 12 per cent. oversupply in Europe, which is why quotas were introduced. The figure was higher originally, but there have been reductions in recent years. If the hon. Gentleman has some knowledge which has not been imparted to me, perhaps he will tell the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be stopped by the Government Whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope not, because our debate should be wide ranging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a free market, it might be necessary to introduce another scheme, if only to protect British producers from the difficulties that arose in the late 1920s and 1930s. I am not suggesting that that is on the cards or that we would return to a regime in which people poured milk down the drains all over the country. There were some interesting debates when the original legislation was introduced and some members of the Committee may wish to read what happened in the dusty volumes of 	<i>Hansard,</i> which are on the shelves of the main Corridor next to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
Tea Room. We do not even want to consider such a position, but in conditions of an entirely free market, we could be eased in that direction and we might then want a statutory arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill wipes out the possibility of establishing a milk marketing board in future without introducing new legislation. The Government could have left much of the constitution of the milk marketing boards intact as a vehicle to be used in future if conditions change. They could also have left intact a scheme which could have been amended to cover the supply of milk and to provide the vehicle that some believe should be available for funding some of the assets that the milk marketing boards currently hold. The Committee will have some interesting discussions on that. Why dismantle a statutory framework? The Government could simply remove the powers that interfere with the new deregulated market that the Minister believes is necessary following the cases that have come before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect of the existing scheme that clause 1 would revoke has been very important historically to the industry—the joint committee of the milk marketing board. That committee has many responsibilities and I shall remind the Committee of them. Paragraph 66.5 of the amended milk marketing scheme requires the parties represented in the joint committee to negotiate on a number of matters. They include the description of the milk to be sold by the board, the delivery of milk to be sold by the board, the terms on which milk is to be sold by the board, the price of milk to be sold by the board, the amounts of any allowances to be made to buyers, the classes of persons and premises to whom or in respect of which such allowances are to be made, the conditions on which such allowances are made, and the arrangements for making milk available to buyers. Those matters are all dealt with by current arbitration arrangements under a statutory scheme. I know that during our proceedings there will be much talk about arbitration, disputes procedures, and the need, perhaps, for some sort of regulation, which the Minister conceded on the Floor of the House may be necessary. He said that he would be minded to consider regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am

Under current arbitration arrangements if the parties are unable to agree on any of the matters to which I have referred, paragraph 66.9 of the scheme provides that either party may refer the matter to arbitration. As permitted by the scheme, the joint committee has agreed the appointment of a sole arbiter, currently, Sir Terence Beckett, and the decision of the arbiter is binding on the joint committee, unless both parties agree not to accept it. In practice, I understand that that has happened only once, although someone else told me that it had happened on four occasions. The joint committee has been a formidable forum in which difficulties that have arisen between purchasers and producers have been debated, argued out and resolved. The Bill does not make much provision for that. In so far as the arbiter will no longer exist and, therefore, will not be able to impose a settlement, there is clearly a major deficiency in the Bill.

I suggest that a statutory framework is required to enable us to sort out problems in future. As I have said, we shall advance our arguments in greater detail when we deal with later amendments.

During recent weeks, however, there has been a development. We should take account of it because it is a matter of great concern to the processors. It has been suggested that a problem might arise in the event that Milk Marque is able to obtain 80 per cent. of the market. The formidable Mr. Andrew Dare—I always call him "formidable" because I find him impressive in conversation. He is very convincing and, as I leave the room, I always wonder whether I should have asked him any other questions. It is then that I begin to change my mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The farmers can be very proud of him; he is an impressive advocate. However, he made a major error of judgment some weeks ago when he made his statement. I am sure that, in retrospect, he thinks it was an error. When he made his statement, bullying—I know he denies it now, but that is what it was—the processors into accepting what he thought it was necessary for them to do, he provoked a backlash in the industry, which has been reported throughout the farming press and has caused much concern. I am sure that I shall be corrected by the Secretary of State if I am wrong. I do not know why we call the Minister of Agriculture by that name. He is a Cabinet Minister. So, if I refer to him as the Secretary of State, I am sure that I shall be forgiven. I am sure that there is an historic explanation, but it seems to me to be utterly wrong that he is called the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as I understand, it was only after an argument with the Secretary of State—I am sure that I shall be corrected if I am wrong—that he was instructed to withdraw his statement. He said that it was not intended as a threat to those who chose not to participate at that stage. To me, it did appear to be a threat. Anyone who read the wording of that document saw how matters might develop in future. The statement said that while the form did not commit anyone to buying the amount stated, it was a major factor that would be taken into account in the sale of milk contracts, other things being equal. Thus if there were a shortage of milk, processors might not get any milk at all if they had declined to submit a form. The return may be ignored or scaled down if it appeared not to be a genuine estimate of business needs—for example if the estimate was inflated in anticipation of a shortage. That suggests to me that an attempt was being made to put pressure on the processors before we had had time to consider those matters in Committee and before Parliament had taken a decision. If that is how Milk Marque will operate, an arrangement must be set up to ensure that there is no bullying in the industry. Many of us believe that the only way in which such a framework could be satisfactorily established is under a statutory scheme or statutory arrangement. That is at the heart of the case. I hope that Ministers will take on board the question of disputes and at

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
least allude to the possibility of difficulties being resolved outside a statutory arrangement, in which we have little confidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a demand for the capping of Milk Marque, to which I have already referred on several occasions. I do not know whether capping will be necessary at this stage. To some extent, how such matters will be dealt with will depend on how Milk Marque behaves during the coming months and on what emerges from consideration of the Bill. In the event that Milk Marque has to be capped at some stage in the future, that procedure might have to be enshrined in legislation. If that is not possible, a decision might have to be taken under a statutory arrangement. I do not know whether, under the Bill, in the event that Ministers decide later in the year that they have to cap Milk Marque, they would have the power so to do. As the market develops, it might be felt that the competition authorities cannot deal with problems that might arise and that Milk Marque will have to be capped. Will Ministers have the power to do that and would they have those powers if a statutory scheme were retained, which was amendable in Parliament, or would they need a statutory board? I do not know, and I think that Ministers should address the matter.

There was an interesting article, which will not have given particular pleasure to the ears of the producers, written by Mr. Michael Evanson, a former commercial director of the Dairy Trade Federation. It was printed in 	<i>Milk Industry</i> earlier this year. Mr. Evanson referred to quotas on processors. That is a novel idea. In so far as we cannot predict what will happen to marketing conditions and to milk shortages, it might be in the interests of the Committee were I to quote from the article. The introduction of quotas is not Labour party policy but it is a consideration that we should bear in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps some paraphrasing would be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a very brief quote, Mr. Hill. The passage reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With quotas and the restriction on production you either allocate the milk on a price basis—it goes to the person with the deepest pocket—or you allocate it by some sort of quota. I have argued for a long time that if it makes sense to have quotas for producers, the corollary must hold good and there should be quotas for the purchasers."</p></blockquote>
The article goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As it is the industry is sliced in two. The producers are on one side with fixed quotas, security and an asset and the buyers are now being cast adrift in a series of open boats, hitting each other around the head with their available oars to see which one can get back to land and buy milk first. Inevitably there are going to be some for whom there is no milk. That doesn't seem to me to be progressive development at all. You spend sixty years developing a system that has given stability and equanimity, and then you allow yourself to get into this situation. It appears to be perverse in the extreme."</p></blockquote>
I do not know whether Ministers have considered placing quotas on processors and purchasers, but I am not proposing that course. However, someone has, and it is an interesting concept. I presume that, in future, Ministers might consider imposing quotas if ever we had a problem that could be solved only in that way. If quotas were to be introduced would the Bill provide the necessary powers to do that? Would not it be necessary to have a statutory scheme, which would be more concerned with the collection of milk, or a statutory arrangement, such as a board with powers, which could be amended to provide for changes? I put it to Ministers only that they consider such
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
matters. That is all I have to say at the moment. I have cut out the rest of my contribution because I shall be able to deal with other issues when we discuss subsequent amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hill, for calling me. I shall be brief. I agree with some of the remarks of the hon. Member for Workington—for example, his comment that it would be unfortunate if Milk Marque were to take 80 per cent of the market is one with which I agree wholeheartedly. However, I disagree with him about quotas. Having spent, like the Minister, several years in the European Parliament, I sensed a theme of protectionism running through the institution and, indeed, in the agricultural policy of farmers and Governments of western Europe. It is unlikely that other members of the European Community would ever agree to a free market in milk, no matter what our view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the suggestion of the hon. Member for Workington that we might have a quota system for processors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The suggestion was put forward in his speech that there might be a quota system for processors, which would stultify competition and lead to less innovation. If we had had a system of quotas for processors five, six or seven years ago, the Muller company would not have been given quotas for processing milk in the United Kingdom. That company makes more yoghurt in this country than it makes in Germany, which underlines the need not to have quotas for processors, but to have the market operating to ensure that the milk goes to those processors who will make most use of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the clause because it will be a good thing when the umbilical cord between Dairy Crest and the rest of the milk industry is broken. Dairy Crest has been used as a processor of milk, but that it has not had the right marketing skills. We can all remember the disaster of Lymeswold. That product was marketed badly despite the fact that it was produced satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Bill will help the balance of trade in dairy products. There has been a temptation from time to time to use the scarce milk produced in Britain to make sink products such as butter, which have been sold into intervention. It would have been better to use the milk to produce value-added products, such as cheese, which would have helped to reduce the imbalance of trade from which we are suffering and about which the Minister and the Government care greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, the Bill will be in the interests of competition in the dairy industry and in the interests of the producers, the processors, the consumers and the balance of payments. The Bill will be warmly welcomed throughout the country. I have great pleasure in supporting the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a special appeal to the Committee. During the Easter recess I had the misfortune to fall off a ladder. Sneezing is comfortable, coughing is comfortable and even speaking is comfortable, but laughing is very uncomfortable, so I appeal to the Committee, especially the hon. Member for East Loathian, not to crack jokes such as the one he cracked just now. I assure him that they are very uncomfortable for cracked ribs.

We need an inscription in every Committee Room and perhaps in the Chamber to the effect that "If it works, don't fix it." It should probably be in Latin so that it fits in with the architecture of Barry and Pugin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important when discussing the clause to recognise that the scheme has worked relatively well in a difficult area. All parts of the industry would think us remiss if we calmly tore it up this morning without paying tribute to those who made it work for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I approach the Bill from a slightly different viewpoint to that of the hon. Members for Hendon, South and for Workington—it is interesting to see them joining hands across the Committee. There have been distortions in the marketing of milk and other products which have worked to the disadvantage of producers and consumers. I said on Second Reading that during the past 10 years retail food prices have risen by 52 per cent., but the retail price index has risen by 70 per cent. and as every farmer knows, during that period farmgate prices have risen by only 18 per cent. Those are major discrepancies, and I come to the Committee to test whether they will be reversed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the decade 1982–1992 the price paid to milk producers increased by 45·5 per cent. but the price on supermarket shelves increased by more than 70 per cent. Producers and consumers want the benefits of the new regime or scheme that the Bill will introduce to work for them and not merely for the middle men. The threat to consumers comes not from a powerful, strong, well-supported producer co-operative but from an organisation that is so weakened in the open market that it does not have enough elbow to wrestle with the large organisations—the processors and distributors. An effective, well-supported producer co-operative, as in so many other member states in the Community, can work very effectively not only for milk producers and other agriculture producers, but for consumers. In most other member states producer cooperatives in the high streets compete with the multinationals, but in this country we are dominated by a few multinationals. It is significant that some of them have been staunch supporters of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for Milk Marque to be a success, not only for Milk Marque's sake but for the sake of the consumer, for it will be a useful new power in the market. I do not have the same misgivings about the magic 80 per cent. as the hon. Members for Hendon, South and for Workington. If 99 per cent. of producers choose to join Milk Marque, who are we to stop them? We should not do so, as long as the legislative framework exists to prevent abuse of monopoly power. The power that Milk Marque could abuse would be far less than that which we have witnessed in recent years with the amalgamation and increasing control of the market by a few processors and distributors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify the position? I do not believe that there is much difference between what I was saying and what the hon. Gentleman was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he does not mind if Milk Marque has 80 per cent. of the market, as long as a statutory framework exists. That does not exist, so is the hon. Gentleman still happy for Milk Marque to have 80 per cent. of the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and I am grateful to him. I hope that he and I—perhaps the hon. Member for Hendon, South will join us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman answer the question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I do not believe that we can be wholly confident as the Bill is drafted and I agree with the hon. Gentleman on that, as I think does the hon. Member for Hendon, South. As the Committee proceeds with the healthy parliamentary balance in which hon. Members' votes count for the first time in two decades, there may be some interesting cross-support during Divisions. I hope that that will enable us to create a framework for true competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that we do not put restrictions in the way of producers if they wish to come together in an effective co-operative as they have done in many other Community countries, and that we do not prevent Milk Marque from being successful by artificial means. The hon. Member for Workington and other members of the Committee will agree that that will be a difficult balancing act. That is why I said when discussing the timetable motion that I hope that our progress will be steady so that we can get the balance right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington referred obliquely to the future of quotas. We had some exchanges on Second Reading on quotas and we would be remiss if we let the clause go by without noting that we have not had a detailed explanation of the Government's position or that of the Commission and other member states on the vexed question of how quotas will be managed, not only in the short term but in the medium and long term. It is critical that the issue is faced. At present, it is part of the regime in which the boards are the critical players. It is critical that before we complete our proceedings, we should be given a sign of the way in which Ministers and their colleagues on the Council of Agriculture intend to proceed on quota management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1(4) refers to the transfer of assets. I am sure that we shall have a detailed discussion on that later, but it is important to put down a marker. The transfer of assets is causing great interest and concern in the industry, and the sooner that Ministers tell us how they think the Bill will proceed and the sooner that we raise any matters on which we seek assurances, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If producers in most parts of the United Kingdom are determined to make a success of the new co-operatives, Parliament, within the right framework—I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Workington during his intervention—must try to ensure that they are able to do so. We have suffered for too long in this country from lack of co-operatives and co-operation in this and other sectors of the industry. The result is that we have been unable to compete as effectively in the European Community as we would have liked. Too much French cheese comes to Cornish supermarkets and we are only beginning to see Cornish cheese in French supermarkets. That is the test of the inadequacy with which co-operatives and producer organisations have formerly operated in the market. I hope very much that the proposals will prove to be an effective change. However, we must not delude ourselves. We cannot say today with total confidence that the Bill will put

in place a new regime that will be so much better than its predecessor that we can be confident that producers and consumers will benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a brief contribution because I do not want to delay the Committee. Many of my farming constituents have asked me why it is necessary to introduce the Bill and revoke the milk marketing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) alluded to the fact that we are not self-sufficient in milk quota. That is one of the main reasons why it is necessary to revoke the scheme. We need to use our national quota more effectively. We do not want it used, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) suggested, to manufacture sink products such as dried milk powder. As Britain has been allowed to import liquid milk since 1988 and a added-value products are imported in significant amounts, it is vital that we use our milk quota as effectively as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the issues of fair trading and competition. Producers should be able to form groups. I do not know what the Minister will say on this matter, but I ask that he presses for nationally portable quotas in the Commission as soon as possible so that our effective processors can use our national quota as effectively as possible. I welcome the proposals in clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a cheerful thought about quotas although I think that the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) has just highlighted how the Government are trying to create a free market in a market that can never be free precisely because supplies are restricted under quota. We shall probably return to that subject from time to time in our debates on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a rare pleasure to encounter a Liberal with a sense of humour, so I shall try not to stimulate it too often, but I am very sorry to hear about the injuries that were sustained by the hon. Member for North Cornwall. I do not know whether he was looking for his leader and got lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 must be the key clause to the Bill. It provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Each of the milk marketing schemes having effect under the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958…is hereby revoked"—</p></blockquote>
just like that, as someone used to say—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Tommy Cooper used to say that. We must be careful not to make the hon. Member for North Cornwall laugh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a fundamental clause that brings to an end the valuable work that has been done on behalf of milk producers, consumers and associated industries over a long period. I hope that, at an appropriate point in our debate, the Minister will join us in paying tribute to the valuable work that has been done by the milk marketing boards. As my hon. Friend the Minister for Workington said, the boards were set up for the good reason that there were all types of problems in the market in its early days. The boards have done a first-class job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come from a farming but not dairy background, and I shall start by examining the situation from the producers' point of view. How many of the dairy farms on the west coast of Britain are small family businesses which have been through all manner of difficulties; The fact that those small companies and businesses have been able to rely on that milk cheque coming in regularly has kept them functioning for years. Such co-operative organisation of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
the market in the interests of all concerned has certainly helped to sustain those small family businesses and has improved the quality of the national dairly herd. It has improved milk records, and has made advances in genetics and artificial insemination. So much has been achieved under the auspices of the milk marketing boards. They have promoted organisation in the milk market. I have no doubt that that is one of the reasons why more doorstep milk—as it is described—is sold in this country than anywhere else in Europe. It has been good for consumers because it has ensured that good quality, healthy milk has been available to people for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal has been achieved. The milk marketing boards have been even-handed across the country. Whether a dairly farm is situated close to a creamery or in the remotest highlands of Scotland, milk is collected and delivered to the appropriate point in the market and everyone receives a fair price for it. One wonders whether that will be possible in future. Obviously, transport costs will be that much higher where there are smaller units and smaller quantities to be collected from remoter locations. That sort of benefit could be lost if abolition goes ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there is a problem, about which the hon. Member for Hendon, South, the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Workington spoke: the consequence of vertical integration by which processing companies, the small independent dairies, will have no choice but to buy all their milk from the milk marketing board and will find themselves in competition with companies owned by the milk marketing board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I freely acknowledge, as I did on Second Reading, that that is a genuine problem, which is unsustainable, and something must be done about it. But, for goodness sake, is it really necessary to throw out the good milk with the bad? That is what I fear the Government are doing. If the matter had been addressed in a constructive, positive way, it would have been possible to find ways of amending the scheme to deal with that specific problem, but no, not this Government; the whole lot must be thrown out because it is percieved by people, such as the hon. Member for Hendon, South and, no doubt, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as ideologically unsound. Anything that interferes in the free market must go. That is why this blanket legislation is before the Committee. I fear that we shall replace one genuine problem of unfair competition with another, because big powerful people will be involved in the new market that will be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not only a problem with milk; It relates also to other food sectors. We have all heard the sleazy stories about how supermarket chains, which have such massive control over the retail trade in food, apply inappropriate and, some would say, corrupt pressure to suppliers that want their products on supermarket shelves. I think that Safeway was reported as requiring companies that wanted to supply frozen vegetables to that store to, in effect, pay a bribe and to put money up front to buy shelf space in Safeway. That sort of stranglehold is developing in many parts of the food market. There are many producers and millions of consumers, but comparatively few powerful conglomerates that control the retail section of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0018">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
It is the same with milk. There is a problem with unfair competition, which must be addressed, but I strongly believe that the Government are going about it in the wrong way. It would have been constructive to seek appropriate amendments to the legislation and to the scheme to ensure that there was fair competition in the market. But we now run the risk of losing all that is good about the milk marketing boards, which have achieved so much in the interests of not only producers but consumers and everyone else. My inclination is to vote against the clause standing part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Workington set out comprehensively the reasons why the Opposition believe that there should be more effective statutory control of revocation. At least there should be some statutory control. Ministers will know from Second Reading that there were concerns expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber about revocation and its effects. One hon. Member referred to the Bill as an Arthur Daley measure which said, in effect, "Trust me, guvnor". That is not the sort of motto which would be right and proper for a Select Committee or for the House. I do not need to remind the Minister, but I shall do so, that the hon. Member who referred to the Bill as an Arthur Daley measure was a Conservative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern on both sides of the Chamber about what type of monster, if it is a monster, we are creating as a result of revocation. Milk Marque will not serve the interests of the market because it will be a monopoly. People have talked about 60 per cent., 65 per cent., 75 per cent. and 80 per cent. Whatever the percentage, there will be the creation of a monopoly and the propensity for the abuse of a dominant position which has been given much consideration by the European Community. The growth and spread of the Commission's influence and the future inclusion of other countries in the Community will mean that the abuse of that dominant position will become more of a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been put to me that the abuse of dominant position might not be a problem because if there were any evidence or suggestion of abuse, the restrictive trade practices Acts would deal with it. As the hon. Member for North Cornwall pointed out, Milk Marque will be a co-operative and he welcomed that. My understanding, however, is that the provisions of the restrictive trade practices Acts do not apply to co-operatives. Will the Minister put his mind to that and reassure us that there is a legislative framework to deal with what could be a serious abuse in the new market?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to the amount of support that the scheme or schemes should have received from the Government in recent years. Hon. Members will know that in 1986 a non-binding arbitration was conducted by the late John Silkin, a former Member who, all hon. Members will concede, had great expertise in agriculture. He was asked to advise on marketing and producing and he referred to low-fat milk, which the Minister, when he opened the debate on Second Reading cited as one reason why the schemes would have to be revoked or amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
John Silkin said that he felt that low-fat milk would be of greater importance as time passed.
	<br><blockquote><p>"to an extent where unless care is taken they may begin to threaten the existence of the scheme itself. It is my opinion, and it is to the interests of both the Milk Marketing Board and the Dairy Trade Federation, that a common course of action should be resolved between them."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
John Silkin went on to recommend that there should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"an urgent and immediate inquiry into the effect of the production of low-fat milk and other products, and on foreign manufacturers, which were not embraced in the original scheme. I do not believe that a committee of investigation, as suggested by the Milk Marketing Board, nor an approach to the Commission, as suggested by the Dairy Trade Federation, are appropriate methods of dealing with the problems. It is my recommendation that the Ministry should undertake an alternative internal inquiry into the problem which, unless care is taken, might begin to threaten the existence of the scheme itself."</p></blockquote>
In spite of oft-repeated representations to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from the Dairy Trade Federation, the Ministry failed to undertake the inquiry suggested by John Silkin. Representations were made to the European Commission in 1987 by the board and, in 1988, by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Dairy Trade Federation and the board. The Commission was unimpressed and unconvinced of the importance of the low-fat milk problem and the Ministry asked the Dairy Trade Federation to defer further action pending resolution of another matter in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That gives a strong impression that the Government were quite keen for the board to be put in an impossible position, given the way in which the milk trade and the milk market had developed. I hope that Ministers will take careful note of the concerns that have been expressed on both sides of the Committee and recognise that they have been made in the interests of effecting a strong milk industry because although agriculture might seem a somewhat esoteric parliamentary subject, it effects everyone as a consumer. Whatever our political interests, it is important that we all have breakfast, so I hope that Ministers will ensure that the schemes that are being revoked by the Bill are replaced by measures that can be controlled. There is no point in winding-up a scheme that is supported by people as diverse as Conservative Members and Phil Archer and replacing it with some kind of hydra-headed monster.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That contrasted with the Minister's air of confidence, who said that arrangements are being made about contracts. That must be contrasted with the point made by the hon. Member for North Cornwall.

I am familiar with the dairy trade in Cornwall as I married the daughter of a farmer just outside the hon. Gentleman's constituency—he has now retired. The hon. Gentleman said, to paraphrase the old adage, "if things aren't bust don't fix them". That is particularly important in the context of some of the issues that have been raised. Why abolish? Why not amend, particularly given the air of confusion that seems to be reigning? That confusion will not be beneficial in the short term to the farmer or to the consumer. There are enormous uncertainties, which need to be considered. I was reading some of the press comments on the Bill. It is interesting that some of the more detailed comments were made in the Scottish press. I mention that not only because my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian is sitting beside me, but because it was interesting that the Scottish press was taking the Bill seriously. On 6

March, 	<i>The Scotsman</i> referred to leaders of the industry taking off their gloves "for a bare-knuckle fight". By 24 March, it reported:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The war of words in the struggle for a major share of the £3 billion a year milk market in England and Wales intensified yesterday."</p></blockquote>
The struggle resulted in a conflict between Cristopher Haskins and Andrew Dare. The idea of a bare-knuckle fight between those two does not appeal to me as someone opposed to blood sports, but it emphasises the degree of confusion that exists in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

That uncertainty must be clarified. The Government should explain their views in more detail. The confusion was elaborated upon in some detail in 	<i>The Herald</i> on 30 March. It is worth bringing that article to the attention of the Committee. It was detailed and thoughtful and referred to "informed" sources in the industry. One is never too sure who informed sources are; whether they are "those who are never here", Government Members or, indeed, people from the industry in the Public Gallery. The article said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Informed sources in the industry now believe that the enabling legislation contained in the Agriculture Bill, currently going through Parliament, will struggle to reach the statute book before the summer recess."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any further delay would seriously affect the proposed timing for the launch of the non-statutory organisations to the five UK milk marketing boards. If that happens, the vesting date for the new voluntary producer co-operatives might have to be put back to October 1,1994"—</p></blockquote>
it was interesting to hear that Minister's comments on that earlier—
	<br><blockquote><p>"This would probably suit the Scottish Milk Marketing Board, which has already had its preferred option of single integrated co-op, embracing its marketing and processing activities, knocked back by the Government and the Office of Fair Trading."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the other hand, delay in implementing the new arrangements will give leading buyers like Nestle and Wiseman Dairies—who say they intend to source most of their supplies direct from farmers in future—more time to convince producers that this kind of 'partnership' offers them the prospect of earning higher returns for their milk."</p></blockquote>
The entire debate is entirely and utterly confused. I share the views expressed by my hon. Friends and am unconvinced that Milk Marque will not be able to abuse its position in the market place. I believe that the Minister and his team have a duty to convince the Committee and the world outside that the reason for abolition is not simply that ideology has taken over. The Minister must convince us that the Bill makes sense in today's market and that he will not replace a state monopoly with a different sort of monopoly. There is widespread concern and much confusion about the effects of the Bill. I know that both producers and consumers in my constituency are worried about its effects. I look forward to hearing from the Minister and being convinced that he has got it right. Many people are reticent about the Bill's possible impact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may recall, Mr. Hill, that the last time that I served on a Committee under your chairmanship was when discussing the Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill. I hope that, when this Bill is enacted we do not see the problems in agriculture that we have seen
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
exhibited in the fishing industry, round the ports of Britain over the past few days. I am sure that such problems will not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo many of the comments made by my hon. Friends when I say that the 60-year record of the milk marketing scheme is excellent and, probably, second to none in the world. By providing stability for producers, processors and, ultimately, consumers, the British milk industry has been able to innovate, especially at a producer level, to produce quality that is acknowledged as probably the best in the world. Genus and other organisations that have been formed on the back of the milk marketing boards have been able to transfer their expertise throughout the world. That is a great claim for British agriculture to be able to make but it can do so only because a statutory framework provided the stability for the necessary innovations to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent a constituency that, until the introduction of quotas in 1984, was recognised to be a prime dairy area. The disastrous way in which those quotas were introduced in Britain, especially in large milk-producing areas such as those in West Wales, had an impact not only on the farming industry but on general unemployment. We must recognise that the problem we face is one of quotas, not one of whether we should have a market that is unregulated, partially regulated or statutorily regulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main processors in my constituency have told me that they would like to produce 20 per cent. or 25 per cent. more cheese—that would add great value to a locally produced product—but they cannot get the milk. Small cottage cheese producers add an enormous amount of value—far more than that of the large processors—but they cannot obtain sufficient milk to make their products or to create sufficient turnover so that they can employ more people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we take steps to revoke the statutory scheme, it is important that we remember its success. When we discuss the Government's proposals to replace it with Milk Marque, we must remember that Britain does not have a good success record in farming co-operatives. It could be argued that co-operatives in general do not have a successful record in Britain. Some aspect of the British character does not want to co-operate all the time. Perhaps it has something to do with the short-termism view that industry has suffered from for the previous 20 or 30 years. I register concern that, by revoking statutory procedures, we may be throwing not only bad milk out with good but the baby out with the bath water, or whatever apt phrase hon. Members might care to choose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, because of the imposition of quotas and the shortage of milk, producers have some security. I am not saying that there is likely to be a radical reduction in the consumption of dairy products, but would people 20 years ago have expected such a radical reduction in the consumption of red meat, for instance, as has occurred? I am afraid, however, that we may see the evolution of an entirely different climate in which the protection that producers have because of shortages may start to disappear. If that happens, where will they go for their protection? Suddenly, the processors will have the whip hand, as they do in other areas or agricultural produce purchasing. Farmers in my constituency tell me that certain major food retailers are demanding credit lines of three months for items such as cauliflowers. The product is delivered but the producer is not paid for three months. We

have had stability and innovation in the milk industry because the milk cheque has always been guaranteed at the end of the month, come what may.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should tread carefully before they revoke the statutory scheme. I have great reservations and do not support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a brief intervention. I want to pick up on a couple of points made by the hon. Member for North Cornwall and other hon. Members about broken items and fixing them. I believe that the expression is "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." That may not get anyone through key stage English tests but I am sure that the hon. Member for North Cornwall knows that that maxim has caused many broken down cars on the road to his constituency. It is right not to try to deal with things as events develop and not wait until they break, and that is why I support the Bill and the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join hon. Members who have paid tribute to the milk marketing board and its work but they must realise that there has been an enormous change in the dairy industry since the 1930s. Although I cannot remember the figures, there were hundreds of thousands of dairy farmers in those days, and the average herd size was fewer than 16.I stand to be corrected on the figures but today there are about 39,000 dairy farmers who produce more milk than in 1933. Whatever the figures, there are substantially fewer producers than when the board was set up. That is why I think that dairy producers are ready to move into the free market, and they will move closer to the free market as a result of the Bill. I think that the restraints that the milk marketing board puts on the industry is stopping dairy farmers from moving forward as they would wish. That is why it is right to amend the system in order to have a prosperous dairy industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue the analogy "If it ain't broke, don't fix it", but if cars are in trouble and break, they must be fixed. There may be difficulties with the milk marketing board and with the entire subject but the problem with the Bill and the clause is that the instruction manual is extremely vague. All the levers and tools are in the hands of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. If I were a consumer, I would not want that to happen. I would want to know the history of the motor car. The history of the milk marketing boards goes back 60 years and companies of various sizes operate in the milk market. There may be difficulties in the market place. There may be some conflict and a difference of views, but people know how the market is working. To some extent, there is a degree of trust and understanding arising from the history of the milk marketing board.

If we return to the concept of the car manual, we are being offered a manual which has no vision or shape of the future for the new vehicle. That is where the difficulty arises. As colleagues said earlier, we are being asked to trust the Minister. Given the long history of the milk marketing boards, the transition will be difficult. I hope that the Minister will listen to the strong views as he has begun to do during the Committee. It is important in this limited market, where small companies compete against increasingly large operators, that we do not arrive at a situation in which people have no say and no power. It
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
appears to many people that the leap from a framework, no matter how complicated it is, to a new, unclear future is asking them to drive their motor cars too hard. I ask the Minister, please, listen to their voices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cuny</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) might know that I claim to be the listening Minister. I would not wish that to be known too widely because it might have deliterious consequences for my career. I tend to listen to what people say in Committee. If I think that they are right, we respond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The analogy that the hon. Member for Sherwood made with the motor car was very entertaining, but one does not buy a motor car with a plan of where it can go written into it. One does not buy a motor car and say that it will only go up and down the A1 or M1. I wish that I could buy a car that would go up and down the A1 by itself because that would save me a great deal of activity, especially as the road works appear to be a permanent feature of that road. Ferrybridge must be the spot on earth with which I am most familiar because I have spent so much time there being stationary. Any vehicle that could get me round Ferrybridge would delight me, but I do not buy a car with that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to all the tags that have been used. I shall try to raise the intellectual tone of the Committee by suggesting that "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" might translate into latin as "nisi fractum est nolite reparare." We might take advice on that from the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Mr. Enright) whose fluency in latin is demonstrated as frequently as possible. I should be willing to stand corrected by him on that, if not on anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington said that the Labour party would have preferred a halfway house between the old MMB and the proposed system by retaining some statutory framework. I now understand the thrust of his amendments. He is in practice trying to erect a semi-statutory framework. The hon. Member for East Lothian has accused me of being ideological, but he is promoting the ideological preferences of the Labour party for a system which is prescriptive with the laws written in. That view seems to come out in intervention after intervention. The Government do not intend to be prescriptive. The idea is to put the boards in two or three marketplaces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will have to be safeguards, as the hon. Member for North Cornwall said. It matters less what the sign up rate to Milk Marque is as to how Milk Marque behaves when it is in the marketplace. Our job as Ministers is to ensure that the arrangements which are capable of asserting that Milk Marque will not overstep the mark are able to function effectively. If that happens, the sign up rate, whether it be 17 per cent. or 70 per cent., will be less of a material consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill was introduced in the Lords. We wanted the boards to make proposals. I am the first to admit that the pace has not always been Napoleonic and that a little more urgency would have been helpful, but the proposals are before us now—that is what is important—and we know the direction in which we want to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always seemed to us to be right that disposal of organisations such as the milk marketing boards, which consist of the assets of milk producers should include proposals on how to move into the future. The boards have flirted with the idea of a halfway house and of adapting the existing scheme. We saw the attempt at a new way, but that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0021">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
did not work. I have no doubt that had there been a halfway house, the boards would have alighted there, but there is no halfway house and the only option now is to go into a new world—I have been overtaken by the Dvorakian phrases to describe the processes of incremental advance by the boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that producers want security and that their greatest security is to be in a seller's market. They are in such a market because of quotas. I do not like quotas because I do not believe that they are effective or sensible, especially if there are not enough of them. But we have quotas and they provide security for farmers, not in the strict pecuniary sense that they are worth something, but because they provide the seller with the advantage as buyers fight their way up the path to buy milk. Some farmers find that untidy situation regrettable and prefer to have one person coming up the path in an orderly way. But it is an advantage for farmers to have more than one person competing for their milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
why have we introduced these proposals? There is no fundamental disagreement in the Committee and we know that the market has changed. I do not want to embarrass anyone by asking for a show of hands of those who drink semi-skimmed milk instead of whole milk on their oats flakes. My guess is that a significant element of the Committee buys other than full cream milk. I would bet that even some members of the milk marketing boards do not take full cream milk on their cornflakes and many farmers do not drink it. That shows the extent to which the market has changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various challenges to the boards have not been resolved and the provisions will ensure that a residuary board has the function eventually to discharge the legal responsibilities that will come before it. When I hear people say that the milk marketing board system has been innovatory, I question where that innovation has existed. The boards have not been innovatory because they have not needed to be. I am not denigrating them. I accept that the circumstances leading to the creation of those statutory bodies nearly 60 years ago were different and that the boards served an essential purpose in rescuing British agriculture and providing the means for it to progress through a difficult period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Circumstances now are different and change is necessary. We are not discussing the arbitrary ending of schemes which are relevant to present circumstances. It is important to put the matter into perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into great detail on competition law because that will form a substantive part of a later debate. In reply to the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston), the co-operatives will be fully exposed to the Fair Trading Act 1973 and a significant framework of competition will apply. I have examined the areas in which competition policy will apply. Under those Acts Ministers have powers to prevent or reverse mergers that would be against the public interest, and they can refer to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission any acquisition that would create or extend a monopoly or would involve more than £30 million in assets. Ministers could also refer to the MMC any body with more than 25 per cent of the market that had abused, or had the potentional to abuse, a dominant position. If the MMC finds that a merger or monopoly operated or could be expected to operate against the public interest, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
Secretary of State has wide-ranging powers to deal with it. I can make available to the Committee a clear statement of the competition powers that already exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Workington mentioned, the statement in the House yesterday, which reinforced and drew attention to the Government's awareness of their competition powers, is relevant to the Bill. The Government believe that the dual guardians of competition in the form of the national regulatory authority and the Commission are sufficient to ensure against the circumstances outlined by the hon. Member for North Cornwall and ensure sufficient guarantee of non-abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission takes the view that low-fat milk is outside the board's monopoly. It has consistently refused to propose an amendment to the European Community regulations to bring it within the board's monopoly. Of course, it is not within the powers of the United Kingdom to change that unilaterally. The problems that have arisen do not relate entirely to low-fat milk. Other article 169 actions are pending or threatened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the belief that if no action were taken the scheme would implode that caused us to look ahead. No one could sit still and wait for the tent-pole to collapse and fall in on the scheme because there would have been chaos and people would not have known where they stood. It was essential to institute an effective new mechanism, even if the legal challenges are beaten off. The risk could not be run of those legal challenges succeeding. Of course, the more lawyers that are consulted, the more opinions that will be given about whether they would have succeeded. That accounts for the continued buoyancy of the legal profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it was the Commission's view that low-fat milk was outside the monopoly rights to buy exercised by the milk marketing board. Does he think that that was the Commission's view when those words were drafted? In other words, was it awaiting a challenge? Or did it, at that stage, generally agree with the interpretation of the milk marketing board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The interior workings of the Commission's mind are something that the hon. Gentleman will have to investigate unaided. But, as he knows the Ministry sought to assist the board in its discussions with the Commission in working out what sort of proposals would be accepted in Brussels. It would have been silly to have proposed a scheme that would have been wholly unacceptable to Brussels. Therefore, we helped to navigate those shores on the basis of the proposals put to the board. As a result, changes were made. For example, it was clear that Dairy Crest could not remain part of the co-operative. That would not have been acceptable in Brussels. I shall not speculate on whether it would have been acceptable to national authorities. The initial stage was to address ourselves to the status of the statutory monopolies as enshrined in Community legislation. That had to change, and other elements must change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, when we deal with questions about assets, Brussels has one perspective and there will also be a national perspective. As the hon. Members for Workington and for North Cornwall have said, there must be a substantive debate on that part of the Bill because it is significant. It is also true that although the Commission has said that it will give a sporting chance to the sort of proposals likely to be made by the board, that is not the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
same as having a free run. It is plain that were the Commission to receive complaints, it would be obliged to respond to them. It is not a two-year moratorium—a period in which the Commission says that in no circumstances will it reconsider or intervene. It is simply that the Commission will not by itself take proactive action if that is the scheme that the board proposes. However, if people complain, the Commission will be obliged to react. The idea that there is a period of absolute security is wrong. That is another reason for the board to be particularly alert to the mood that has been expressed in the House and in Committee when it brings forward proposals that relate to the disposal of assets. Although the question of the sign-up rate—what the hon. Member for Workington has called capping—can be dealt with by the reference to competition, the level of sign-up may be a factor that national and community authorities will want to take into consideration.

As for the future of quotas, I am sure that you, Mr. Hill, will not permit me to go too far down a track that leads to general Community agricultural policy. However, several hon. Members have mentioned the matter and I would like to outline the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the latest agreement put in place quotas that are effective until the end of the decade. We would like that system to be freed and for there to be trading in quotas. Quotas cannot be freely traded throughout the United Kingdom at present for reasons that may be perfectly valid. For example, there is a ring fence around some more remote islands in parts of Scotland. I want to make it clear that we do not have free trading of quotas in the United Kingdom at present. We would like, however, to see a freeing of the system and, eventually, the end of the quota system. My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South knows as well as I do that most agriculture Ministers in the European Community are attached to an idea of a quota system. They see that the limiting of supply permits a level of price that would not otherwise be obtained. That is why they tend to be attached to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I said that I thought that we were likely to see a change in mood over the coming years, I would be spinning a line. That would not be true. However, the Community will face a number of serious challenges. The one that people talk about is GATT, but I think that GATT may be less important in the medium term than developments in eastern and central Europe and the process of trying to open up the marketplace there. That will depend on the extent to which there is developed a marketplace within central and eastern Europe that can supply from its own means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in panicking, but if the Community is serious about giving economic assistance to those developing democracies, we cannot write out agriculture from the equation. A challenge will come from that area. None of us can foresee the circumstances but if one of my farmers in my constituency from the Craven tenant farmers association came to me and asked whether he should buy milk quota now or whether it would be worthless in a few years' time, I would tell him to buy. I have always given that advice. At the moment, I would advise farmers to buy lamb ewe quotas as the price is looking good in terms of the return. I have yet to have anyone try to charge me with loss
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
of assets because of advice that I have given. I am trying to be politically realistic, and I do not see a circumstance in the immediate future when Community Ministers will opt to dismantle quotas in the dairy sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I fear that his arguments could give rise to uncertainty. He said that he would advise farmers in his constituency to hold on to or buy quota, but conversely, the fact that it has been suggested at his level that the quota scheme might disappear in a puff of smoke by the end of the decade could encourage people at the borderline to sell their quota while it still has a significant capital value. That could have the effect of siphoning production out of areas where the market is delicate. There could be a very adverse effect on processing and producing industries in those areas. I ask him to be cautious in the way in which he deals with this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked two things: first, what did I believe and, secondly, what did I believe would happen. I believe that quotas are not the right direction in which to take agriculture, but that they are likely to remain. I cannot do other that answer both questions accurately, as I hope that I have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I commend the clause to the Committee—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue the Minister into the wider context of the European Community because I understand precisely what he is saying and think that he is right to say it, but are not there implications for the precise mechanisms that we use in the United Kingdom for the management of quotas? It is on that subject that we want reassurance and guidance on where Ministers are heading. The industry is entitled to consider the Bill as a distinct change of gear. We are concerned with the way in which quota is managed in the United Kingdom, rather than with its long-term future in the Community as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is driving at the fact that at the moment quotas are run by the milk marketing board. They will not be run by Milk Marque. There are numerous options—one is that they could be run in-house by the Department; a stronger option is that they could be run by the interventiion board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home-Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another quango.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intervention board exists, as the hon. Gentleman knows—I am sure that it pays him large amounts of money. That depends on whether he has filled in his forms—I am sure he will have hastened to do so. A great deal rides on it for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home-Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already filled in the forms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he has already filled them in. That shows how anxious he is, and I am delighted. Bearing in mind that the hon. Gentleman managed to get his forms in early, that proves that they will be pretty comprehensible. To answer the question put by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, who is getting at the details of who will run the quota, its management will not be passed to the successor body of the milk marketing board. We have not come to a final view on who would run it best, but the intervention board would be a strong contender because it has experience in all aspects of agricultural management. That is not the exclusive option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If what they hear does not inform its proposals, it will not be using its time valuably in devoting so much time to listening to our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 2, line 15, after 'board', insert 'or any person'.

At one of the earliest meetings that I had with the processors, having already met the milk marketing board and heard its case, which was ably put at Thames Ditton, one of the first questions that Mr. Haskins asked was why was it wrong for organisations other than the milk marketing board to put forward schemes for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
reorganisation to Ministers for approval. The processors have recently argued that they should have the right, along with others, to propose alternative schemes. The National Farmers Union might have wanted to put in a scheme of its own—I do not know. As far as I can tell, the relationship to date with the National Farmers Union and the milk marketing boards is such that the National Farmers Union appears to be generally supportive of the milk marketing boards' proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is entitled to know why Ministers are prepared to allow only a milk marketing board to submit a scheme for a successor body. I am told that the Government argued that the milk marketing boards have that sole right because of the complexity of reorganisation and that only they would be able to ensure that a successor scheme was successful in providing milk. I am told also that Ministers have argued that they might have had to preside over several schemes which were clearly nonsense and which would waste their time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that anyone who has been reading the farming press recently, in particular 	<i>Farming News</i> and 	<i>Farmers Weekly,</i> will have noticed that many people sent in letters expressing some support for Milk Marque. However, those people also recognised that alternative schemes for reorganisation could have been submitted. Some went so far as to suggest that England and Wales could be split up and that the proposed five regions for England and Wales might want to submit individual schemes to be taken into account by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One possible advantage of breaking up the milk marketing boards in that way is that we would not be confronted with the problem of Dairy Crest. A more fragmented successor regime would, to some extent, have met the difficulties that have arisen in Europe with vertical integration. The argument that has taken place in Scotland with the OFT is not one that Sir Leon Brittan felt necessary to address. He was prepared to waive through the principle of a form of vertical integration in Scotland because he saw the Scottish milk marketing board and its proposed successor body as small players in the national market and in the international market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If fragmentation of the successor body could have been a route to secure the survival of vertical integration internally in England and Wales, surely Ministers should have addressed the matter by allowing it to be placed on the agenda. The milk marketing boards will not submit it as part of their proposals for a successor body. As the Bill is framed, there can be no basis on which such a submission could be made and considered by Ministers. The milk marketing boards have nailed themselves firmly to the principle of a single successor body in England and Wales which will be Milk Marque.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
