	<div class='title'>RIGHT TO MATERNITY LEAVE AND RIGHT TO RETURN TO WORK</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 106, in page 38, line 2, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), where an employee has been continuously employed for two years by the beginning of the eleventh week before the expected date of childbirth, her maternity leave period shall continue from its commencement for the period of 40 weeks or such earlier date as the employee notifies to the employer in writing.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment needs to be considered in the overall context of the amendments tabled by the Opposition. The amendment is part of a comprehensive approach to the issue of maternity provision for working women. When allied to the other amendments, amendment No. 106 represents an important step towards a more generous and more easily understandable system than the current one, or the one likely to emerge from the Bill if the Government do not make further changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two main motivations behind the amendment are, first, to reduce the complexity of the current system and, secondly, to ensure that whatever new provisions are introduced by the Bill, there is no reduction in the existing maternity rights enjoyed by some employees. I hope that the Government share those motivations. At our Tuesday
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
sitting, the Minister spoke about the ways in which certain contractual rights could override some of the Bill's provisions. As I have only just had time to examine the report of the proceedings of that sitting, I am not sure exactly what he said, but I hope that he covered some of the concerns that we have expressed both in this amendment and those that follow it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 60 per cent of women enjoy what is known as a "right to return" for up to 29 weeks after confinement. Those women meet the qualifying conditions of two years full-time or five years part-time services. Taken with other amendments, amendment No. 106 would replace the so-called right to return by two definitions of maternity leave. Ideally, one would be of 18 weeks—although the Government still seem to want to stick to their 14 weeks—for women with less than two years service. The other would be a right to return of 40 weeks for women with two years full-time and five years part-time service. Our other amendments have to be considered in line with that general approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the force of the amendment and others that we have tabled would simplify the requirements of schedule 2 to the Bill. Were our amendment to be accepted in total, schedule 2 would be rendered unnecessary. The Minister should take that into account. We have been convinced by the arguments of the Maternity Alliance, the Equal Opportunities Commission and others that the current system is over-complicated. The Maternity Alliance has stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The attempt to fuse the minimum provisions in the EC directive with the current maternity schemes has been ill-thought out and will produce an excessively complicated system, especially if the provisions for maternity pay are taken into account."</p></blockquote>
It is true, as again the Maternity Alliance and other organisations have pointed out, that even industrial tribunals have criticised the complexity of the legislation. One judgment stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"These statutory provisions are of inordinate complexity exceeding the worst excesses of a taxing statute; we find that especially regrettable bearing in mind that they are regulating the everyday rights of ordinary employers and employees. We feel no confidence that, even with the assistance of detailed arguments from skilled advocates, we have now correctly understood them: it is difficult to see how an ordinary employer or employee is expected to do so."</p></blockquote>
The problem of the complexity of the legislation was referred to by my hon. Friends during Tuesday's debate. That argument is particularly valid in connection with this amendment, which would simplify the existing arrangements. It would provide a satisfactory translation of the European directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We suspect that everyone welcomes the extension of maternity leave to all women, though sometimes we doubt that when we hear comments made by Conservative Members. I hope that no one wants to increase the complexity of the system. All working women would get the 14 weeks maternity leave, regardless of length of service or hours worked, and their contractual rights would be maintained for those 14 weeks. Those women who have qualified for the existing right of maternity leave of up to 11 weeks before the birth and 29 weeks after the birth—about 60 per cent of pregnant women—would maintain contractual rights only for the first 14 weeks of absence. After that, contractual rights would be suspended and a woman would have to negotiate contractual terms with her employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
The problem is that some employers allow women to retain their contractual rights during the whole of their absence from work and others do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, I discussed with the Under-Secretary of State how far contractual rights would override the existing provisions and how many women would benefit. What proportion of working women are covered by contractual rights which would, in effect, be better than the Bill's provisions? The Minister implied that many women would be covered. Our understanding, from studies such as the McRae study on maternity benefits which was published in 1990 and is, therefore, fairly up-to-date, is that only 14 per cent of women would be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine that the situation would be dramatically different from contractual rights relating to other rights that an employee might enjoy. Will the Minister respond to that point, because it concerns us? The Bill's provisions, might mean that a woman's contractual rights would operate for only 14 weeks and that, for example, she might have to give up her company car half way through maternity leave. I cannot believe that that is the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem is that of the different notification requirements for those who qualify for 14 weeks maternity leave and for those who qualify for the right to return for up to 29 weeks after the birth. In both circumstances, a woman must inform her employer that she is pregnant at least 21 days before leaving work. However, the return date arrangements are different. If she qualifies for 14 weeks leave, she is not required to give notice of her return date, whereas those who qualify for up to 40 weeks leave are required to state that they intend to return and to give notice of the date of their return at least 21 days in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way to simplify that complicated situation would be to harmonise the rules applying to women eligible for 14 or 18 weeks maternity leave with those that apply to the right to return to work. The amendment would abolish the right to return and replace it with a right to maternity leave for all women, some of whom would be entitled to 14 weeks leave, others to 40 weeks. All contractual rights would continue for both periods of leave, a point that I hope the Minister will address in his reply. Identical notification procedures would be required in both cases. The whole system would be easier to understand and administer, which would be advantageous to both employers and women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred in detail to the view of the Maternity Alliance. Its view is endorsed by other organisations, such as the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and the Equal Opportunities Commission. As the Minister knows, those organisations receive a great number of inquiries about the complexities of the current rules. I do not know how many meetings the Minister has had with those organisations specifically to discuss those complexities, but it would help if the Minister could tell the Committee what discussions he has had with those organisations in an attempt to simplify and improve the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also be grateful if the Minister could give the Committee some information about the number of women who enjoy contractual rights so that we can understand the implications of the Bill on both women
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
who enjoy those rights and those who do not. We are especially worried about women who do not enjoy contractual rights, and upon whose terms and conditions of employment the Bill may have a detrimental effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the main points that I wanted to make in relation to the amendment, but I should just like to quote from the Equal Opportunities Commission's formal response to the Bill, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One important area of opportunity offered by the Bill is that of ensuring consistency with other legislation and, so, ensuring greater simplicity in employment protection legislation for the benefit of employers and employees alike. Many of the Bill's provisions represent piecemeal additions to various existing provisions, so making employment protection legislation more complex."</p></blockquote>
I believe that many organisations, which are concerned about the welfare of working women, support simplification of the current legislation, as has been proposed. The Opposition share that opinion and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. I should like to ask the Government future questions about the complexities of the current system. I should also like to ask them to commit themselves to simplifying it. That might make the practical application of maternity rights a reality rather than a morass of confusing regulations. There already exists an extremely complicated system of maternity provision which is not universal and does not apply to all women. The system is further fractured by having different arrangements for part-time and full-time workers and different entitlements for various lengths of service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) please sit down. Two hon. members should not be on their feet at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was referring to the complexity of the present system, to which the Bill will add another layer of complexity, the amendment would simplify the position by setting out maternity rights simply so that employees and employers know their entitlements and responsibilities. That simplification would be in everyone's interests and avoid confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two conditions for entitlement to the right to return to work, depending on which level of statutory maternity pay applies. The periods that apply to part-timers and full-timers also vary. Bolted on to that will be the minimum requirements of the European Community directive, to which the Government agreed. It is welcome that the principle in the Bill is that women are entitled to maternity pay without a qualifying period, but there are various periods of maternity pay for different systems. That is another confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Acceptance of the EC directive implies that the Government have accepted that women should be entitled to maternity rights and maternity pay without a qualifying period, so we should examine the qualifying periods and ask why there is a difference between part-time workers who must work for the same employer for five years before qualifying and full-time workers who must work for the same employer for two years. Now there is to be yet another system under which women will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
qualify straight away for 14 weeks entitlement without a qualifying period. The system is evolving illogically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already had ample evidence of the problem from industrial tribunal cases and the Equal Opportunities Commission. In the case of Woolworth plc 	<i>v.</i> Smith, President Wood of the employment appeals tribunal said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The complications and pitfalls of the statutory structures are such that the whole statutory scheme of maternity rights is capable of misuse and unfairness."</p></blockquote>
In another tribunal case Mr. Justice Browne-Wilkinson of the employment appeals tribunal commented on the return to work rules, which are also complex, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These statutory provisions are of inordinate complexity exceeding the worst excesses of a taxing statute; we find that especially regrettable bearing in mind that they are regulating the everyday rights of ordinary employers and employees."</p></blockquote>
In those circumstances, how can ordinary people and their employers, who want to run their businesses to the best of their ability, get through the maze of regulations and entitlements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the debate and the interventions by some Conservative Back Benchers, I wonder about the Government's motivation in introducing the maternity provisions laid down by the EC directive—on which, as was mentioned earlier, they abstained—in this manner. The Government's grudging and complicated introduction of the maternity provisions reveals their true motivation—that they want to introduce a technical system which would mean that they were not in breach of the EC directive but which would not be in its spirit, either. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) that if there were a free vote on clause 20, it would be interesting to see whether Conservative Members would support it. My impression is that the Government are having difficulty in carrying their Back Benchers with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Acceptance of the amendment would simplify the system and prove that my impression is wrong. The Government need to prove their commitment to maternity pay by agreeing that the system is absurdly complex and should be simplified. One of the ways in which they could prove their commitment would be to support the amendment, as I am pleased to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have tried to impress on the Government two principal areas in which maternity provision in this country is far less effective than it could be. One of those, which we discussed at length on Tuesday, is the level of maternity provision. I shall not labour that point today. The other question is the complexity of maternity provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one considers the various aspects of maternity regulations, it is hardly surprising that many women employees and their employers are confused about their meaning and application. The specific issue of maternity pay is not what we are discussing in the amendment, but it is relevant when set against the backcloth of the complexity of the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) said, qualification requirements are rigorous—two years full-time, five years part-time—to ensure a complicated formulation of maternity pay of six weeks on 90 per cent of salary and a further 12 weeks on statutory
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
maternity pay. If a woman does not qualify under those requirements and is above the national insurance threshold, she can receive statutory maternity pay, but that has implications for the first set of women regarding their right to return. If a pregnant woman does not qualify under either of those requirements and she is below the national insurance threshold, she could receive money through the maternity allowance scheme from the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is that the plethora of regulations is inadequate in terms of the level of support that is provided. There is no doubt that they are also highly complex and difficult to understand. That applies to pay as well as to the issue of the absence of the woman from work and to how that is described in the European directive on the rights of pregnant workers. The Bill contains the concept of maternity leave. That is a good concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) said, the maternity leave issue does not arise under the existing provisions. The question relates to the right to return. That is another complicated issue. Under the present law, there are rigorous qualification requirements governing the right to return. It is hardly surprising that there are so many problems with the application of the legislation. Those problems are likely to be aggravated, not improved, by some of the examples of employers' attitudes that Opposition members of the Committee gave at Tuesday's sitting We heard of irresponsible employers, who did not allow women to attend antenatal classes, who did not want pregnant women to work beyond the 11th week before the expected birth, or did not want women to come back to work after the birth, even when, under existing legislation, they had a right to return. A minority of Conservative members of the Committee on Tuesday expressed the view that the act of employing women was risky, because they may go off and get pregnant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept that such attitudes exist among certain irresponsible employers and then stir in highly complex regulations, under which all kinds of different documents have to be referred to and a detailed understanding of the law is required to be able to make sense of them, it is hardly surprising that there are problems with implementing the maternity scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The irony of the Bill is that while it improves maternity leave provision, the danger is that, as currently worded, it could add yet another layer of complication to the application of the right to be absent from work because of maternity. That complication is unnecessary. The current provisions could be unified quite easily with the new ones to be introduced by the Bill and lead to an overall provision that is not only more reasonable but easier to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of contractual rights, which has been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East, both the Bill and the EC directive provide that, for 14 weeks, a woman will have the right to maintain and accrue contractual rights—a measure that I welcome. The Committee accepts the logic of that provision. It seems crazy, therefore, not to accept that logic beyond 14 weeks. The employment implications are that it could lead to women, and employees in general, resenting what appears to be an illogical rule. It could also add to the administrative problems faced by the employer, who
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
would have to find out about an employee's entitlement at a particular time. Responsible employers might face fewer problems because they may have a well-staffed, well-financed and helpful personnel department, which will help them find a way through the morass of regulations. They may have personnel policies which acknowledge the silliness of allowing rights to accrue for 14 weeks and suddenly stopping them after 14 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, irresponsible employers, or those who do not have a well-staffed personnel department, will have many problems with the legislation as currently worded. They might be well meaning but, because they do not have resources to interpret complicated regulations, they will have difficulty applying them as reasonably as they might wish to do. Others may be unsympathetic to the principle of maternity leave and, therefore, might try to undermine rights, whenever possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ridiculous situations could arise. For example, a woman executive on maternity leave would be able to retain her right to a company car for the first 14 weeks but would have to return it after that. That makes no sense. The accrual of rights for the first 14 weeks, which both sides of the Committee agree with, means that the employer would have to make alternative arrangements. The employer would not gain by suddenly chopping the accrual of rights after 14 weeks. It makes sense, for both the employer and the woman, that the provisions are unified to ensure that contractual rights accrue throughout the period of leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same principle should apply to notification requirements. It is silly that different notification requirements could create two different classes of women. I hope that the Government will see the sense of our argument and appreciate the need to simplify the legislation in order to improve access to it. It is logical to unify the right to contractual entitlements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East pointed out that the Government were at some pains during Tuesday's debate to explain the importance of the application of section 38. That would provide those women who qualify under existing legislation with the ability to choose between the more favourable contractual entitlement or legislative entitlements. If that principle is accepted for those women, surely it would make sense to accept it for all women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several areas in which the legislation could be improved and simplified. As my hon. Friend urged, a major contribution would be to unify the two schemes, as outlined in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we consider the existing maternity provisions, there is no doubt that the law is extremely complex and obscure. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey referred to the comments made by Mr. Justice Browne-Wilkinson in the case of Lavery 	<i>v.</i> Plessey Telecommunications. I do not think that she completed the full quotation. Mr. Justice Browne-Wilkinson, having heard the arguments of lawyers representing both sides of the case, said, about the maternity provisions, that

Our amendment attempts, perhaps unsuccessfully but at least it is an attempt to clarify the maternity provisions. It is interesting to note the number of organisations that support us. The briefings provided by the Royal College of Nursing are of particular interest. If Conservative Members are concerned about the extra burdens and costs that could be imposed by such a measure, I recommend them to examine that briefing material. It provides the Committee with an important illustration of how the measures could be tidied up, not so much to impose costs and burdens on employers as to improve the working conditions of women and, in the case of the national health service, to provide substantial benefits to employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A survey on nurses conducted by the institute of manpower studies in 1989 found that 2 per cent of those who responded were on statutory maternity leave. If that figure is applied to the employment of nurses, midwives and health visitors in the health service, it suggests that at any one time, as many as 12,000 of those employees are on maternity leave. The sad fact is that some of those 12,000 crucial workers in the health service will not return to their posts because of inadequacies in their maternity leave arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Minister responds, it is worth pointing out that nurses employed by the national health service are eligible for a minimum of 18 weeks' unpaid leave. As the national health service is increasingly based on a system of trusts, there will be moves to establish separate terms and conditions for nurses in those trusts. It is, therefore, likely that NHS nurses will increasingly have to rely on the statutory entitlements. My reason for referring to nurses in this context is that they are an example of key workers being lost to the national health service because of the complex and unsatisfactory nature of maternity leave entitlements. The costs need to be spelt out: inadequate, over-cumbersome and complex maternity leave entitlements produce a direct cost to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A survey in 1988 by Price Waterhouse on maternity provisions in the national health service found that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Improved maternity rights would enable and encourage more nurses to return after childbirth."</p></blockquote>
The 1991 institute of manpower studies report found that the national health service employer faced an average cost of £3,000 when a typical, E grade staff nurse left the service and did not return because of inadequate maternity leave provisions. That figure relates only to direct expenses incurred by the employer in terms of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
administration, employing a temporary replacement, induction and training for the new recruit and so on. The figure does not include the wider costs borne by the taxpayer of the three-year training period before the nurse qualifies. That is a concrete example of how an improvement and simplification of the procedures would not be a cost to employers but would, by contrast, produce a direct saving and improve an important public service for the benefit of all our constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Committee—Conservative Members in particular—to consider the amendment as an attempt to improve the administration of the maternity benefits regulations, to simplify the procedures for the benefit of employers and employees and, in the context of the employment of nurses in the national health service, to improve the retention rate and the quality of nursing care provided, and to save taxpayers' money. I urge the Committee to give serious consideration to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept the amendment. I believe that it would increase employers' costs by giving women whose contracts of employment would not otherwise subsist during the period of maternity absence the right to benefit from their normal terms and conditions, save for wages, for a full 40 weeks. Under the Bill as drafted, a woman has that right only for the initial 14-week period of maternity leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would mean, as Opposition Members said, that, for example, a woman with a contractual entitlement to a company car would be able to keep it for the full 40 weeks, rather than for only the initial 14 weeks. It would also extend the period during which the new dismissal protections in clause 21 would apply, and during which a woman would be entitled to be offered suitable alternative work if she were made redundant, as provided in new section 37. The change is not required by the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister think it absurd that a woman would have to return a company car after 14 weeks, although she would return to her employment not that much later on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady says, "Not that much later on." In fact, it could be a further 26 weeks or six months later. I do not think it strange. If a company agrees to allow an employee to keep her company car, that is a matter of contractual arrangement between employee and employer. It would not be right for the law to require that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not claim that the provisions are entirely free from complications or that they will have no cost to the employer, but the hon. Lady's recommendations would deter employers from employing women, which would be counterproductive. We must strike a balance between giving women significant new rights and ensuring that their work opportunities are not diminished. It is wholly a matter for an employer to decide whether to enter into a contractual arrangement whereby a woman is allowed to keep a company car during those 26 weeks, just as it is for the employer to decide what other parts of the contract will remain in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would extend maternity leave for women with two years' service to 40 weeks instead of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
14 weeks that the Bill provides. Therefore, I say to the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness that the amendment would further complicate matters. The Department of Employment will produce guidance so that people may be clear about their entitlement and understand which provisions are statutory and which are contractual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give us his view of the directive's intention? Obviously, it does not cover existing legislation in Britain; it covers the 14 weeks issue. Does the directive clearly state that contractual rights should be maintained during maternity leave? Surely, if member states consider a longer period appropriate, the same logic should apply. Does the Minister accept that that is the directive's intention?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government will fully comply with the terms of the directive as required. We are incorporating the directive into national legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East asked me to say to how many women the contractual arrangements apply. I cannot answer that. The Government must lay down statutory responsibilities and that is what we are doing. The hon. Lady referred to one study that stated that 14 per cent of women enjoyed extra-contractual maternity pay. However, the Government estimate that at least 185,000 women each year will benefit from the improvements created by the directive, the employment elements of which are introduced by the Bill. That is generally welcomed and will greatly improve employment conditions for pregnant women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am alarmed by the Minister's response to the amendment. I expected him to be more positive, to understand the motivation behind the amendment and to try to respond to some of our anxieties. Several of his comments were alarming. He said that he could not give any figures on how many or what percentage of women were covered by contractual rights. It is astonishing that the Government are legislating without knowing how many women will be affected—how many will benefit or lose out—by the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand how the hon. Lady can say that women will lose out. The Bill introduces statutory requirements which are a major improvement. Any extra contractual arrangements between employer and employee are a matter for them and will continue, provided that they enhance the statutory provisions. They cannot reduce the statutory provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that is so, following the Government's response to the amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) said that the EC directive seems to want the maintenance of contractual rights to apply to the whole leave period. That must mean that women who at present are entitled to 29 weeks under the right to return rule are covered by the directive. The Government say that contractual rights will extend only to the first 14 weeks of the leave period. That may be contrary to the EC directive of October 1992. It would be worth while for organisations such as the Equal Opportunities Commission to test that in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>389</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not also contrary to the logic which the Government sought to apply to employment law that rights normally accrue with service? Opposition Members are not always happy about that. Under the Bill, however, contractual rights apply for the whole period of maternity leave if there has been less service and apply for only a proportion of the period if there has been more service. That means that there are fewer rights if there has been longer service.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. I shall reinforce that point by referring to the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, which I believe provides the right for women to have the same contractual benefits that a man receives if he is off work sick. There are various legal pegs on which to hang a strong argument against the Government's comments this morning. It is important for them to try to foresee legal difficulties and not to plod on with the Bill in the hope that there will not be difficulties when it is implemented. Various aspects of national legislation, as well as European legislation, could be quoted in opposition to the Government's comments this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that 185,000 women would benefit, but he did not break down that figure to show how many women, who have no statutory rights at present, will have such rights under the Bill and how many women at present are subject to the right to return arrangements. He did not break the figures down to show how well off or how badly off those women are. One of our anxieties is to ensure that less well-off women do not lose out under the Bill. We should like a breakdown of that figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough simply to say how many women would benefit when we have shown clearly this morning that some women with acquired rights may start to lose those rights. I shall quote the formal response of the Equal Opportunities Commission, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The EOC is extremely concerned that the proposals in the Bill to implement the EC Pregnancy Directive in respect of the timing of maternity leave could, contrary to the provisions of that Directive"—</p></blockquote>
I emphasise that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"reduce the rights of women who currently qualify for maternity leave (those with 2 years service (full-time), or 5 years service if part-time.)"</p></blockquote>
The Equal Opportunities Commission deals with such issues daily. The danger of existing rights being diminished has been referred to not only by the Opposition but by the Equal Opportunities Commission. The Government should respond to their concern more fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seemed to admit that the deal will not be welcomed as satisfactory by all women at work, yet the Bill is supposed to represent an improvement. There is an inconsistency which the Government have a duty to explain to us. My hon. Friends and I have raised matters of concern. If the Minister does not deal with them now, they will lead—I hesitate to mention vexatious litigants again—to a lot of litigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. DAVID KNOX 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help if I respond to the hon. Lady. There is no question of the directive requiring longer than 14 weeks maternity leave and the continuation of contractual benefits if a woman were not on leave for the longer period. There is also no doubt that there will not be a diminution of what is already available
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>390</span>
to a woman, if her contractual agreement provides otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 1(3) of the directive which was agreed on 19 October 1992 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This Directive may not have the effect of reducing the level of protection afforded to pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding as compared with the situation which exists in each Member State on the date on which this Directive is adopted."</p></blockquote>
We have shown clearly this morning that there is a danger that the contractual rights of those who at present enjoy the right to return would not be allowed to continue for the whole period. The slightly humorous example of someone having to return the company car after 14 weeks was a symptom of a more serious problem. I have quoted what was said by organisation which are worried about a diminution of protection and I am not satisfied with the Minister's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked about the extent of consultations—the Minister has not replied—with organisations such as the Maternity Alliance and the Equal Opportunities Commission. Maternity problems and questions relating to maternity leave form a significant proportion of the work of the Equal Opportunities Commission. It is important for the Government to sort out with those organisations any potential problems, instead of hoping that problems will not arise subsequently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady referred to article 1(3) of the directive. Everything in the Bill is wholly consistent with the terms and requirements of the directive and fully meet the provisions of article 1(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a previous sitting I expanded on the consultations that we have had on the matter. Organisations were free to make representations when we went to consultation on the original draft directive in 1990, and at subsequent meetings we have tried to accommodate them at official level and, where possible, at ministerial level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has confirmed our worst suspicions about the inadequacy of the consultation process, especially regarding this clause. I am sure that my hon. Friends are not at all satisfied with his response. I had hoped that the Minister would at least respond to the motivation behind the amendment, if not accept its wording. I hope that, despite everything that he said, he will be prepared to reconsider. Meanwhile I feel that I am left with no alternative but to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Where an employee's contract of employment provides for maternity leave or absence for a period greater than that specified in preceding subsections her maternity leave period shall continue for the period provided for in her contract of employment".</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief because many of the arguments in favour of the amendment have already been heard when we discussed amendment No. 106 which, sadly, the Government were disinclined to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response to amendment No. 107. It is similar to section 38 of the 1978 Act, which the Minister quoted on Tuesday morning. That section relates to an employee's contractual rights. It states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An employee who has both the right conferred by section 33"—</p></blockquote>
the right to maternity leave—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and a corresponding right conferred by her contract of employment or otherwise may take advantage of whichever right is, in any particular respect, the more favourable."</p></blockquote>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome section 38, although we are worried by the vagueness of the Minister's statements about how many women will benefit from its provisions. However, amendment No. 107 must be considered in the context of the other amendments that we have proposed to simplify the system and create two sets of maternity leave: one of 14 or 18 weeks and the other of 40 weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the difficulty that the amendment further complicates the law? Section 33 introduces the clear concept of a statutory maternity leave of 14 weeks. The amendment would introduce the additional concept of a period of quasi-statutory leave. In other words, statutory maternity leave would be extended by the additional contractual
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
period resulting in two sorts of statutory maternity leave instead of one. That would make no positive contribution to the law and would further complicate it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised by the intervention of the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald). I thought that I had explained earlier that we wanted to introduce two maternity leave periods of 14 or 18 weeks and 40 weeks and, by doing so, abolish the right-to-return provisions. The amendment is in keeping with that idea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I understood the logic of amendment No. 106, although I did not entirely agree with it. As that amendment was defeated, amendment No. 107 would only complicate the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North is trying to make us withdraw all our amendments. But, as I have explained several times, the amendments must be considered as a whole to make sense of the system that we want to introduce. I wish to speak about all the elements of our comprehensive approach. Although the hon. Gentleman may think that amendment No. 107 cannot be incorporated in the Bill, that does not detract from the fact that it is one element of our scheme for maternity provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, as amendment No. 106 was defeated, the Opposition should withdraw amendment No. 107 because it would only complicate the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment would not have been called if it were not in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Knox. I was going to say that it was not for me to pontificate on matters of order, however much I might wish to do so; neither should the Hon. Gentleman.
It is important to consider the amendment in context While I would not use that as an excuse to rehearse the arguments—I am sure that the Minister is delighted to hear that—each amendment provides a different aspect to our intentions, and I think that it is quite in order for us to refer to previous arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the motivations for the amendment is the concern that existing rights might be reduced. I have already quoted parts of the European directive which state that the directive must not reduce the level of protection afforded to pregnant workers in current legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Equal Opportunities Commission in Northern Ireland expressed concern on this issue:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In relation to the accrual of rights the position, under the Bill, is not the same during the 14 week maternity leave period as it is during the 40 week maternity leave period to which those with the requisite two years qualifying service are entitled. In relation to the latter group of employees new Section 39(2) appears to suggest that (with the exception of seniority and pension rights) other rights are preserved during the maternity leave period rather than accruing.'</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister address that point? The Equal Opportunities Commission in Northern Ireland goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This differential status in the employment contract is unfair, unsatisfactory and confusing for employees and employers alike. Furthermore it is the Commission's view that the suspension of the employment contract with the attendant loss of contractual benefits during the 'protected period' which attaches to pregnancy and maternity is unlawful."</p></blockquote>
That reinforces a previous argument but also applies to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0566">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
The Equal Opportunities Commission in Northern Ireland suggested that measures should be taken to rectify what it considers unfair in relation to accrual of rights. It goes on to recommend
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the Bill should be amended to provide that all benefits, including pay, to which a woman is entitled under contract of employment, are maintained and continue to accrue during maternity leave."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will take that important element into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would be brief because some of the arguments for the amendment related to previous amendments so I shall close on that note.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 20 already enables a woman, under new section 38 of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, to take advantage of whichever of her statutory and contractual rights is the more favourable in any particular respect. Nothing in the Bill diminishes the contractual arrangements or changes the rights concerning the 40-week period. The Bill provides a new right of 14 weeks contractual leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Women who qualify for longer maternity absence will, as at present, be entitled to complain of unfair dismissal if they are not permitted to return to work in accordance with the rights set out in schedule 2. Such a dismissal may be found to be unfair. Additionally, such women will be entitled to be offered suitable alternative work if they are redundant at the point when they attempt to exercise their right to return. To extend the full protection against unfair dismissal and the right to be offered suitable alternative work beyond the 14-week maternity leave period for those women with less than two years service would further erode the standard qualifying period for complaints to an industrial tribunal. Such a change is not required by the directive and would place an unjustified burden on employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled. Do the Minister's comments relate to amendment No. 107?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that they do. I was answering the hon. Lady's question about what the full rights would be by explaining that, on a wider basis, there would be no diminution of those rights. The longer period, provided for in the 1978 Act, and, in particular, section 38, will not be changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his comment and I hope that it was a reassurance. I think that we shall have to consider the matter in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Equal Opportunities Commission stated in its response that it was concerned that the Bill's proposals to implement the EC pregnancy directive
	<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of the timing of maternity leave could … reduce the rights of women who currently qualify for maternity leave (those with 2 years service (full-time), or 5 years service if part-time.)"</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister say categorically that this is incorrect and that the EOC has no reason to worry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I shall not pursue the amendment. I am sure that the Minister will understand
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
that those organisations concerned about the proposals will be aware of that response and will want to test it against what happens in practice. If those organisations believe that there is a problem—and they have made it clear to us that that is the case—I hope that the Minister will meet them and respond to their concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way. My understanding of the problem is that the EOC has confused maternity leave with statutory maternity absence. I stand by my commitment that nothing we have done will diminish the existing provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I point out to the hon. Member for Northfield that the hon. Member for Gateshead, East gave way to the Minister. If the hon. Gentleman wants to intervene, he must do so while his hon. Friend is on her feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard what the Minister has to say and those organisations which are concerned about the proposals will be interested in his comments.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where an employee is dismissed before the end of her maternity leave period by reason of redundancy, she shall be entitled where there is a suitable available vacancy at any time after her dismissal but before the end of her maternity leave period (if she had not been dismissed), to be offered re-engagement in alternative employment with her former employer or his successor or an associated employer under a new contract of employment which complies with the following subsection.".</p></blockquote>
When I opened this morning's proceedings, I explained that if our amendments were taken together it would simplify the existing position. By incorporating the amendments into the clause, schedule 2 would be redundant. One of the rights provided for in schedule 2 would be covered by the amendment. In order to be consistent, we have included the amendment in the main body of the Bill. It might be appropriate for the Minister to comment on this issue and commit the Government to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are a little concerned that the provisions in the Bill are less clear than the current provisions. I do not know whether the Minister will want to comment on that concern. Our amendment aims to ensure that the simplification process does not leave women worse off than they were before. We believe that if redundancy takes place and suitable alternative employment subsequently arises, it should be made available to the woman at any time after her dismissal up to the end of the 40-week period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want women who are subject to the 14-week period to have similar rights. There should be no diminution in

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
the rights of those women who are at present entitled to a longer period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seems odd, standing on its own, since the Government have not accepted amendments which would have tied in with it. However, the amendment allows us to raise that aspect of schedule 2 and, I hope, enables the Government to confirm that the existing system which deals with that aspect will not be weakened. The amendment is advantageous to the Government. It means that we do not have to spend time discussing that matter when, in due course, we examine schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have sympathy with the Opposition's wish to protect women on maternity leave from unnecessary redundancy. We have already done that by means of new subsections 37(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members, however, want to go further and give women who have been dismissed, fairly and properly, in a genuine redundancy situation, additional rights to be re-engaged at some future date. They propose that, even when a woman's ties with her employer have been severed fully in accordance with law, the employer, instead of considering whether she was the best candidate for a vacancy which arose later, would have to consider the circumstances in which her employment previously terminated, and those alone would determine his choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive imposes no such requirement and I do not think it would be productive to restrict the freedom of employers to recruit the best-qualified candidate for the job and increase their costs in this way. I understand the points raised by the hon. Member for Gateshead, East. As I said earlier, I do not believe that any aspect of the Bill will result in women having fewer rights than they enjoy at present. The Bill goes a long way towards enhancing those rights, as I shall presently show in the clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Minister. We feel that the amendment is important and that it would constitute a worthwhile protection for a woman who was made redundant. However, I accept the Minister's clear commitment that existing rights will not be undermined in any way. Many people, including those listening to our proceedings today, will welcome that assurance and will want to follow it up. I hope that the Minister will accept that one motive behind our push to strengthen this part of the Bill is the many detailed examples of employers who use pregnancy as an excuse to dismiss women, or who may not give pregnancy as the reason for dismissal but who want to dispense with a woman's service. In such circumstances, we do not want women, simply by reason of pregnancy or of having given birth, to be secretly excluded from reconsideration for new jobs or alternative employment. Consequently we feel that it is worth strengthening the Bill. None the less, given the Government's assurance, I shall not press the amendment to a vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be well guided by your words, Mr. Knox, but I think that it might be convenient to the Committee if I raise a few issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 20 makes significant improvements to the maternity rights of pregnant women and should be—and, to an extent, has been—welcomed by all hon. Members and, indeed, outside bodies. As we have discussed during our debates on amendments, clause 20 gives all women employees the right to 14 weeks maternity leave when they have a baby. This fulfils a clear manifesto commitment on which we fought the general election in April, as well as implementing the provisions of the EC directive on the rights of pregnant workers. That will be of considerable help to women who wish to combine their family responsibilities with a career.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Women with two years' service who work at least 16 hours a week already have the right to 40 weeks' absence from work to have a baby. This existing right—with minor consequential changes—is restated in schedule 2 to the Bill. It will continue in parallel with the new right conferred by clause 20. The latter, however, applies to all women employees, regardless of their hours of work or length of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 20(2) sets out the new right. It ensures that all women have the right to take maternity leave, during which all the terms of their contract of employment, with the sole exception of those relating to wages or salary, will continue. This differs from the existing right, which is a simple right to return to work and does not require the contract to continue while the employee is absent from work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made clear that maternity pay is a matter for my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and that he will bring forward his proposals in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had some interesting debates on the many amendments to these provisions which Opposition Members have moved. I have had to stress on numerous occasions that a balance needs to be struck between, on the one hand, extending the rights of employees and, on the other, imposing additional burdens on employers. That is common sense. If employers are weighed down with excessive burdens, they will be unable to create the additional job opportunities that we all wish to see, including job opportunities for women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Minister of State and I have concluded, on reflection, that we may be able to go some way towards meeting two of the concerns expressed by Opposition Members without imposing undue additional burdens on employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was much discussion during our last sitting about the scope for a woman to choose when to start her maternity leave. Under the Bill, a woman would, in most cases, be able to choose when to start her statutory leave. The only exception is where she has to take a day's absence for a pregnancy-related reason not of her choosing, such as a day's pregnancy-related sick leave. I can see that there could be a few occasions where this provision could bear
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>397</span>
hard upon a woman who was unwell in the later stages of her pregnancy and found her statutory maternity leave period beginning to run out before she would otherwise have chosen. I am all for giving the individual choice, provided this does not bear unreasonably upon the freedom of others. I will, therefore, undertake to have another look at the provisions to see if we can come up with a formula which would give the woman some additional flexibility to choose to remain on sick leave for a while after the beginning of the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth, rather than starting her maternity leave period so soon before the expected birth date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 35 of the 1978 Act provides that the maternity leave period will last for 14 weeks, unless it is extended because of the two weeks' compulsory leave after the birth or curtailed by dismissal. Opposition Members have raised the point that in a few exceptional cases, where a woman begins her maternity leave at the earliest possible opportunity and the baby is very late, the new provisions could be interpreted to mean that her leave actually runs out before the birth. While I do not think this would be a problem in practice, as a woman in this position would undoubtedly be able to get a medical certificate to cover the gap up until the birth and the start of the two weeks' compulsory leave, it was certainly not the Government's intention in bringing forward the Bill to allow even the remote possibility of statutory maternity leave running out before the birth. I am, therefore, happy to undertake to bring forward a Government amendment at a later stage to put the matter beyond doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not wish to claim that all the provisions are entirely free from complication. Nor can they be said to have no cost to employers. As I have said, these two factors go hand in hand. However, to go further down the road that Opposition Members have advocated would have created effects detrimental to the employment of women of childbearing age and would have been counterproductive. I believe we have achieved the best of both worlds in giving women very significant new rights while ensuring that their opportunities to work and take advantage of these rights are not diminished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that members of the Committee will join me in welcoming the clause and the announcements that we have made this morning, and the amendment that we shall introduce at a later stage to ensure that the changes that we have made will fit into the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his contribution and warmly welcome the concessions and changes that he has announced. To give women greater flexibility by allowing them to choose when their maternity leave starts is very important. We should have welcomed even more concessions, but we are glad that the Government have listened to some of the representations that have been made to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also welcome the Minister's assurance that he will deal with the amazing situation in which leave might end before the baby is born. We shall seek to facilitate those important changes. I hope that the Government will reconsider the question of 14 or 18 weeks. Although I have no intention of reiterating the arguments that have been put forward by my hon. Friends, I should like to bring to the Committee's attention some of the letters in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>398</span>
support of 18 weeks leave that I have received since our discussion on Tuesday. For example, I received a letter from the Working Mothers Association, which put a strong case for extending the period of leave beyond 14 weeks, which it believes is too short for both mother and baby. It supports the introduction of 40 weeks leave, however that may be achieved; whether by allowing 18 weeks, plus a parental leave entitlement, or by introducing a 40 weeks entitlement for all women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness briefly referred to some information sent to us by the Royal College of Nursing. It refers also to amendments to clause 20, which we discussed earlier, but we did not have the letter at that time. The college is strongly in favour of 18 weeks leave and describes in detail—my hon. Friend referred briefly to it—the good arrangements for maternity provision that exist within the national health service. It is strange that the NHS, which is part of the public sector, has good arrangements but that the Government are not prepared to introduce such arrangements on a wider scale. Indeed, the irony of the Government's position became clear to me when I recalled what the Secretary of State for Health, said in European Standing Committee B, of which I am a member, about the good maternity provisions in the national health service, while at the same time arguing against some of the provisions of the EC maternity directive. The Government should be consistent and, at the very least, accept the 18-week period that so many people want. The National Council of Women of Great Britain wrote to us about clause 20, saying that it felt strongly that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The new right is the minimum required by the Directive."</p></blockquote>
Despite the concessions, the organisation considered the period of maternity leave to be too short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall say no more about this matter. I felt that it was important to put such concerns on the record. It is not just the Opposition who have been promoting the ideas contained in our amendments—there is also a weight of opinion outside Parliament. The Government, who are supposed to respond to public concerns, have more to do in consulting organisations and the public. There are many more improvements that the Government could make to the Bill if they undertook that consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You kindly said on Tuesday, Mr. Knox, that some of the issues that I wanted to raise would be more appropriately discussed in the clause stand part debate. Opposition Members' comments have misrepresented what I was trying to say, although what I said in Tuesday's debate is clearly reported in 	<i>Hansard.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it unambiguously clear that I welcome the substance of the proposals in the clause and have no difficulty in supporting a provision that honours our manifesto commitments. After all, this Government have taken the lead with a range of employment legislation, especially as regards health and safety, in which we have one of the best records in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not, however, believe that the European Community should have any part in determining our labour relations law. I am concerned about the danger of creeping competence resulting from the pressures exerted by a former Greek Commissioner who is no longer a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>399</span>
member of the Commission, and from an environment in which that was allowed to happen prior to the debate and the resolution on the important issue of subsidiarity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to assure me that, if we support clause 20, we shall not prejudice the British Government's position in the European Community. I seek his assurance, first, that we shall not allow the Commission's creeping competence into our labour relations law and, secondly, that, having abstained on the directive, we shall not be prejudiced from taking a case to the European Court should we feel it necessary and in our interests to do so. I suspect that that will depend on whether the Commission tries to press further in the matter. We would wish to sweep that up with any future references that might be made. My reason for speaking was to set the record straight and to seek that assurance from my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still find it odd that the hon. Gentleman is talking about "creeping competence" when the issues that we are discussing are part of the treaty of Rome. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree fundamentally with the hon. Lady. She is trying, once again, to confuse the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hartley Booth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Creeping incompetence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, it is creeping incompetence. The point is clear. The ex-Commissioner, Mrs. Papandreou, tried to introduce a range of labour relations laws under the pretext that they were to do with health-at-work legislation, which was included in the treaty of Rome. It is important for the Committee and the House to give a clear message to the Commission that we are committed to the principle of subsidiarity. Will my hon. Friend assure me that, in voting for the clause, which honours our manifesto commitments and our judgments on what is right for the United Kingdom, we are not selling out on subsidiarity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. All of us welcome any advance, however, marginal, and I am happy to welcome the advance made by clause 20 in respect of women who have previously been excluded from maternity provision because of the long qualifying period, which will prevail until the Bill is enacted, and for other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have praised the clause, but with faint praise because it does not go far enough. I do not want to go into details, as you, Mr. Knox, would immediately rule me out of order if I did, but we have expressed concens about the problems involved in the implementation of the provisions due to the complexities of the system. I am concerned not just about those complexities but with the omission from the Bill of a provision to enable the burden of bringing up children to be shared between the sexes. Paternity or parental leave would go some way to rectifying that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our society has developed in a skewed way in that respect with women being left responsible for bringing up
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>400</span>
children and men being allowed to go into the world of work. Women in general have come into the world of work as second-class citizens with worse terms and conditions. They are usually congregated at the lower end of the labour market, with less pay, and virtually non-existent employment rights and career prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we examine the Hansard Society's report, we are aware of a glass ceiling between the sexes because, as a structure, our labour market is badly skewed. Further progress on maternity rights would rectify that imbalance and, to that extent, clause 20 is a disappointment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make some further comments about that balance between men and women. We have been discussing issues which lie at the heart of our aim to achieve equal opportunities, justice and equal rights for women in society, and we shall continue to discuss such issues under clauses 28 and 25. Better maternity and employment rights for women would give them more opportunity to realise their potential, and the country's economic capacity would increase as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Women constitute 51 per cent of the population. They have much to offer in terms of skills and experience. Those skills may differ from those for which some employers are used to looking, particularly because the job market has been so skewed in the past. I think that if we could unleash the potential of women in the workplace and in the world of work, in the higher echelons as well as at the bottom, we should experience a beneficial change to the potential of the economy. We have missed a chance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the implementation of the new maternity rights has been so grudging, we have lost a great chance to codify, simplify and overhaul the entire system. This could have been a great day for women, had the Government entered into the implementation of the directive with genuine enthusiasm—which, I must say, I have not discerned while listening to Conservative Members. Ministers have to defend what the Government are doing, but the enthusiasm is even less discernible on the Back Benches than it is on the Front Bench. Whenever Conservative Back Benchers speak, the dilemma facing the Government over the extension of employment rights is exposed. The Government have spent the past 13 or so years systematically reducing employment rights, so to have to increase them, however grudgingly and in whatever small way, runs against the grain for many Conservative Members. It has been interesting to watch them wriggling and having to deal with their dilemmas. Some have done it better than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we consider the other limited employment rights introduced by the directive, I hope that the Government will get better at dealing with the dilemma and that we can start thinking more positively about what we can do to increase the efficacy of our labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two fundamental approaches to the question of how to proceed in a labour market have been expressed. One is to level up and to increase quality of jobs and employment rights, to try and create jobs and opportunities that would facilitate training; the other is that quantity is all that matters—the cheaper, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debates have summed up those fundamental differences. I come down on the side of quality. A tremendous opportunity to make great strides has been lost. Allowing the advance of equal opportunities for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>401</span>
women in the work force would have been an historical stride. Much remains to be done and it is a source of great sadness to me that the opportunity has been missed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Opposition Members will keep fighting for progress. One day, we shall succeed and that will be all to the good. It will not only improve our capacity to survive and compete in modern economies; it will enable us to prove that we have allowed women to reach their full potential in the workplace and their lives, rather than being restricted as a result of the Government's grudging acceptance of the minimum possible rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) said, one of the more interesting aspects of today's debate has been watching Ministers being shelled by their own troops. It is amazing that the EC directive which Labour Members and many outside organisations have recognised as introducing the bare minimum of rights has resulted in many Conservative Back Benchers wanting to erode some of the rights. I was especially concerned at the comments of the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls), which came from the backwoods, to say the least.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause covers improvement of maternity rights. There is very little in the clause against which the Committee would wish to argue, but Opposition Members have argued that the clause provides only the bare minimum and that there should be an increase in the provisions to protect the health of women and their babies and to ensure a proper framework for fairness, justice and equality. The Government have missed a fine opportunity to set a standard which is not the bare minimum but which sets out a vision of how the future production of children in our society should take place. That should involve men as well as women in a fair and equal society in which women play their part but are considered to be not simply producers of children but partners in terms of employment opportunities, family responsibilities, parenthood and justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not against the clause, but I must argue against clause stand part because of the lack of advance in the Government's proposals. Many organisations and individuals have lobbied members of the Committee to argue for advances on the bare minimum that is proposed. The Royal College of Nursing, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, the National Childbirth Trust, the Maternity Alliance, the Equal Opportunities Commission—a Government-sponsored body—the National Council of Women of Great Britain, and many charities involved in disability, maternity and childbirth aspects all argue that the clause provides only the bare minimum and that it should go beyond the provisions proposed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a parent of three children. For 10 years before entering the House I worked with a charity which was concerned with disability. Prior to that I worked in the retail sector, which has a large female work force. Those experiences have led me to believe that the bare minimum in the clause is not sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about four matters which need further consideration and on which I hope that the Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>402</span>
will introduce further proposals. The first is the 18-week period. It is obvious that a 14-week maternity leave period is not sufficient and that it is the bare minimum. If women are to contribute by working until the latest possible moment before producing healthy children and later are to return to work in a fit and healthy state, they need a period of maternity leave longer than the proposed minimum of 14 weeks. The 14-week period would lead me to vote against clause stand part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that he will vote against clause stand part?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am saying that I shall consider voting against the clause. I shall not vote against the minimum provisions. I have already told the Minister that I support the provisions in the clause, but they are minimum provisions and that could lead me to consider voting against the clause because I want further improvements. We need an 18-week period. That leads me to have severe reservations about the clause. Therefore I hope that further legislation will be introduced in due course. It will not be long before a Labour Government do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should also give some thought to the question of antenatal care. As I mentioned earlier, I worked for eight or nine years for the Spastics Society, which helps people with disabilities. One of its campaigns was to fight for improved maternity and antenatal facilities, particularly for working women. For reasons associated with work, ignorance, time or pressure, they often do not receive proper antenatal care, which results in an increased risk of babies being born disabled. The clause does not provide sufficient support for women to ensure that they receive proper antenatal care to protect their health and that of their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unless we want to do just the bare minimum, we must strengthen antenatal care. That will help to reduce perinatal mortality and disability and, in the long term—an argument that the Government may find attractive—save money for the NHS. That will improve the quality of life of both women and their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To echo the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey, I am especially disappointed at the lack of provision in the clause for paternity leave. I am the father of three children. It is incredible that, as we approach the next millenium, we do not consider that mothers and fathers have joint responsibility for children. Women are not baby machines. Both parents have an equal responsibility for bringing up their children, for bonding with their child at birth, for helping with difficulties that occur at birth and for parenting. Fathers should not merely attend the birth and go back to work the next day. We need statutory paternity provision for both parents so that fathers can participate, at least in the initial stages, of a child's life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is especially important if the child's birth is difficult—as happened in the case of two of my three children. My first child spent seven weeks in a special care baby unit. That puts great strain on not only the mother but the father, who must continue to go to work. He cannot necessarily take annual leave, so he consequently suffers strain. In my constituency, people must travel, often by public transport, 17 miles to the hospital. If a child has a difficult birth and is put in a special care baby
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>403</span>
unit, it should be a fundamental right for the father to have time off to support his wife and look after the baby. That right is, sadly, missing from the proposed clause. For those reasons, there is room for further action by the Government and, certainly, by a Labour Government in the not too distant future. 	<i>[Laughter.]</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that Conservative Members are amused. I have been saying that since 1979, but one day I shall be proved to be right. The Conservative Government cannot go on for ever.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should argue for grandparent paternity leave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a wit. Do not worry. There is a Labour Government just around the corner—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> At least Conservative Members' reaction shows that they are listening—I worry about that sometimes. I welcome the fact that the Minister will reconsider the 11-week period. I appreciate the recognition of the validity of my hon. Friends' arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite that, I do not believe that the clause goes far enough. I was struck by the Government's argument that somehow my hon. Friends' amendments would mean that women would become less employable and that the proposed rights would not help to secure their future employment. If I had been in this place 100 years ago, I would be hearing those arguments about many rights that we now take absolutely for granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I had been a Member in 1975–76, I would have heard those same arguments against legislation introduced by Labour Members. If I am a Member in future, no doubt Conservative Members will again say the same thing. Every advance in maternity or employment rights will be met by such arguments. But, in practice, the advances that have been made have not led to the horror stories favoured by Conservative Members; they have led, instead, to a recognition that there is some justice, fairness and equilibrium in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the Opposition's proposed advances cannot be accommodated. They would protect the health of the woman and the child, support the family and the father to assist in bringing up the child and, in the long term, lead to a greater sense of fairness, justice and equality for women, men and our future children. Those advances will not be stopped by Conservative Members. One day, when we have a Labour Government, we will be sitting here—[Hon. Members: Here? Don't you mean 'There'?"] Sitting here in the global sense—me with my zimmer frame. As a 40-year-old, I shall be here in four years' time voting for improvements that I believe people outside the House would welcome and which would advance the cause of women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>404</span>
respect of a woman's right to a greater choice in deciding when to start her maternity leave, and to make it clear that in no circumstances should maternity leave end before the child is born.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo my hon. Friends' comments decrying the lost opportunity of providing real access to maternity provision. Time and time again—in virtually every discussion about the clause—my hon. Friends have stressed to the Government the complexity and the problems of achieving access to existing maternity provisions, let alone those that will be introduced after the directive is implemented and the Bill enacted. That is a problem, because the Government have done nothing to ensure that women can use the legislative provisions in practical terms rather than benefiting from them in theory alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a problem if a firm is responsible, but it is a problem in other situations. Until we tackle the ability of women to use the provisions as well as their theoretical right to use them, we shall be doing no more than to scrape the surface. The Bill has lost the opportunity to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area is the level of provision. We have discussed provision in Britain as compared with that in other parts of Europe—it is poor and will remain poor once the Bill is enacted. There is no reason why we should not be tackling issues of adoptive leave, paternity leave and proper parental leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no reason why the level of provision could not be 18 weeks. The arguments are clear. We heard no logical argument from Conservative Members, other than that of supposed cost, about why our proposal of 18 weeks does not make sense for the mother, the child and the family. We have also heard no concrete argument as to why the most fundamental issue effecting maternity leave—maternity pay—should be excluded from the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On several occasions during the debate, tempers have almost been raised between me and the Minister. Every time that I came near to getting annoyed, I was rapidly pulled back by the Minister's eloquence or by interventions from the hon. Member for Teignbridge, or, in some cases, of the hon. Member for Finchley (Mr. Booth) that gave me a greater understanding of some of the problems that the Minister faces in discussions with his colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the comments of the hon. Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste) during the clause stand part debate. Opposition Members have said throughout that there was no enthusiasm on the part of the Government to implement the directive—they would have liked to have got out of its being part of European legislation. The Government argued that that was not the case, but that their objection was that the directive should not be a matter of health and safety. The hon. Member for Elmet rather let the cat out of the bag by suggesting that the problem for Conservative Members is the principle of ensuring such rights under European legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concious that every time the Government say that the provisions should not be part of health and safety legislation but part of general employment legislation, they are also saying that we should have the right to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>405</span>
opt out of the employment legislation. If Conservative Members find it difficult to understand that we need such provisions for social reasons, they should at least recognise the origins of the equal treatment directive. It was not introduced because of any great desire to improve the rights of women per se—although perhaps it should have been—but to avoid distortion of competition. On that basis, which Conservative Members should understand, as well as for the compelling social reasons, they should revise their view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that the hon. Gentleman is arguing that there should be a complete uniformity of taxation of all forms across the Community. That distorts competition far more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was raising a point of historical fact as to why the equal treatment directive was introduced and why parties of a similar political colour to Conservative Members have not had the same difficulties as Conservative Members have had with the legislation. Why is it that in Britain we seem to find it so difficult? Why do we think that we can never afford provisions that are taken for granted and seen as part of the general political, social and economic landscape in other countries?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members have expressed non-specific concerns about cost. In conclusion, therefore, I want to spend a few minutes examining those concerns. In evidence presented by the European debate, figures were released which are different from those that have been bandied about in Committee. When cost was discussed, the burdens on employers were mentioned but few specific examples were given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government think that our proposals to extend maternity leave to 18 weeks would cost more than £200 million. However, they did not specify who would meet that cost. Even if that were the cost of extending maternity leave on a reasonable level of pay, the Government have failed to state that if they want to maintain statutory maternity pay as the basis of payment during maternity leave—a proposal which is not good enough for the Labour party—the cost of extending that leave to 18 weeks—which is what the Labour party wants—would be around £9 million gross. When flow-backs to the Exchequer are taken into account, that figure would be around £6 million. I do not consider that to be a great cost, but perhaps Conservative Members disagree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if we accept the greater cost of £200 million, that figure must be seen in the context of what, at the most conservative estimate, was a loss of £1 billion in one day in September by the attempt to sustain the economic policies of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Where do our priorities lie when such huge sums of money can be frittered away in one day? It is only when it comes to ensuring decent rights for women that the issue of costs becomes so important. The country cannot then afford even £6 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the Government failed to specify who would bear the cost. On the one hand, it seemed that it would be the Exchequer; on the other, that the burden would fall on employers. If the Government are serious about wanting to avoid excessive burdens on employers, and about their stated view that they want to improve the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
lots of women, the answer is not to soft pedal on improving the status and rights of women in society. The Government should accept their responsibilities and fund maternity provisions far more than they have so far been prepared to do, so that employers do not bear an unreasonable burden of cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have never responded to that point, nor have they revealed which responsibilities they are prepared to take on. What they say is, "Employers have got to do it; if they can't afford to, tough." It will not necessarily be tough on employers, but it will be tough on women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not good enough. The gender gap in Britain is perhaps the greatest in Europe. The gap between men's earnings and women's earnings in Britain is one of the worst in Europe. If we are to go into the 21st century in the right way, that discrepancy cannot be allowed to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the small improvements introduced by the clause will be passed. I shall certainly support them, but my hon. Friends and I do not think that they are good enough. We shall ask for improvements both on Report and on Third Reading. Women and—as my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) said—men deserve no less. We need decent parental rights in Britain. These improvements are a small step forward but no more than that. There is much further to go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spoke on the Floor of the House on the money resolution. As part of the learning curve of working in this place, I spoke in an environment that was similar to a football crowd because, once the 10 o'clock bell rang it became almost impossible to be heard. However, I ask the Minister seriously to consider the points that I was trying to make during that hubbub, some of whch I and my hon. Friends have already mentioned during the debate on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise for my absence earlier this morning. I was discussing the complexities of the Bill with some eminent lawyers. Reference has been made to the views of Mr. Justice Wood and Mr. Justice Browne-Wilkinson. The last time I appeared before the employment appeals tribunal, Mr. Justice Wood was sitting in judgment. On that occasion, he made almost precisely the same point as was made in Committee earlier today: that tribunal procedures are becoming inordinately and unnecessarily complex. It is our responsibility to do something about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to make that point when I intervened during the Minister's reply. It is reported in column 343 of the report of the Committee's proceedings. I tried to pin him down to a definition. He could not provide a definition, though it was clear that the Minister recognised that there is a problem. Otherwise, he could, presumably, have given me a clear-cut response. It will result in cases unnecessarily being taken to industrial tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take account of what was said in the debate on the money resolution and review the complexities that may be encountered by tribunals. I hope that he will consider also the number of cases that are likely to be taken to tribunals and the cost to the public purse. It amounts to a three-way disadvantage. The state will suffer as a result of unnecessary expenditure. The employee will also suffer. In those circumstances, a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
woman is placed in the uncomfortable position of having to take her employer to a tribunal at probably the worst possible time, so the employer will suffer, too. Employers constantly advise Members of Parliament—they have certainly advised me—about the difficulties that they encounter over unclear legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to consider carefully what I have said. We welcome the general improvement. My hon. Friends have pressed for further improvement. I shall not reiterate their arguments. When the Minister undertakes his review, I hope that he will consider carefully the financial implications for all three parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the man has not been sufficiently taken account of in our discussions. It is clear, as my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield said, that paternity leave would have great social advantages. It would have economic advantages, too, if flexibility were created in order to allow parental leave at key periods during the child's upbringing and at the time of its birth. There are advantages in improving social conditions. They create an environment that enables women to return to work at an earlier date than would have been the case, if the employer had not taken a flexible view. The matter should be considered from the point of view of the employer and the employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of the man leads me to the remarks of the hon. Member for Teignbridge. Perhaps I should not refer to the fact that I am a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology, but the House accepts that Darwin's theory of evolution is here to stay. The stone-age comments from the Conservative Benches suggest that well-established scientific facts are not accepted. I ask the Minister to discount such views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No account has been taken of the nature of our economy. Reference has been made to companies such as the Midland bank which has calculated the net advantage of proper provision. Both employees and employers would have gained a lot more from the clause if the Government had listened more carefully. The Government will find that they are faced with serious disadvantages, if the burden on industrial tribunals is increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to consider carefully all our arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hutton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My reaction to the clause is much the same as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey, who was disappointed. The Government had the opportunity to introduce an imaginative and progressive scheme, but, with their track record, it is not surprising to Opposition Members that they failed to do so. It is on record that all the organisations that made representations on clause 20 have urged the Government to reconsider several key aspects—the 14-week period, the amount of maternity pay, the complicated two-tier system. All those representations were systematically ignored by the Government. That reveals their true intention in introducing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned specifically about three aspects of the clause. First, the 14-week period is not enough. It is interesting to note that the maternity directive requires that legislation must not reduce
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the level of protection afforded pregnant workers."</p></blockquote>
Given that under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 pregnant workers enjoy the entitlement to 40 weeks maternity leave, there must be some question about whether the 14-week period would comply with the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Women take advantage of between 18 and 20 weeks maternity leave. It is clear that 14 weeks is inadequate in practice and might, therefore, be insufficient to give effect to the obligations in the equal treatment directive. It is worth bearing in mind that in the famous Hertz case, the European Court of Justice described the protected period in the equal treatment directive, which relates to pregnancy, as
	<br><blockquote><p>"the period during which problems due to pregnancy and confinement may arise."</p></blockquote>
The advocate-general in that case suggested that the period should be sufficient to deal with "the normal risks" and "usual complications" of pregnancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is arguable that a 14-week period in which a woman commences maternity leave 11 weeks before confinement, leaving her with only two weeks remaining after the birth, would not satisfy the requirement in the equal treatment directive. We have reservations about the adequacy of the 14-week period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we are concerned about the lack of contractual security for those who qualify for the extended 40-week period. The Bill's provisions for accrual of rights are not the same for the 14-week maternity leave period as for the 40-week maternity leave period. It could be argued that the different status in the employment contract would be unfair, unsatisfactory and confusing for both employers and employees. The suspension of the employment contract, with the attendant loss of contractual benefits during the protected period, could be viewed as unlawful. Clause 20 is a wasted opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reservations about the Government's intentions and are concerned about their failure to respond with the imagination and will required. The Government are doing the least that they can get away with. Most Conservative Members are not in favour of this provision. The proposals have been dragged before the Committee by a reluctant Government against the will and intentions of their Back-Bench Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the Government have not fully appreciated the benefits that could arise from proper maternity arrangements. I used the example today of the benefits to employers in the national health service of an imaginative and extensive scheme of maternity benefits. Conservative Members responded to that by saying that it would be at a cost to employers. Of course there is, to some extent, a cost to employers. We have always recognised that But that should be offset against the loss to a company—small or large—of skilled women workers who are unable to return to work because of the inadequacy of existing maternity benefit arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that there is a substantial cost to district health authorities and to the new national health service trusts when skilled nursing staff do not return to work after maternity leave. That is a cost and a loss to employers. In the case of the national health service, it is a loss also to taxpayers. It would be refreshing if some Conservative Members showed awareness that there is a loss to employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me develop the hon. Gentleman's point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon.

As the terms and conditions in the national health service break up because of the introduction of NHS trusts, it is likely that, increasingly, nurses will have to rely on the lower levels of statutory maternity entitlement that Conservative Members support. That would not benefit the national health servios—or even the new national health service trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confident of the benefits of the arrangements. I am not so sure that many of the people who will run the national health service trusts will be quite so convinced, because, as far as we know, most of them will be Conservative appointees who, sadly, tend to share the same narrow and ideological view on such issues as Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's views are reinforced by the European Commission in the impact assessment that is attached to the directive, which discusses the positive effect on employers and on competitivity of the arrangements that the Commission wants to introduce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>410</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that contribution. It is significant that we have heard nothing of the impact assessment from Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is arguable that there is a third and final reason why the clause may not comply with the terms of the European directives. I refer to the absence of any reference to pay and, in particular, to the strong suggestion from the Minister of what levels of maternity pay will eventually be. The Equal Opportunities Commission in Northern Ireland considers that the maternity directive may conflict with other areas of European law—in particular, with the treatment directive, the equal pay directive and with article 119 of the treaty of Rome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also interested to note—and I am sure the Minister is aware of this—that the Equal Opportunities Commission in Northern Ireland is currently supporting the case of Gillespie & Ors 	<i>v.</i> Various Northern Ireland Health Boards which is before the European Court of Justice and in which the same issues are likely to be examined and tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the history of jurisprudence in the European Court of Justice is anything to go by, it is likely that the Government will soon return to the Committee and introduce legislation that complies with the views of Opposition Members. There is a substantial doubt about whether the clause complies fully with the terms of existing European law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
