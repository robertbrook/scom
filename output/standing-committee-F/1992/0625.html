<div class='page-header'><h1>Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clause 1, Schedule 1, Clauses 28 and 2, Schedule 2, Clauses 3 and 4, Schedule 3, Clause 5, Schedule 4, Clauses 6 to 17, Schedule 5, Clauses 18 and 19, Schedule 6, Clauses 20 to 27, 29 and 30, new Clauses and new Schedules.</p></blockquote>
This change is in response to the helpful suggestion by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) and at the request of the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). Other information has been put on the Table and I hope that it will be helpful to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands <span class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the sensible and comprehensive way in which he has rearranged the order in which we shall discuss the Bill. It will assist our deliberations. I thank him also for the additional information, particularly the note on the comparison of cost figures, which will help us to understand the cost of the scheme.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 72, in page 2, line 35, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(8) Expenditure by the Development Corporation on the works referred to in this section and specified in Schedule 1 to this Act shall not exceed a total sum arrived at by adding to the sum of £85 million a further sum reflecting inflation in the cost of civil engineering works since November 1989, calculated on the basis of official figures published by the Department of the Environment.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>We may now also take the following amendments: No. 79, in page 1, line 7, at beginning insert "Subject to subsection (12) below".</p>
<p>No. 86, in page 2, line 35, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(12). The Development Corporation shall not commence the works until after completion and publication of a cost-benefit analysis of the works as a whole, and of each work itemised in Schedule 1 separately based on the most recent cost data and market forecasts available.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Just before the end of the previous sitting, I talked of the confusion over the cost of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
barrage scheme, which has arisen during the passage of two or three Bills, and of our lack of faith in effective control over the costs. An amendment, such as amendment No. 71, which deals with expenditure capping, should be included in the Bill.<br><br>
The barrage scheme was originally costed at £85 million. By the time of the Nicholas Bennett letter in December 1990, the cost had risen to £125.5 million. Within the year—at the time of the money resolution in November 1991—the figure had reached £152 million. The Bennett letter said that the £125 million price tag was set at 1989–90 prices, but that the outturn costs were estimated at about £147 million. We did not have an updated outturn figure for the cost of the barrage scheme until this morning, although I make no complaints to the Minister and I am grateful that we have it now.<br><br>
The useful and interesting document that we have been given shows that the outturn cost is not £147 million, as the Bennett letter said, but £ 167.4 million. That figure does not include £5 million-worth of expenditure because of the decision not to include the cost of the Wentlooge lagoons.<br><br>
The scheme which, by a combination of changes in design and justifiable pressures on the promoters of the private Bill and the Welsh Office, has escalated in cost, should cause concern to us all— <i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. One debate at a time, please.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that, in amendment No. 71, we try to cap the expenditure severely because we do no more than allow for inflation on top of the original estimate. We make no allowance for the additional expenditure that will be incurred as a result of changes in design and alterations to the scheme, which arise from the objections and pressures that have been brought to bear.<br><br>
Will the Minister accept the statutory principle that there should be a limit on the costs of the scheme? We think that such limitations should be written into the Bill. We do not have enough confidence in the Welsh Office's or any other body's ability to control the costs of the scheme. Given the history of the scheme over the past two or three years, we feel that such doubts are justified.<br><br>
We hope that the Minister will accept the principle, if not the exact words. The statutory expenditure package that we suggest is a first shot, but if the Minister accepts the principle, I, at least, should be prepared to seek to withdraw the amendment, although I cannot speak for my hon. Friends.<br><br>
Wider concerns, upon which we began to reflect during our debate on the sittings motion, are expressed with greater vigour in amendment No. 86. At our first sitting, my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) and I drew attention to the fact that the £167 million or £152 million cost of the barrage—whichever figure we decide to choose— is just part and parcel of a much larger barrage-related cost. I have not had a chance to read the whole of the note to members of the Standing Committee, but I do not think that it covers the figure; the note
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0211">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
relates only to costs arising from the Bill. In the debate on the money resolution, the former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, Mr. Bennett, reported that the barrage-related costs stood at £547 million. He estimated that £335 million of that sum would be financed by the public sector. We are not convinced that that ratio is stable or that those proportions are guaranteed.<br><br>
I draw the Committee's attention to a paragraph of the famous Bennett letter, which explains how the ratio of £335 million to £547 million was arrived at:
<br><blockquote><p>"The assumption in the January 1990 Update, which we"—</p></blockquote>
the Welsh Office—
<br><blockquote><p>"would certainly support, is that there will be a greater degree of co-operation between the private sector and the Corporation in bringing forward developments within the overall barrage strategy. This will result in greater private sector contribution towards investment in infrastructure and reclamation works including bay edge treatment, water features, landscaping and, possibly, car parking and light railway facilities."</p></blockquote>
Where have we heard that before? Was not that supposed to be part and parcel of the Canary wharf development? Was not there a belief that the private sector would finance much of the costs of the transportation system in the Canary wharf area? Is there any guarantee that what happened at Canary wharf will not happen in Cardiff bay? Do the Welsh Office or the Cardiff Bay development corporation have any written guarantees which would prove to the committee that the scheme will be privately financed and that the £335 million of public expenditure out of a gross total of £547 million is not wishful thinking—that it is not an assumption but a reality?<br><br>
I believe that there is doubt about whether the private sector will come up with the money on the scale proposed. Unless the Minister can guarantee today that it will, we will have grave doubts about whether the private sector contribution of £335 million is certain, given the property climate at the moment and the type of development that the barrage will be. If the money is not guaranteed, what method of control will be used? Will another blank cheque be issued by the Welsh Office, with the money coming out of the budget over which we all compete to meet our needs?<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will elaborate on the Bennett letter and the assumptions about the private sector contribution to the gross cost of the barrage-related schemes, especially those brought to our attention by the Minister's predecessor which he felt would attract private sector contributions. I do not make excessive comparisons between Canary wharf and Cardiff bay but, given what we know can happen when strains occur in developments of the size of Canary wharf, we have every reason to question the assumptions that were made in that letter about the ratio of public to private expenditure in the gross barrage-related totals, particularly as the letter identifies a series of projects, many of which I suspect will not attract the private sector support that the wishful thinking of the Welsh Office and the Cardiff Bay development corporation leads them to anticipate.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
Behind amendment No. 86 lies our belief that many of the benefits that it was assumed would flow from the large expenditure will not materialise. We began our attack in the previous sitting and we shall underline it forcefully. During the sittings motion debate, I drew the Committee's attention to the fact that one of the assumptions was a stable national and international property market. No one believes that that is a reality at present, let alone in the future. Every property commentator whose comments I have read now believes that a sea change has taken place in attitudes towards property inflation and values as a result of the experiences of the past two years. Sam Britten's article says that, if the United Kingdom commercial value of a property in 1983 was 100, in 1988 it had risen to 120. Do Committee members know the value today? It is 60—half what it was nearly two years ago—yet we are being asked to believe that every assumption made in the cost appraisal of the scheme in 1989, which was published in January 1990, is still valid, unchanged and incapable of being shaken by the volcanic eruption in the property market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's remarks about the international and the United Kingdom markets are relevant to the demand for offices in Cardiff, which affects the scheme's viability and, therefore, the amendment. Will he comment on the letter of 4 June in the <i>Western Mail</i> from Mr. Lindsay Williams, senior partner of the Robertson Francis Partnership architects in Cardiff, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The danger, surely, is that Cardiff might be facing a mini Canary Wharf situation"—</p></blockquote>
perhaps we could call it a Budgie Wharf situation in Wales—
<br><blockquote><p>"and until there is a dramatic improvement in both demand and office rentals, the situation for developers with office space on their books can only get worse."</p></blockquote>
10.45 am<br><br>
The previous paragraph of the letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The very few potential incoming tenants are very much aware of the continuing downward pressure of rental levels and whilst this situation carries on, financial institutions are hardly likely to back developers—indeed those that have, probably wish they had not."</p></blockquote>
Will my hon. Friend reflect on the relevance of that letter to Cardiff, and not merely on the international redevelopment of New York, Toronto and east London docklands?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is, as always, perceptive. Unfortunately, he anticipated rather effectively what I was about to say. If there is an overhang of a different attitude towards property values and future property inflation, the detailed assumptions upon which the whole benefit side of the economic appraisal is based give us reason to question and cause for doubt.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has quoted from an interesting letter by someone who is acknowledged in Cardiff as distinguished. I note with equal interest that, in today's <i>Western Mail,</i> there is a vigorous rebuttal of that evidence by Messrs. Cook and Arkwright and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0212">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
others in the Cardiff property game. There is certainly a lively debate in Cardiff on the impact of forthcoming change. No one can believe that nothing has happened; that change has not occurred or is likely not to occur; and that assumptions made in January 1990 are not in doubt.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will not simply stage that the assessments in the 1990 economic appraisal were robust. The debate on the Cardiff property market is robust, as evidenced by the letter that my hon. Friend drew to our attention and today's correspondence in the <i>Western Mail.</i> Those issues are vital to the question of the supposed benefits that will result from public expenditure on the scheme, and relevant to amendment No. 86.<br><br>
One issue which arises from my hon. Friend's point is that of future office need, value and rentals in Cardiff, upon which so much of the docklands scheme depends. The 1990 economic appraisal made the assumption that the demand for office floor space in Cardiff bay will probably average about 230,000 sq ft per annum. That is about 70 per cent of Cardiff s total. The assumption is that there will be an increase of 230,000 sq ft in office space per annum, from which all the benefits of the scheme are supposed to derive. The understatement of the year follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is a considerable increase on the city's own target."</p></blockquote>
In other words, it is an enormous addition to the city's present limit, which is, I think, hopeful thinking rather than detailed assessment, because I have not found any such assessment. That assumption was made at the tail end of a two or three-year period in which office rents in Cardiff nearly doubled, as one of the signatories of today's letter in the <i>Western Mail</i> pointed out.<br><br>
When a Bill was presented to the House of Lords in 1988, it was assumed that office rentals would be about £8 per sq ft. It is now assumed that they will be £16 per sq ft. A doubling of the rental charge has been built into the assumptions. Is it envisaged that that will continue? It seems that that is what is frequently believed will happen to demand and, thus, the potential return on investments.<br><br>
Rather than thinking aloud and giving our assumptions about rental charges, we can illustrate one practical way to test the market. Will the Minister tell us about the nature of the agreement that was struck between what was the Welsh Health Technical Services Authority, now the Welsh Health Common Services Authority, which, critically, has been moved to the docks to try to get the bay scheme going? The WHCSA is to Cardiff bay what Marsham street will be to Canary Wharf. What rental was agreed and what arrangements were made in that deal? How hard a bargain did the Government drive at a time when the market was—flat, as it still is—the best possible time for the renter? what were the terms? What sweeteners were offered to attract and encourage such public investment?<br><br>
The investment could have gone elsewhere. Indeed, there were many suggestions that it should. Some of us had ideas about that, but the investment went to the Cardiff bay scheme. Are we talking about a loss leader to encourage the rest to follow? Or has a good hard bargain been driven? When the Minister
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
replies, we will have a perfect illustration, in practical terms, of what whoever negotiated those terms—the Government or the Property Services Agency thought rents should be. I am interested to know the answer, and I think that the Committee will be interested to know it, because it will help our debate. Wherever we stand, we know one thing: huge and fundamental gaps hang over the costs and benefits of the scheme.<br><br>
I do not normally associate the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds with economists—it seems to be a contradiction in terms—but the RSPB recently published a very interesting report which was prepared by an economist, Miss Jacqueline Mallender. I do not know her, so I cannot testify to her qualities or abilities. As I said, the RSPB is not normally associated with detailed economic analysis of property values.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Miss Jacqueline Mallender was a Treasury economist before retiring from her civil service career and becoming, as many people do today, a consultant. At one time I was a Government economist in the Department of Trade and Industry and I can vouch for the fact that Treasury economists are no pushover.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure, from my experience of the Treasury, whether that gives me comfort or encourages me to rest my case more strongly on Miss Mallender's report. At least it shows that she has a worthy pedigree in the area of analysis. When we reach clause 28 my hon. Friend may want to draw close attention to that report. My point is that it states that, as a result of the changes in the property market, the Cardiff bay values are negative, not positive. The report claims that property values have swung dramatically from being hugely positive in earlier reports to being almost negative—a challenging, alternative view. Therefore, we cannot make any of the assumptions that were made in 1990 to justify the public expenditure and predict the benefits that will flow from it; we simply do not know. The Government have not given us the update for which we asked on Tuesday and for which we ask again in amendment No. 86. We do not believe that we should proceed and endorse further public expenditure unless we are given a re-analysis of the costs and benefits of the scheme.<br><br>
If the measure had come from the Labour party, I would understand it. We are, by nature, public-investment led. But the Government have refused to put a penny into the channel tunnel. Indeed, they introduced a Bill to say, "Thou shalt not spend one penny of public money on building a channel tunnel." That attitude came out of the ideological and political school of the 1980s. All railway schemes that flow from that measure must finance themselves as best they can. The Government are also trumpeting the fact that the second Severn bridge will be privately financed and run. Yet they are prepared to put large sums of public money into a marina in Cardiff, which most of us regard as of largely marginal benefit. There is no logical line of thought. If the Bill were post-Thatcher or neo-Major, I would understand it, but it straddles both eras. I cannot work it out even in terms of the lurch in Conservative party thinking.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0213">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
There are other schemes fundamental to the nation's infrastructure needs. Whatever you and I may think about the European Community, Mr. Winterton, we would not deny the channel tunnel's national and international significance. That Bill came before Parliament with a clause forbidding any public expenditure. Yet we are considering a barrage scheme to build a marina—which some of my hon. Friends believe will be covered in algae and will cause midge infestation—to obtain a waterfront appearance and we shall pay huge sums of public money for it.<br><br>
I do not think that it is because of the politics of envy that a valleys Member such as myself compares costs. The money is coming from the same pool in which we all fish.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth intervened—eloquently and effectively, as always—in my speech on Tuesday and said that the £90 million, one-and-a-quarter mile road would avoid social divisiveness and save a community. I warmed to the case that he made. But that same pool contains the possibility of making a dual carriageway of the entire heads of the valleys road, the most vital social and economic artery of the valleys community. That £90 million could have enabled two thirds of the 25-mile stretch of the heads of the valleys road to be dualled.<br><br>
We have to ask what are the comparative benefits. Given the doubts raised by the scheme's growing cost, which we seek, in one way or another, to cap— only in principle in amendment No. 71—and given the benefit, which is questionable, at best, that will flow from such public expenditure as a result of the changed market, I believe that amendment No. 71 and certainly amendment No. 86 are justified.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams <span class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney in his comments on amendments Nos. 71, 86 and 72.<br><br>
Amendment No. 72 is a probing amendment designed to restrain expenditure to something like the £85 million based on the November 1989 index. Amendment No. 86 calls for a cost-benefit analysis— an up-to-date economic appraisal. All the facts and figures before us are based on assumptions made in 1989–90.<br><br>
On Tuesday, my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen quoted the remarks made by Nicholas Bennett in the debate on 25 November, which were recorded in <i>Hansard</i> at column 728. Mr. Bennett said that the scheme would cost £547 million, of which £237 million would come from the development corporation, and of which more than £335 million would be public money. That is an enormous tranche of public money, which would otherwise be available to other parts of the Welsh economy. Is that sum index-linked—is inflation taken into account—or is there a cost-plus-inflation commitment so that the public are effectively signing a blank cheque? The outturn may mean that the contribution fromthe public purse is £400 million or even £500 million.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
The justification given is that the scheme will prime masses of private investment. As my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has just said, the Labour party believes in intervention to stimulate private investment far more than the Government do, but I question the assumptions made in 1989–90 very seriously.<br><br>
I notice that, in the Library's research note on the Bill, the leverage of private sector investment is assumed to be 7:1—it is assumed that, for every £1 of public money the scheme will attract £7 of private investment. After two years of recession, with no end in sight, negative growth for seven successive quarters, that assumption is way off the mark.<br><br>
The <i>South Wales Echo</i> of 17 December 1990 wrote that £2 billion of private investment would generate:
<br><blockquote><p>"over 10 to 15 years 24,000 jobs".</p></blockquote>
It would be marvellous were that true, but I have to point out that 24,000 jobs at a cost of £2 billion would cost £80,000 each. It would be the most expensive job creation scheme ever. The Labour party cannot believe that the 7:1 multiplier will ever materialise in an economy which is a recession—even a slump.<br><br>
We have heard comparisons with Canary Wharf. That ill-fated docklands venture should serve as a tremendous warning. Back in 1988–89, in the early debates on the barrage, a degree of optimism may have been justified. In today's climate, however, with our experience of Canary Wharfs collapse, there is no reason to feel optimistic about the proposed scheme.<br><br>
We desperately need the new cost-benefit analysis proposed in amendment No. 86. It would be irresponsible of the Government to proceed with this project without a 1992 revision of the assumptions that were made in 1989.<br><br>
I have another quarrel with the scheme. It is proposed that the scheme will create 24,000 jobs— and I hope that, with that kind of money, it will— but what kind of jobs will they be? The Library's research note on the barrage scheme says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The regeneration strategy for the bay envisages that private sector investment will be attracted for the construction of harbours and marinas, shopping centres, commercial offices, schools and hospitals, industrial and high technology estates, tourist and cultutal attractions, leisure amenities and housing. It is estimated that the barrage scheme would enable some 5,000 residential units to be built, of which around a quarter will be 'social housing' available for rent."</p></blockquote>
Almost all the investment is in the service sector, and in London and the south-east, the service sector has suffered the most severe job losses during the past one to two years, although it initially provided yuppie jobs for a year or two. Early in the recession some Conservative Members representing constituencies in London and the south-east said that some private sector jobs should never have been created. The jobs that will be created by the barrage scheme are in the recession-led service sector. There would have been a justification for such jobs between 1987 and 1989 when there was economic prosperity, but in 1992 they are disappearing in the south and the south east, which is why the unemployment rate has increased faster there than in the rest of the country.<br><br>

Britain's main problem is its lack of a manufacturing base and south Wales used to be a strong manufacturing economy. Britain will not pull out of the recession until we correct our balance of payments deficit which shows a yawning gap in the manufacturing sector. There is no macro-economic reason for investing large tranches of public money in the service sector at this stage in the economic cycle. The money should be put into industry to create manufacturing jobs.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Owen Jones) drew my attention to unemployment in Cardiff, especially in his constituency. The May 1992 unemployment figures show that Cardiff, Central has the unfortunate distinction of being at the top of the league with 4,772 people unemployed. Cardiff, West has the second highest unemployment figure of 4,712. Cardiff can claim three of the top four unemployment figures in the Welsh unemployment league—Pembroke claims the fourth. Cardiff, West, Cardiff, South and Penarth and Cardiff, Central have serious unemployment problems. That had not occurred to me. I thought that rural Wales and the industrial valleys had suffered most from unemployment and that Cardiff was relatively well off. I have learnt a lesson and I thank the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central for drawing my attention to the severe economic problems in Cardiff.<br><br>
If the barrage scheme went ahead and we invested £335 million of public money in it and it attracted £2,000 million from the public sector, and assuming that these predictions are right—I challenge each one—are 25,000 jobs in the Cardiff area really wanted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course my hon. Friend would want them, and ideally I would also want jobs in Carmarthen and in west Wales—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Pigs might fly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, pigs might fly. There are serious unemployment problems, but the figure of 25,000 jobs is out of scale. The barrage bay jobs would attract people from within a 10, 20 or 30 mile radius of Cardiff—like bees around a honey pot—but 25,000 jobs are many more than the south Glamorgan economy requires.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recognise that well over half of the jobs in Cardiff are taken up by people who live outside the city? If 25,000 jobs were created in the city, we should not look at them as only for people who live in Cardiff. Will he also note that it is not just in terms of the number of unemployed that three of the Cardiff constituencies rank in the top four areas of unemployment? In percentage terms, too, Cardiff constituencies have the highest, the third highest and the fifth highest rates in Wales. Surprisingly, the highest valley constituency is fourth—that is Cynon Valley, Merthyr is seventh, and others are eleventh,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
sixteenth and eighteenth. There has been a historic change in the unemployment blackspots in Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was a most interesting intervention, but it was rather too long. Interventions are used to solicit additional information or to clarify a point, not to make a minor speech. The hon. Gentleman could make his points in a speech should he seek to catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central for his comments with which I largely agree. However, I appeal to his sense of altruism and of socialism as we need the jobs all over Wales. I live 65 miles away from Cardiff and, unfortunately, the project will bring very few jobs in my constituency. A lot of money has been diverted from the rest of Wales to Cardiff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I draw my hon. Friend's attention to a recent report which stated, first, that in the 1980s, 11,000 jobs were created in south Glamorgan while 17,000 jobs were lost in mid Glamorgan? It stated, secondly, that two thirds of the jobs created since 1984 in valley communities are part-time jobs and, thirdly, that in the next decade we will have a jobs gap of between 15,000 and 20,000 jobs at least. It is envisaged that there will be an extra 25,000 jobs in the Cardiff area. The valleys do not wish to become suburbia; we want a vigorous economy of our own.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree and note that on Tuesday my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney talked about economic convergence, a concept which is in the EC's Maastricht treaty. Over the past 10 years in mid and south Glamorgan there has been divergence and this project will multiply it by a factor of two or three.<br><br>
The £335 million needs to be spread throughout the Welsh economy. There is a myth that the money will come from the Treasury and bypass the Welsh Office, and that otherwise Wales would not get it. That is not the case. The money will come from the Welsh Office. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney said so earlier and my right hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies) made that crystal clear in an excellent speech in February 1989.<br><br>
The Library research note states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The estimated cost of whole project is £152.5 million, which will be borne by the Welsh Office."</p></blockquote>
The money will come from Welsh Office funds and it could otherwise be used for the dual carriageway for the heads of the valleys road that my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney spoke about, or for the desperately-needed eastern bypass for Carmarthen, or for a new school—Ysgol Bro Myrddin—Carmarthen, which is also desperately needed, or for hospitals, schools and attracting industry into south Wales. We are losing that money which will all be diverted to Cardiff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend rightly says that there is one pot of money, which is given to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0215">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
Welsh Office by the Treasury and which the Welsh Office can spend on what it wants—barrages, schools, highways or whatever. Can he confirm that that has been the case since the first year that the Conservatives came to office? That change was at the insistence of the then hon. Member for Pembroke, now Lord Crickhowell and it enables the Secretary of State to switch expenditure between the different sectors. Until 1980, that was not the case and the Treasury had to make separate headings for the Welsh Office. It was not possible to divert money from, for example, barrages to roads, or vice versa.</span></p>
<p>11.15am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West for those comments.<br><br>
There is just one pot of money to be spent in Wales on our economy in general. Carmarthen town is relatively prosperous, with low unemployment, but other areas are not. The upper Amman valley, for example, is as deprived as any area in Wales, with unemployment, low pay and poor housing among other indicators. How do I justify to my constituents in the Amman valley the support of a Welsh Office policy which would spend £335 million in one small geographical area, when they are desperate for such funds for the improvement of the infrastructure and to attract new industry?<br><br>
Amendment No. 72 would cap public spending. It is probing amendment to obtain more information on the cost of the barrage. Surely the Government should be obliged to provide the information asked for in amendment No. 86, not only for the Committee and the House, but for the people of Wales. Will the £335 million be money well spent? We need an up-to-date cost-benefit analysis. I think that the barrage is a white elephant. The recession has lasted two years and could last another two or three. We could be faced with several years of very slow growth. How can that money be justified? The £335 million for the Welsh economy should be invested to produce jobs throughout the Principality, rather than service jobs, which do nothing for our balance of payments. We should use the money to improve the infrastructure of Wales and develop more industrial jobs there. That will hold Britain in better stead in the world economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I deal with the specific issues raised, I shall talk about the financial estimates.<br><br>
I have circulated a table of the main financial figures in response to hon. Members' requests. It updates the figures in the letter that my predecessor sent to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and explains the changes in costs between the private Bill and the Government Bill.<br><br>
Many figures have been quoted in connection with the Bill. That shows not a lack of control, but that we are dealing with a complex project, whose passage through Parliament has taken a long time—many would say too long.<br><br>
There are four distinct works in the Bill. There are another two which were in the Bill but which have now been removed. In addition, there is the related
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
expenditure on, for example, groundwater protection, and, beyond that, there are the costs associated with the general regeneration of the Cardiff bay area, such as the peripheral distributor road.<br><br>
Construction cost inflation indices are produced quarterly, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, West said on Tuesday. A number of changes and improvements have been made to the barrage plans as they have been developed. Many figures have, therefore, been produced, but there is nothing wrong with that—they have all had their purpose. If the Committee is to achieve an understanding of the costs and to assure itself that those costs are understood and under control, it will be necessary to concentrate on the key figures and to resist being drawn into ever increasing detail. I shall, of course, be happy to answer any more detailed questions that arise from the table that I have supplied. If I do not answer today, I shall do so in correspondence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rather than deal with my question by correspondence, can the Minister shed any light on the new memorandum which he supplied this morning, as it is baffling me totally?<br><br>
On the first page of tables, work No. 2 is listed as costing £7.6 million at November 1988 prices. Price changes are attributed to design changes, but no design changes are referred to in work No. 2—the Penarth head works. The column is blank. However, at 1991 prices, the cost of the Penarth head part of the barrage project has fallen dramatically from £7.6 million to £1 million without any design change. Can we trust the figures if the cost of one part of the project has miraculously dropped to one seventh of its original price without any design change? Can the Minister shed some light on that matter, please?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There has been a fundamental change— no roadway is now being built to Penarth head. I do not think that it is appropriate to describe that as a design change—it is a material feature of which I should have hoped the hon. Member for Cardiff, West would be aware.<br><br>
I shall explain the table and why it is set out as it is. We must first settle which comparisons are being made. During Tuesday's debate, there were references to at least six separate sets of figures, which included the financial memoranda to the private Bill and to the Government Bill; the figures used in the updated economic appraisal of 1990; the published notices of invitation to tender placed in the EC's <i>Official Journal</i> in 1990 and this year; and, finally, the Government forecasts for the outturn cash expenditure.<br><br>
The table does not include figures for the EC <i>Official Journal</i> advertisements because they are not key figures—their sole purpose is to indicate to contractors the size of the contract for which they are invited to register an interest in bidding.<br><br>
I shall say more about the economic appraisal later, but it is not a measure of the changes in cost of the barrage project. The purpose of the appraisal is to measure the relative costs and benefits of the development strategies for Cardiff bay and to indicate the most economically favourable.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0216">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
The important figures for the Committee are the costs in the private Bill and the costs in the financial memorandum to this Bill, together with the Government's forecast for the outturn. I suggest that the Committee will want to see how far the changes are accounted for by inflation, and how far they are accounted for by changes in design. That information is set out in the table that I have circulated. At the bottom of the first column, hon. Members will see that the relevant costs at the time of the private Bill added up to £113 million, as was discussed on Tuesday. The reconciliation between that and the financial memorandum to that Bill was set out in annex B of the letter to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, of which further copies have been tabled today. The other figure of£l 13 million— I recall reference to a coincidence—is that in the financial memorandum to the Government Bill. That represents the costs of the main works only. When land requisition and related expenditure are included, the total is £152.75 million at 1991–92 prices. If comparisons are to be made, those are the relevant figures.<br><br>
We have heard much about spiralling costs. Under the private Bill, parliamentary approval was sought for a scheme that cost £121 million, including the Penarth head works, to which the hon. Member for Cardiff, West referred. Approval is now being sought for a scheme that includes the Penarth head works, but without a roadway, and costs £152.75 million. That is an increase of 26 per cent. The increase in the Property Services Agency construction costs inflation index during that period was 23 per cent. That certainly does not suggest that the project is out of control. Amendments Nos. 71 and 72 would set in the legislation a cash ceiling on the expenditure that could be incurred on the barrage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the coincidence of the figure of £ 113 million in the two memoranda—the original all-up cost and now the works cost without the compensation. I direct him to another strange coincidence. The notes to members of the Committee refer to:
<br><blockquote><p>"Diversion and Modification of Sewers".</p></blockquote>
The cost of that is given as £14.8 million at November 1988 prices. The cost of diversion and modification of sewers three years later, after inflation and/or design changes is, strangely enough, still given as £14.8 million. There is a note next to the second £14.8 million—it is evident that whoever drafted the memorandum is fearful of being accused of putting aside money in a Lichtenstein trust in true Robert Maxwell financial engineering fashion—explaining that some of the sewer diversions have now already been paid for under other headings. In that case, they have already been adduced, as my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has said, as allied works in the original forecast of £402 million total public expenditure, which has since risen to £547 million, and which includes, not just the barrage and the compensation, but all the other works, such as the peripheral distributor road.<br><br>
Does the Minister agree that it does not lend credibility to the figures if, mysteriously, both figures
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
for the diversion and modification of sewers are £14.80 million? Does not it look as though the total was settled first and the component parts made to fit where necessary by removing expenditure from the previously agreed totals and burying it elsewhere so that the Welsh Office could try to maintain—with, I fear, little credibility in the financial world—that the project was still under control? That is financial engineering, not proper accounting</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, sir. No totals were fixed before their components were arrived at. I should be amazed if, in the large number of figures that we have, we did not find some repeated. But that is nothing more than coincidence. We have set the figures out fully and made proper reference to the two figures of £113—I recall the reference to coincidence there— and the hon. Gentleman effectively answered his own intervention by referring to note III in the notes to members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been kind enough to give us these figures. I find them, and the way in which they have been laid out, helpful. An update of the gross barrage-related costs is missing: what is the total now? On 25 November 1991, during the debate on the money resolution, the total was given as 547 million, of which £335 million is public expenditure. Can the Minister provide updated equivalents of those two figures, as he has done for the barrage costs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to expenditures that are not covered by the Bill. We should confine ourselves to the clause in question, but I shall think further about what he has said and see whether I can be more helpful to him and the Committee on that matter.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 71 and 72 would set a cash ceiling on the expenditure. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney acknowledged that that capping would be severe. It would be a major departure from the normal way in which we authorise capital works in legislation. I ask the Committee to reflect on the principle of such a cash limit.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Torfaen, and other Opposition Members who have spoken, alluded to the concept of a blank cheque. That concept is totally foreign to this matter and to all hon. Members. The Cardiff Bay development corporation's expenditure on the barrage will be carefully and separately controlled by the Welsh Office. All the corporation's large projects require approval by the Welsh Office and the Treasury. The grant-in-aid to the corporation is tightly controlled and is reported annually to Parliament, which controls public expenditure and scrutinises the estimates. We all have the opportunity to scrutinise every expenditure including that involved in this project. The concept of a blank cheque is irrelevant.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
I can give the automatic assurance that the Government will want to ensure firm control over the management of the barrage project, but it would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0217">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
be unrealistic to require that any increase in real costs, no matter how small, be authorised by a new Act of Parliament. That is out of line with the normal way in which Parliament controls capital expenditure. The figure referred to in amendments Nos. 71 and 72, for the exercise of that control, is the cost given for the barrage scheme at its design stage in November 1988. Since then, the detailed design process has progressed a long way, as we would expect. Many changes were made after discussions with a range of bodies, some of which, such as the National Rivers Authority, have a statutory role to fulfil. Much more has been done to meet the NRA's requirements for a fish pass. Similarly, the outer harbour and the locks have been designed with navigational and safety considerations in mind as a result of representations made by yachting interests.<br><br>
The amendments, in prescribing the figure of £85 million, do not take account of the fact that the House has already given the Bill a Second Reading on the basis of the updated figures in the financial memorandum. The £113 million construction cost can be reduced, as Opposition Members will, no doubt, be quick to point out, by deducting the cost of the lagoon which is no longer in the Bill. I remind the Committee that we are still pursuing discussions about wildlife mitigation measures and I would not rule out the need to incur expenditure on that when those discussions are completed.<br><br>
The Government believe that the Bill contains adequate safeguards for expenditure on a construction project of this kind and I must resist the amendments. I detected what I took to be a hopeful sign that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney might withdraw the amendment. I hope that he will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That indication was given on the basis that the Government would respond sympathetically to the principle of the amendment. The Bill is unique and needs a unique, statutory requirement of the type suggested in the amendment. If the Minister carries on in that way, he will drive me back to the view that we should force a vote. I had hoped that he would encourage me to do otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall not drive the hon. Gentleman anywhere—I want to tease or pursuade him to come this way. I thought that his acknowledgement that the capping would be severe showed that the amendment was probing and that there would not be any point in pursuing it to a vote.<br><br>
The fundamental argument of the hon. Members for Torfaen, for Cardiff, West and for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and their hon. Friends is that a cost-benefit analysis should be carried out on the barrage as a whole and on each work separately before construction starts. It makes no sense to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the separate elements of the scheme. What would a cost analysis of the breasting dolphins tell us? The scheme needs to be appraised as a whole and in the context of its widest economic costs and benefits.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked about the assumption of private sector involvement. The economic appraisal of the scheme, which has been done three times, regards private sector involvement as fundamental. The purpose and mythology of economic appraisal is to measure the real economic effects and values of the options in the long term. The appraisal has a time horizon of 15 to 20 years, which is deliberately a long enough period to equalise the effects of cycles in the property market.<br><br>
Some hon. Members have questioned the conclusions of the appraisal on the basis that the present state of the property market renders them invalid. Such a view requires profoundly pessimistic assumptions about the UK economy for the next 15 to 20 years, and such assumptions are not remotely tenable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney described in detail the costs and value of office rents. All the Government's calculations were made at the peak of the economic cycle between 1988 and 1990 when the country was in a period of relative boom. If those projections had been made on a median line between 1985 and 1990 or 1980 and 1990 they would have been more valid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I will come to that point. The appraisals have been subjected to a comprehensive range of sensitivity tests including increases in construction costs, delays in development and no development of the more difficult areas of land to be reclaimed, for example in Ferry road, which is north of the peripheral distributor road. The conclusion across the board was that the barrage scheme continued to represent better value for money than any alternative.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Carmarthen spoke at length about the 1980s boom and yuppie jobs. The economic appraisal was not based on the assumption that there would be boom conditions, but on the sound assumption that, in the long term, there would be, on average, significant growth.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Carmarthen questioned the value of the jobs that would be created by the scheme. Forgive me if I do not reply to him—the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central gave him a more than ample response and said what we all know, which is that the beneficial effects of employment generation from the Cardiff bay barrage will not be confined to the capital city of Wales, but will be of great value to all south Wales.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Member for Carmarthen that the matter of the Amman valley has already been brought to my attention. Last week, I visited the Amman and Gwendraeth valleys to meet the local councils and Dyfed county council. We look forward to working together to pursue appropriate developments for that part of his constituency.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Carmarthen also said that the barrage project diverts money from the valleys and west Wales. A great deal of Welsh Office money
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0218">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
has gone, and is going, into the valleys through the programme for the valleys, the rural initiative and through the Welsh Development Agency and the Development Board for Rural Wales. Hon. Members have argued that there is a large number of unemployed people in Cardiff—their own words justify the need for employment and regeneration in Cardiff.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked about the Welsh Health Common Services Authority's decision to locate within the docks. As he is a predecessor of mine in the Welsh Office, I think that he knows that I am precluded from answering by certain commercial confidentialities. If I could give him the details, they would not tell him anything about the effect of the barrage because the rental values in the deal that was struck were set in the absence of the barrage. I give the hon. Gentleman the firmest assurance that officials always seek to strike the very best deals when spending public money, on office space rental or anything else.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney remarked upon there being no public money going into the channel tunnel. I accept that. The Government do not put public money into projects that can be funded commercially. But the regeneration of derelict land in south Cardiff or the valleys usually cannot be achieved without public expenditure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney raised one other question. I promise him that I will reflect further on it and return to it, if I may.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a matter that can be returned to—it has to be dealt with now.<br><br>
One of the most important points that I made was about the ratio of public expenditure to gross barrage-related expenditure. £335 million out of the total cost of £546 million. How has the Minister come to the conclusion that that will be the ratio? Is it based upon firm guarantees from the private sector or upon woolly assumptions of the kind made in the Bennett letter?<br><br>
If those figures were correct in 1990 terms, what are they now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman would imagine, the ratio is based not on firm guarantees from the private sector but on the very best assumptions that can be made in the economic appraisal, which has been very carefully researched. It is the best appraisal possible and, I think, a basis on which we can confidently proceed.<br><br>
I do not believe that the amendments are either realistic or necessary. I invite the Committee to reject them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Winterton, for allowing me to speak a second time on this group of amendments. I realise that I should not really do that, but the grouping of the amendments has altered since I spoke on Tuesday.<br><br>
Amendment No. 86 refers to the need for a cost-benefit analysis, which the Minister has rejected on
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
the ground that the one that we have already is good enough, even though it was produced—as has been mentioned several times—when office-dependent, property-development-sector-led, urban regeneration and docklands redevelopment schemes were very much the vogue. They were seen as an almost dead cert winner for the private sector companies that became involved, as in London docklands, and for any London docklands clones that could be produced elsewhere. In 1988–90, there was almost too much development to handle in London docklands, so it seemed that Liverpool and Cardiff docklands could be redeveloped in the same way.<br><br>
Labour Members' problem is the Minister's stubbornness in refusing to respond to the sea change. That was the expression used by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney who is land-locked, although I admit that the River Taff— the Grand canyon of the industrial revolution, as we sometimes call it in Cardiff—connects his constituency with mine and the sea. The sea change has already caused a huge wave of bankruptcies in London docklands and, therefore, in the entire property development world. It has therefore affected the use of private-public partnership as a method of creating new life in derelict docklands.<br><br>
I want to draw the Committee's attention to the document on this subject, which was, by sheer coincidence, produced this morning. I believe that the Minister will have received a copy through the post. I refer to the Jackie Mallender report, commissioned by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which refers to techniques which the Treasury instructs all Government Departments to apply in carrying out cost-benefit analyses of public sector projects. I hope that the Minister has a copy. If not, I can supply him with one in a few moments. I am assured by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds that a copy was in the post and should have been delivered to the Secretary of State at Gwydyr house this morning. I imagine, therefore, that the officials have had an opportunity to glance over it and to see whether they should be entering into the spirit of things and saying, "Well, okay, this report is wrong. We'll knock holes in it because Jacqueline Mallender has all her facts and figures wrong—since she left the Treasury, cost-benefit analysis appraisal techniques have changed."<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
It is not enough for the Minister to say that the Government's cost-benefit appraisal was intended to be dependent on neither boom nor slump. We are experiencing no ordinary slump. This is no ordinary "blip"—the word Mr. Lawson used when the figures did not fit his Budget forecasts. There has been a change in the relative value of office property compared with residential and industrial property which may remain well beyond 10 years. It is believed that the surplus—or glut—of London office property will not be cleared for 10 to 15 years, even if no new buildings are constructed.<br><br>
London is not Cardiff, but the prospects for an office-led, property redevelopment regeneration of docklands in Cardiff was based on a shortage of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0219">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
London office space at reasonable prices. It was thought that some jobs would move to Cardiff, which would be seen to have some of the advantages of London, only it would be cheaper.<br><br>
If Cardiff is to help fund the barrage scheme, it will not be able to match the cheap price of office space in London's docklands. Prices in London's docklands have dropped to levels which are lower than those in central Cardiff. In 1988–89 when the Government's cost-benefit analysis, on which they still depend, was written, it was never foreseen, even as a theoretical possibility, that—short of a third world war—office rents in Cardiff would be higher than those in substantial areas of commercial London, such as the third big office centre—London's docklands.<br><br>
That is why we are pressing the Government to respond to Jacqueline Mallender's cost-benefit analysis for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which was based on the post-Canary Wharf world. We know from the Marsham street negotiations, which are being conducted by the Property Services Agency on behalf of the Department of the Environment, that offices are available in London docklands at a reasonable price—£ 10 per sq ft—or, if the client wants the marble halls, glass atria and hanging creepers of Canary Wharf, at £15 per sq ft.<br><br>
Until recently, offices in central Cardiff were £16 per sq ft. That is more than Canary Wharf with all its marble halls, and 50 per cent higher than the middle-market London docklands offices. The surplus will not disappear in a year. We are assured that the glut in the City, Westminster and London docklands combined will remain for 10 to 15 years, even if not one single further office block is given planning permission or is constructed.<br><br>
There will be a glut of office space, therefore, for at least the next decade. There may well be an economic upturn during that time, but the glut will remain. The low Cardiff rents and high London rents which were to have provided an incentive for firms comparing the benefits of London with those of Cardiff, will not be recreated. What will firms do if Cardiff is more expensive? How can Cardiff be cheaper if it has to defray the £150 million-plus cost of the barrage and its associated works?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. That is why I tried to prise out of the Minister the rents that were negotiated with the development corporation, which would show what rents are doing. It is an astonishing indictment of the so-called glasnost and the new spirit of the citizens charter, that we are not allowed to know what one public body in Cardiff will charge another in rent. That information would show whether there has been a change in Cardiff rentals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to conclude my remarks, but I want to make a comment on my hon. Friend's intervention.<br><br>
I understand that that building is already half-way up. Is the Minister saying that the rent has not yet
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
been set or that it has been set and he will not tell us what it is? I guess that the rent will be about £12 or £13 a sq ft. I am sure that we could all find out by next Tuesday on the office developers' grapevine. Is the reason for the Minister's reluctance that the Welsh Health Common Services Authority, a Welsh Office subsidiary, has not yet negotiated the rent and is trying to drive it down in line with the current trend to soften office rents?<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister has instructed the Property Services Agency to drive the rent down, because that will affect the viability of the barrage. The offices will have to pay for the barrage. If there are no offices, there will be no barrage and any there are will be highly rated. Of the disbursements that are supposed to come back to the Welsh Office through the Cardiff Bay development corporation, 70 per cent are for sales of land for offices. If the land cannot be sold at much higher prices after the barrage has been built, the commercial basis—the foundation stone—of the barrage is shot to pieces.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will realise that the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney was not a fishing expedition. Rents are a vital factor in the cost-benefit analysis. If the Minister thinks that his cost-benefit analysis is so robust, surely he could say that he has struck the hardest bargain possible, rents in Cardiff bay are still fairly high and there is no need to revise the cost-benefit analysis. However, if office rents are low, it redoubles the case for a new cost-benefit analysis based on the new level of rents post Canary Wharf.<br><br>
I shall conclude my remarks as I do not want to exploit the opportunity that you have given me, Mr. Winterton, to intervene twice in this debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are taking longer to debate clause 1 than we shall take on other clauses because it is so vital. The costing of the barrage is important not only to hon. Members who represent Cardiff constituencies but to all Welsh Members. My hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) expressed his fears.<br><br>
I hope that during the Committee's proceedings the Minister can tell us whether the money allocated by the Treasury to the Welsh Office is exclusively for the Cardiff bay barrage or whether it could be spent on other projects. Several of my hon. Friends will be interested to know the answer to that important question.<br><br>
We do not intend to press amendments Nos. 71 and 72 to a Division because the Minister has said that some of the increase in expenditure is a direct result of representations made to him by the National Rivers Authority and other bodies. We do not wish to oppose such inmprovements to the scheme, but we shall divide the Committee on amendment No. 86 which deals with cost-benefit analysis.<br><br>
We shall divide the Committee for two reasons. First, we are not convinced that the accounting procedures so far used by the Cardiff Bay development corporation and those involved in the costing exercise of the barrage are anything less than sloppy. It is ironic that in the past Conservative
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0220">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
Administrations have placed great weight on good accounting, costing and management, but we are completely unconvinced that that has been done on the Cardiff bay barrage. The Government should accept that there should be much tighter scrutiny of the cost of the project.<br><br>
The second reason for our belief that the cost-benefit analysis of the works should be incorporated in the Bill is that the world has changed dramatically since 1988. The first column in the information kindly given to the Committee by the Minister this morning is headed "Cost at 1988 prices". That year was the very height of the boom in domestic and commercial property prices. The difference between 1988 and today is tremendous. Any body—be it public institution, firm or local authority—should undertak a proper cost-benefit analysis of all its operations to account for the change in economic circumstances. That is especially true of the Cardiff Bay development corporation. The world is altogether different. The Government would be wrong to reject the amendment, as it represents good housekeeping and good accounting practice. It is most important for the general success of the scheme.<br><br>
With that in mind, Mr. Winterton, we intend to press amendment No. 86 to a Division when the opportunity arises. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 71.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall allow the hon. Gentleman to move amendment No. 86 at the appropriate time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 76, in page 1, line 7, at beginning insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (9) below".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we shall take amendment No. 83, in page 2, line 35, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(9) No structure or structures shall be constructed until after the completion of an environmental impact assessment statement as laid down in Annexe 1 of the Environmental Impact Assessments Directive of the European Community.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment, the purpose of which is clear. It is very important that any work undertaken in the construction of a barrage in Cardiff bay should be in line with directives on environmental matters issued by the European Community. It is up to the Minister to give a good reason for not accepting the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall amplify those remarks briefly. Some members of the Committee may not be aware of the difference between annex 1 and annex 2 of the European Community directive that makes certain sorts of environmental impact assessments compulsory for certain projects.<br><br>
Annex 1 applies to projects that are especially environmentally sensitive, and annex 2 applies to projects that are less environmentally sensitive. The problem is that barrages are not mentioned in annex 1, which covers nuclear power stations, steelworks, chemical plants and so on. Barrages and other similar projects are normally covered by annex 2, with which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
the Government have complied already. However, there are big differences between the environmental impact assessments required by annex 1 and annex 2. Those assessments are intended to be appropriate to the degree of the possible negative impact on the environment of any particular project.<br><br>
There is no doubt that the Cardiff bay barrage, because it involves a site of special scientific interest, should have been opted into annex 1. The Government were not obliged to do that, as they had done the minimum necessary for compliance with the European Community's directives on environmental impact assessments. However, the Government should have done more than the minimum, given that they were not dealing with an ordinary barrage on a coastline of no great importance or environmental sensitivity. According to the Government's own nature conservation advice, the Cardiff bay coastline was designated as a site of special scientific interest and is part of the proposed special protection area under the European wild birds directive covering the Severn estuary. The proposal for the SPA has since been sent to Brussels for final designation but with the Cardiff bay SSSI area removed. The fact that it was proposed to take out an SSSI area should have led the Government to say, "Look, if we have a choice between doing the bare minimum and doing the proper job, let's do the proper job." They do not have to, because barrages are not listed under annex 2, which relates to nuclear power stations, steelworks and so on. However, in the case of an SSSI which would have to be flooded and destroyed, the Government should have seen a little red warning light and done the proper job.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
What would it have meant if they had done the proper job? Principally, it would have affected the way in which environmental information is collected and passed to Parliament for our use when judging the project. The annex 2 environment impact assessment, which was available on Second Reading, did not contain the views of the National Rivers Authority, although we have them now. Under annex 2, consultants are hired to consider water quality and the effects on bird life, flora and fauna and so on. The consultants reach conclusions which are returned to them with notes saying, "We don't like this word and that word. This is a bit sensitive. The <i>Western Mail</i> and the <i>South Wales Echo</i> will murder us if we keep the word 'damaging'."<br><br>
The draft is returned to the consultants to be rewritten, perhaps two or three times, until it is acceptable to the customer. That is what goes into the environmental impact assessment carried under annex 2. Under annex 1, consultation is obligatory and the comments of the appropriate regulatory bodies such as the National Rivers Authority and the environmental health department of Cardiff city council must be reprinted, naked and unamended. There is a big difference between the customer, who pays, as promoter of the Bill having a degree of control over what its consultant says and those who are responsible being obliged to submit to the appropriate regulatory authorities and being unable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0221">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
to alter what they say to make it more palatable and less damaging when Parliament considers the measure.<br><br>
The Committee has the NRA's comments, but they are not in the environmental impact assessment. We do not have the comments of the environmental health officer of Cardiff city council, which would have been available had the Government chosen to be brave and act under annex 1. Under annex 1, the regulatory authorities are consulted and make their own comments, which are not filtered through consultants and doctored. The consultants do not get their money until they remove all the nasty words, of which the Under-Secretary and I will make mincemeat when reviewing the case for the barrage. When consultants are used, there is an inevitable cash nexus because they need to get their next job— perhaps from the promoters of the self-same Bill. The Government made a disastrous mistake in allowing the Secretary of State for Wales to take this crucial decision and allow the promoters of the Bill to carry out the bare minimum of environmental impact assessment.<br><br>
The Prime Minister went off to Rio and lectured the Brazilians about what they should do with their rain forests. He would tell them off if they did such an analysis of whether to fell an area of tropical rain forest in the middle of the Amazon jungle. He is, however, happy to allow a non-independent environmental impact assessment in Cardiff docklands. The right hon. Gentleman could so easily have preserved his credentials as someone interested in the environment by saying, "Okay, we don't have to do it under the annex 1 EEC regulations but we will do so because it is an SSSI site used by wading birds that stop off at Cardiff bay in January and February during their migration from Siberia to Africa to pick up four-star fuel from the shrimps." He did not do that, yet he attends the UNCED conference in Rio and lectures the benighted heathen from the third world about his lack of sensitivity to the environment. It is another example of, "Do as I say, not as I do". I hope the Minister will mend his predecessor's ways and those of his Secretary of State and Prime Minister. I hope that he will come clean and commission a proper, independent annex I environmental impact assessment of the project.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond directly to the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Torfaen which contains a complete misunderstanding. I challenge the assumptions of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West. I have a copy of article 4 of the EC environmental assessment directive and it might be helpful if I read it, as it is short:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to article 2 iii, projects of the classes listed in annex I shall be made subject to an assessment in accordance with articles 5 to 10 where member states consider that their characteristics so require".</p></blockquote>
That bears no relation to the hon. Gentleman's claim. At best, he has misunderstood the article. Until he produces evidence to the contrary, the article must stand and we should not accept what the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
When we produced the Bill, we published a full environmental impact statement, which meets EC
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
requirements. The House has every opportunity to assess that statement.<br><br>
I thank the hon. Member for Cardiff, West for giving me a copy of the RSPB report. As of immediately before 10.30 am, the Welsh Office had not received that report. I note that the copy that the hon. Gentleman gave me was faxed. We understood from press reports that the report contained nothing new and nothing that had not been previously considered. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall pass the report to my officials. We shall study it fully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have misunderstood the nature of the document that I gave him. It is not an environmental impact assessment, but a cost benefit analysis. Perhaps he got his words mixed up.<br><br>
When he spoke about an environmental impact assessment, the Minister quoted the phrase:
<br><blockquote><p>"where member states consider that their characteristics so require".</p></blockquote>
I made the point that such an assessment was not obligatory. The Government had the option of carrying out an annex I environmental impact assessment. They chose to carry out an assessment under annex II because a barrage is not listed under annex I. That means that the Government are not obliged to take account of or publish the views of the regulatory agencies. They are simply obliged to publish the views of consultants that they, as promoters of the Bill hired. The difference is crucial to the information that is provided to Members of Parliament. That lack of information had to be remedied by a separate memorandum from the NRA, because the environmental assessment carried out under annex II, which we received on Second Reading, does not include it.<br><br>
Does the Minister claim that I am wrong and that the views of the NRA were published in the environmental impact assessment? I did not see them. I checked to find out why we could not read those views. That is why the memorandum was produced. It is a good memorandum, but we have not received an equivalent document from the environmental health officer of Cardiff city council. Such a document would have had to be included if the Government had opted to carry out an environmental impact assessment under annex I. The barrage will be built on a site of special scientific interest. The Government should, therefore, have played the good boy scout and carried out an environmental impact assessment under annex I, even though they did not have to do so under the directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that there was no confusion about the RSPB report. I wished to take the opportunity to thank him for his kindness in passing a copy to me, and that copy will be studied.<br><br>
I shall not repeat the points that I made in response to the points that he has just repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The points have been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (10) below".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 84, in page 2, line 35, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(10) The Corporation shall not commence the works specified in Schedule 1 to this Act until sewer diversion works ensuring full compliance with the European Community Municipal Wastewater Treatment Directive for Water, entering the impoundment shall have been completed.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment. Does the Minister object to a provision stating that:
<br><blockquote><p>the Corporation shall not commence the works specified in schedule 1 until sewer diversion works ensuring full compliance with the European Community municipal wastewater treatment directive for water entering the impoundment shall have been completed?</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in limboland on the issue. Negotiations are taking place and over the past few days I have tried to find out more about them. How will the definitions apply? Will water from the rivers Taff and Ely that enters the impounded fresh water lake have to meet certain standards of quality? The National Rivers Authority in Wales told me that by the end of July it is expected to provide at least an initial statement to the Welsh Office for the negotiations that are taking place between Welsh Water, the NRA, the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office on whether the waters within and immediately outside Cardiff bay will be rated as sensitive waters. It would make an enormous difference to our consideration of the Bill if that were so because the costings that we discussed under the first group of amendments would be totally different. I should be grateful for any guidance that the Minister can give on that.<br><br>
The NRA told me that, if the waste water directive implementation programme and criteria set in the United Kingdom are finalised in a certain way, the rivers Taff and Ely will have to be phosphate-stripped in my constituency or, perhaps, the Minister's, before the Taff enters impoundment below Blackweir or the Ely enters below the paper mill at Ely weir. The cost of phosphate stripping is not chickenfeed. It will cost £15 million to £20 million unless the chemical industry can come up with a different formula. The river Taff may have to be taken off-line and passed through aluminium and iron tanks as happens to the Rhine in Germany. Phosphate stripping is advanced in Germany because the Germans have no alternative but to use the water from the Rhine as drinking water. We are not proposing to drink the water, but the project could mean considerable additional expenditure of £15 million to £20 million, which has not been included in the costings. We shall not know whether phosphate stripping will be necessary until later this year. Any light that the Minister can shed on the matter will be welcome.<br><br>
The same applies to other waters. The Lavernock sea outfall may require secondary treatment because, for example, it is within five miles of a bathing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
beach or because of other criteria that are set by the environment directorate-general in Europe. Some waters may be subject to secondary or tertiary treatment if they are diverted through the sewer outfalls.<br><br>
I realise that the Minister is in a difficult position while the negotiations are going on, but the questions are critical. They could involve £20 million, £30 million or £40 million of additional cost. We may not know the answer until Christmas or later, but I should be grateful for the Minister's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Cardiff, West has anticipated, my attitude to the amendment is rather negative. I hope that I shall not be unnecessarily negative, and I may have occasion to be more positive at other times during our proceedings.<br><br>
The amendment is inappropriate for several reasons. First, the European Community municipal wastewater treatment directive is not required to be in full operation until the year 2000 for larger outfalls and the year 2005 for smaller outfalls. For waters considered sensitive areas, the directive must be in operation by 31 December 1998. We expect the impounded lake to be classified as a sensitive area.<br><br>
An interdepartmental working group is currently considering the implementation of the directive in the United Kingdom and it is likely to be some months before any final decisions are taken on how the directive's provisions will be applied in the United Kingdom. Therefore, the amendment requires compliance before details of how that is to be achieved are published.<br><br>
Secondly, the broad objectives of the directive will be met by the Government's proposed amendments to the Bill. Proposed Government amendment No. 70 deals with the question of diversions from existing sewers that discharge into the bay. The amendment is unnecessary and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 80, in page 1, line 7, at beginning insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (13) below".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 87, in page 2, line 35, at end add
<br><blockquote><p>"(13) The Development Corporation shall not commence such works until after completion and publication of plans giving the source of the construction materials to be used, the mode of delivery and the consequential environmental impact of the winning and delivery of such materials.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 80 and 87 are important and arise from the colossal quantity of materials that will have to be shifted from one place to another in the construction of the barrage. Dramatic changes have taken place that have made those quantities even greater—there was a 70 per cent increase in the largest single category of materials— yet there has been a lack of assessment so far of the effects on the environment of moving that amount of sand, gravel and concrete.<br><br>
I have been probing the issue because of the details in the two pre-qualification advertisements in the supplements of the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities on 14 November 1990 and on 5 June 1992. They show dramatic changes arising from the alteration in the design of the barrage. I am relying on memory for the figures which, therefore, may be subject to correction by the Minister, but the amount of dredged material—a mixture of sand and mud— from the Bristol channel has increased by 70 per cent from 1,000,000 cu m to 1,700,000 cu m. The amount of sand has increased from 1,300,000 cu m—virtually a tonne—to 1,500,000 cu m, which is an increase of 200,000 cu m. Similarly, the amount of structural concrete—by and large reinforced concrete—has increased from 125,000 cu m to 140,000 cu m and the amount of sheet steel piling has increased from 17,000 tonnes to 20,000 tonnes.<br><br>
Those are the very large quantities that most of us who lived in south Wales when the Llanwern steelworks was being built in the late 1950s will recall having been carried, in a virtually non-stop line of lorries, from areas such as Maestag through to east of Newport. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), who later worked in that steelworks, will remember well the transportation of red shale from the Llynfi valley to Newport to raise the levels at Caldicot by 50 ft. However, when that was happening in 1957, people were not as environmentally conscious as they are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
now. There is no way that such a continuous line of lorries would be tolerated without protest today, even for a good cause, which the construction of the Llanwern steelworks undoubtedly was. As the barrage is more controversial, I doubt whether it would be viewed in that light, even if we were no more environmentally sensitive than we were in 1957.<br><br>
However, I am sure that we all agree that we live in an age of protest. People are highly environmentally sensitive about extensions of quarries, increases in the amount of stone and of blasting in quarries and increases in dredging from the channel, which creates sand banks a mile off shore and results in reduced beach cover. People immediately protest at such activity. That is why we tabled the two amendments which would prompt the Government into specifying how, over the four-to-five-year period of the construction of the barrage, they would route the huge quantities of materials that were needed. Some would come from the west of England, some from the middle of the channel and some from south Wales. The Government would have to specify also the anticipated numbers of lorry journeys per day on certain roads for the transportation of crude materials over the first two years. Once the finishing materials were involved, the quantities and numbers of journeys would decrease.<br><br>
That seems a reasonable request, given the vast quantities of materials that are involved. In the light of some of the comments in the press yesterday, I say to the Under-Secretary, the hon. Member for Cardiff, North in the best possible fraternal spirit, that 1,700,000 cu m of dredged material, 1,500,000 cu m of sand, and 140,000 cu m of concrete amount to masonary on a colossal scale and this time it is not free. It will all be paid for by the taxpayer and so it seems right and proper for the Government to give advanced estimates of how the project will be run during its construction phase and how, in terms of environmental loss, the areas that provide the construction material can be saved from the worst depredations of dust, lorry noise and road accidents.<br><br>
There are three reasons for emphasising that point. First, the current construction of the Butetown link road is causing the mother and father of rows in the Butetown community, which is represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael), who is not in the Room at present. The link road is causing enormous sensitivity, but that will be totally dwarfed by the size of the Cardiff bay barrage project. People will not stand for living through four and a half years of such disruption. They will refuse to let their roads be used to bring in materials to the construction sites at either end of the barrage.<br><br>
Secondly, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr Howells) has approached me and my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney as we are members of the Committee and he is not. I shall not dwell on the machinations that prevented Welsh Members being able to represent their constituents on the Committee, as they should be able to do. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd tells me that in Creigiau in his constituency, which borders mine and that of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0224">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Sweeney), there is already a big row about the possibility of doubling the size of quarries on the south-facing outcrop of the south Wales mountain plateau, which is rich in limestone. The limestone will be used to make the 140,000 tonnes of structural concrete referred to in the pre-advertisement tender notice in the supplement to the <i>Official Journal.</i><br><br>
Perhaps the third reason is the most important of all—the effect on the Bristol channel of the dredged material and the sand fill. For this contract alone, the volume of sand and other dredged material may be as much as 10 per cent of all the material that has ever been dredged on the upper Bristol channel over the past 50 or 60 years since records have been kept.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister can verify that the Welsh Office is sufficiently concerned about the implications for beach erosion of removing dredged material for building purposes from sand banks close inshore and its impact on popular tourist beaches further west in Porthcawl and the Gower peninsula that it has refused permission for a recent dredging licence. The Welsh Office wants to carry out a study. That has annoyed the Building Employers Confederation but, quite rightly, the Welsh Office insist that the study should be done. There used to be a 5 ft thickness of sand on one of the beaches on the Gower peninsula but half the sand seems to have disappeared, which is a major loss. It is not caused by taking the sand off the beach, but when sand is taken from the channel, the sea readjusts the level and the tide pulls the sand off the beaches to drop into the big holes that the dredgers' buckets have ripped out to feed the building industry.<br><br>
Furthermore, the Cardiff Bay development corporation probably shares our concern as it has applied for a prospecting licence for deep dredging in the middle of the Bristol channel rather than keeping as near the shore as possible, which would be much cheaper. The nearer the shore the dredging is done, the greater the likelihood that the tide will fill the holes off nearby beaches.<br><br>
The deeps in the Bristol channel are very deep— perhaps 130 ft deep between Flatholm and Steepholm at high spring tide—so it will be far more expensive to get the material from there rather than from the inner banks. That may affect the cost of the barrage. The Welsh Office now implies—and perhaps the Cardiff Bay development corporation agrees—that it is better to spend a bit more money to ensure that the barrage does not have the indirect consequence of damaging the tourist trade in Lavernock, Sully, Swanbridge, Barry and perhaps above all in Porthcawl because undreamed-of quantities of material have been dredged for construction. Those quantities would amount to a significant part of what historically has been dredged from the Bristol channel for building materials.<br><br>
It is clear that the Welsh Office shares our concern. For example, recently it has called in the Helwick bank dredging application. That is not directly relevant to our discussion today, as it is located 50 miles west of the barrier site, but the Welsh Office has also investigated the impact of dredging off Porthcawl on the beaches there. All hon. Members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
agree that there would be no point in building a barrage, even though it would provide construction jobs and perhaps the suggested 25,000 jobs that might be created if there were another office boom in this country, if tourist industry jobs in Barry island, Porthcawl and the Gower were lost through beach erosion on a significant scale.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
My plea this morning is that the Minister should shed what light he can on the Welsh Office's willingness to protect the communities that are likely to be affected. The single, theoretical justification for the presence of some English Members of Parliament in this Committee is that they represent constituencies in the west of England whose quarries might be expanded if the necessary material cannot be obtained from the Bristol channel. That point has been made by Brian Madge, a distinguished expert on material taken from that channel. His recent consultancy study, commissioned by members of the Association of District Councils along the south Wales foreshore, was reported extensively in the <i>Western Mail</i> on Monday. He and the Building Employers Confederation stated that, if the sand cannot be taken from the Bristol channel, the nearest alternative source is in Worcestershire, Wiltshire or the Mendips.<br><br>
It is pretty theoretical, but that might be a good reason for having English Members of Parliament in the Committee. They may want to vote against the Government on one or two clauses—especially this clause—because of the effect of the expansion of sand pits and quarries in their areas. That expansion would result from the fact that it is no longer possible to get the necessary material from the Bristol Channel for what would be much the biggest construction project in south Wales since the Llanwern steelworks was built. The sight of the never-ending streams and merry-go-rounds of lorries converging from all parts to east of Newport was a unique experience for anyone who spent their youth in south Wales.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister is able to give confidence to me, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr Howells), and even to some of his hon. Friends who represent constituencies with quarrying and building industry interests in the rich west of England.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West has spelt out, in his usual effective way, the practical consequences of construction work on the scale of the barrage and, I am sure, has struck a chord with all members of this Committee.<br><br>
There has been an astonishing change for the better in our communities. There is a new spirit behind the defence of our communities' environment. I wonder sometimes how, in the 1990s, we could sink a new pit in any of the valley communities, given that the attendant noise and dust would be at odds with the new feeling for the environment.<br><br>
The growth of residents' and protest groups and of the expression of community sentiment through action committees has become a familiar feature of our lives. In my 25 years as a Member of Parliament, I have watched the way in which the community's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0225">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
sense of resignation and willingness to go along with what was done—either because people felt that it was good in a general way or because they felt helpless to prevent it—has been transformed into an almost instant reaction to any development that might happen in the immediate vicinity of a community. Action groups are set up and petitions drafted within minutes. Word processors mean that much sophisticated effort is used to ensure that the message travels from the streets to the village, from the village to the borough and thence to international organisations that descend upon the community to support the latest protest on behalf of the environment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West did not exaggerate the nature of community activity. He merely emphasised it. His description of the sheer size of such movement of materials should jolt us into wondering how the measure can physically be enacted in a way that will not lead to the enormous protests that reach beyond Cardiff.<br><br>
It is sad that none of our earlier suggestions were accepted. Even the suggestion that other Welsh Members of Parliament could attend our proceedings and speak, if not vote, was rejected. No one can imitate the style of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd. He would vividly describe people's feelings in his constituency. They have only just found out—I hope that I am not putting words into my hon. Friend's mouth—from the small print of a Welsh Development Agency document, that a quarry will be extended in the constituency of Pontypridd to service the Cardiff bay barrage. I hope that I reflect the feelings of my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd. On the basis of his parliamentary interventions, I believe that he and his community determinedly oppose the barrage. The notion that a section of his community will be disrupted so radically to build the barrage adds injury to insult. My hon. Friend is only one Member who could face an outcry as a result of the measure.<br><br>
I had not thought about the impact on the sandy beaches of heavy, deep dredging through the centre of the Bristol channel, how nature would reclaim and fill the hole, probably from the beaches. My wife comes from Kidwelly. During our married lifetime, we have watched the sand in an estuary there, shift and change. That happens through natural processes and without any heavy intervention such as large-scale dredging. On land or sea, the promoters and developers of the scheme will encounter problems, but that does not give us comfort.<br><br>
Parts of my community may have to undergo large physical construction. The Secretary of State frequently refers to the largest European land reclamation scheme, which is occurring in my constituency at almost nil cost to the Government; we are expected to undertake our reclamation schemes without major cost to the Welsh Office. The large scheme in my constituency has taken place in three phases. It has been sensitively handled by liaison committees representing the contractors, the local authority, the Welsh Development Agency and British Coal. British Coal wanted to ravage and dig
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
up both sides of the valley and carry out opencast mining pending some future directive. Any hon. Member who represents a constituency like mine will know what the community's reaction is likely to be.<br><br>
We all want to belong to a greener and better community. That wish is not confined to those in the leafy suburbs of Worcestershire or even of Cyncoed, Cardiff, North and Cardiff, Central. That sentiment is shared by valley communities which were willing to put up with enormous hassle. Any hon. Member whose constituency contains a pit—mine had four until the Government came to power—will know what a nuisance they are and what difficulties arise, but communities are willing to put up with that because pits mean jobs. People will not be willing to put up with lorries carrying large amounts of waste material, of whatever kind, trundling through their communities, to the site of a scheme that they oppose.<br><br>
The amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West lay down a plan so that we will know the environmental consequences before the protest action by residents barricading the way into and out of the site begins. We must know now what is planned. If we do not, we shall find out later, to our cost.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will react in a positive fashion to this sensible, imaginative amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I admire the ingenuity of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West in reversing his arguments about the membership of the Committee. I trust that my hon. Friends will not be tempted by his seductive words to take the course that he advocates.<br><br>
I understand that the purpose of the amendments is to ensure that the environmental impact of the winning of materials and their delivery to the work site has been considered. I agree with those who tabled the amendments that those matters are important and I take note of the point made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West about the attitude of the Welsh Office to such conservation features. However, the issues raised by the amendments have been considered and taken into account in work already carried out; they need not, therefore, be included in the Bill.<br><br>
The winning of materials must be in accordance with planning applications and licences issued by the appropriate planning authority and landowners to the contractors who supply those materials. It is for those local authorities to take into account the impact of the operation for which they have given approval and for them to enforce whatever conditions they may have stipulated in the approvals.<br><br>
The Committee can rely on the local authorities— as the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney reminded us—to be conscious of the views of local people at the site of material supplies. The same applies should the corporation seek a sand abstraction licence in the estuary.<br><br>
On the matter of delivery of materials to the site, the effect was considered in the environmental impact statement, which sets out the proposal for the delivery of materials. I refer hon. Members to part 13(2)(1) entitled, "Construction Traffic".</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister says. I was aware of the section in the environmental impact assessment study that covers construction materials. The problem is that the barrage is now more physically bulky. In terms of dredge material, it has expanded by 70 per cent since its initial design. The environmental impact assessment study was done before the change in design. We are talking now about a wider, fatter, bigger barrage requiring much more dredge material—70 per cent if my mathematics is correct—and sand from the channel. The environmental impact assessment study may well not fit the bill since the dramatic change in the shape of the barrage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point remains the same. The amendment would not mean greater control over dredging. The Welsh Office would want to keep the dredging issue under review, but the Bill does not authorise any dredging.<br><br>
The purpose to be served by the plan proposed in the amendment is unclear. Who, if anyone, will approve it? Who will be consulted? What would be the effect on the contract if the delivery routes to be set out in the contract documents in accordance with the environmental statement were to be altered as a result of publication of the plan?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In recent months I have seen the effects of construction work in part of my constituency so I am aware of the impact of large engineering works. Those responsible do not realise the impact that they will have on local communities, even with the best will in the world.<br><br>
I regret that I have missed part of the debate because I am involved in the Standing Committee considering the Community Care (Residential Accommodation) Bill. The Minister seems to accept the general import of the amendment—that there is a need for plans to be defined, published and prepared. Perhaps the Minister can clarify some points and redraft an amendment to be tabled at a later stage. The matter need not divide the Committee.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the amendment need not divide us. I find myself agreeing very much with the principles involved, but the amendment is unnecessary. The Committee stage of the Bill is a developing process. We shall continue to think about various matters and if amendments are to be tabled, we may go down certain roads. I accept the points that have been made. Much depends on how local planning authorities view matters. We are all increasingly concerned about environmental impact in local planning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is well aware of the construction work in my constituency at the Malpas bypass and Brynglas tunnels. I received a letter from the Minister of State this morning informing me that there was a restriction on pile driving in my constituency before 8 am, but there is no restriction on other works before that time. Work is taking place at 6 am and 7 am
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
within yards of people's homes. We must consider how permissive we have been on construction work. People's lives are considerably disrupted by it. The Committee should make some recommendation before this enormous enterprise takes place in Cardiff.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jones</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Inevitably, I cannot comment on the specific point raised by the hon. Gentleman, but I am sure that all local planning authorities are increasingly concerned about the issue. They should take these matters into consideration.<br><br>
I do not dispute the purpose of the amendment. It seeks to ensure that the environmental impact of extracting and delivering materials has been considered, but that is covered by local authorities' licensing arrangements with the material suppliers and by the environmental statement to the Bill. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the amendment is unnecessary, but that is not what he said a couple of minutes ago in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth. I thought that he hinted that he was sympathetic to the idea behind the amendment although he thought that the drafting was ambitious, overly-restrictive or dismissive of existing environmental protection in planning permissions.<br><br>
The problem is that with competitive tendering, the contractor with the lowest price wins the contract and then uses cowboy methods—a phrase that causes no end of pain to my uncles in Colorado, who always insist that cowboys are honest. I am sure that the Minister knows what I mean by cowboy methods. The contractors rip the stuff out of the ground in the cheapest possible way and take it away in the cheapest, oldest lorries at 4 am if it is daylight. We have all had that problem in our constituencies but it cannot be controlled. Once the contractor has won the contract, he can say "I won the contract on the basis that I knew that I could start my lorries at daybreak on 21 June next door to somebody's house. That is his hard luck. I won the contract on the cheapest price. It is up to me where I get the materials from".<br><br>
On a project of a scale unprecendented since Llanwern and possibly including the old Richard Thomas and Baldwin Llanwern works, we need new rules that require the pre-publication of the primary routes by which the construction materials will be delivered and the quarries, sandbanks, or parts of the Bristol channel from which they will be taken, so that everyone will be aware, in advance, of the environmental cost of constructing the barrage.<br><br>
In the light of the second, much more restrictive, attitude that the Under-Secretary has taken, I am not willing to withdraw the amendment and I shall press it to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We now come to amendment No. 82, but before I call the hon. Member for Torfaen to move it, I should tell the Committee that after consultation with the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and the Committee Clerk I have selected amendment No. 108, although we may not reach it in this sitting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 108 names a mythical river—the river Twey. That is the result of my illegible handwriting. Most of us could have dwelt on mythical river Twey for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Murphy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 82, in page 1, line 14, leave out "associated" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"consequential environmental and coastal protection".</p></blockquote>
I shall be brief, as I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney is anxious to speak to his amendment No. 108.<br><br>
Clause 1(9)(b) states that the Cardiff Bay development corporation will be responsible for "certain associated structures" as well as for the barrage itself. We believe that it would be helpful to add the words
<br><blockquote><p>"consequential environmental and coastal protection".</p></blockquote>
as a statement of the Government's intent to take seriously their responsibility to protect the coast and the environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Morgan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to amplify, briefly, the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen in moving the amendment. As with the first group of amendments, our intention is to pin down the Government so that vague words such as "associated" are omitted from the Bill. Such words can mean anything and nothing. We want to clarify exactly what the Government want Parliament to authorise in this clause on page 1.<br><br>
We are not happy about the word "associated". Its use is unclear, as, when the looseness of the degree of association cannot be defined, it could allow individual items of work to be included or left out as the Government choose. We want to improve the definition. If there are additional works on the barrage, the breasting dolphins, or the outer harbour as a result of mitigation works, the word "consequential" which appears in the amendment would be appropriate. Similarly, the phrase "environmental protection" would cover the mitigation works, at which the Minister has hinted
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
but for which he has not supplied an estimate of cost. Finally, the phrase "coastal protection"—which affects the area of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth—is not likely to arouse objection.<br><br>
The preamble to the Bill uses the word "related", while the text uses the word "associated". What is the difference? Why are both words used? We must be clear about what we are being asked to authorise. If something is part of the barrage, or dependent on it, or if the barrage cannot be built without it, we must use the word "consequential" if the work is part of the environmental or mitigation works. We would not object to that. However, the use of "associated" and "related" is simply sloppy drafting. The line-by-line scrutiny by this Committee cannot allow that to pass.<br><br>
We want to pin down what the Government mean by "associated" and "related", which they use in the Bill's preamble and opening clause, because we are worried that they want to leave the relationship loose. That would allow the Government to alter, include and omit items as they need to in order to make the component parts fit the total that they have determined already.<br><br>
We have heard today about the increasing costs of the barrage. That increase stems in part from the looseness of definition as to which of the six works is under discussion at any given time. Opposition Members have been instrumental in increasing the costs related to the barrage in connection with groundwater and water clean-up, but that plainly is covered by the amendment. We object to the Government's freedom of manoeuvre to include or omit items to reach totals that they think will be acceptable to public or Treasury eyes.<br><br>
We have made part of this case already, but I have finally managed to track down the financial memorandum to the 1987 version of this Bill. That put the barrage's cost at only £61 million. Yet the memorandum provided by the Minister this morning puts the cost of the barrage and associated works— including the groundwater works—at £167.7 million. The Government have refused to answer parliamentary questions on that matter, and obtaining the figure has been like extracting teeth. But that figure is the outturn total—the amount that the project will actually cost if it were started next year and finished by 1988.<br><br>
Such sums require rigorous definition, at this stage of line-by-line scrutiny. Even the total of £167.7 million may be a serious underestimate. The Mallender report puts the cost at 1991 prices at £162 million. Adding on four years of inflation would put the total more realistically at about £180 million or £190 million.—<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney suggests that we round the figure up to £200 million. That reminds me of the earlier suggestion from the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Mr. Sweeney) to the effect that the toll on the Severn bridge would be better set at £3 than £2.80. Perhaps the hon. Member for the Vale of Glamorgan will agree with my hon. Friend's rounding up of the barrage's cost.</span></p>
