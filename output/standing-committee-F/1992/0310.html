DUTIES AND POWERS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [3 March]</i> No. 1, in page 1, line 18, leave out "press freedom" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and to promote the fundamental freedom of the press to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas."—<i>[Mr. Soley.]</i> </p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking amendment No. 6 in title, line 1, leave out "and impartiality".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Secretary of State for National Heritage (Mr. Peter Brooke)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a great pleasure to resume the debate after the help that I received at the close of the previous sitting.<br><br>
The Government would naturally acknowledge that freedom of expression is fundamental in a democratic society. We would also accept the underlying arguments advanced by the privacy committee and in Sir David Calcutt's review of self-regulation—that press regulatory bodies should not be concerned with the protection of press freedom, but should attend rather to complaints against the press. Still less do we think that such bodies should concern themselves with the promotion of press freedom. If clause 2 is to stand part of the Bill, I ask the Committee not to accept the amendment.<br><br>
It is a familiar experience in this House that the Liberal party runs with the hare and apologises to the hounds when they catch up. I would not commit the discourtesy of likening the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley) to a Liberal, but there is an element of the practice that I have described in his formulation of the Bill. Incidentally, as a sixth generation Member of Parliament, with four generations of Liberal Members in my past—there were only Tories in the past two generations—I am distressed that the Committee has not so far enjoyed the company of the hon. Member for Gordon (Mr. Bruce). The Liberal party has always attached importance to the subject that we are discussing. You, Mr. Hogg, may well have received an apology from him explaining why he is not in our midst. Of course we must all hope that he will join us later.<br><br>
It may be sensible in talking of press freedom to remind the Committee of an observation made by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
another Liberal statesman, Lloyd George: that no speech made in the House of Commons should contain more than one point—or that a speech made by a very distinguished Member could contain a point and a half. The hon. Member for Hammersmith has endeavoured in his Bill to include two points. That is what we wish to resist.<br><br>
The Government would be happy to support amendment No. 6, as we do not think that newspapers should be required to present news impartially. They are, and always have been, partisan, and the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) said very much the same thing last week.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett) said, in an exchange with me last week about spectrum scarcity, that it had nothing to do with the exercise of impartiality by the electronic media. We did not pursue the matter then, but I think that he would acknowledge on reflection that it is that very scarcity that places a duty of impartiality on the electronic media, whereas our pluralist press arrangements will enable any error or undue partiality to be corrected in other parts of the market place. As the hon. Group said himself—though he will forgive me if I have forgotten—there is no reference in the body of the Bill to impartiality and its inclusion in the long title is therefore otiose.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief, because we have covered these arguments.<br><br>
I reiterate that I originally lifted the term "impartiality" in the long title from the Broadcasting Act 1990, not least because if the Government were able to support it then, they should be able to support it in this Bill. Having heard the problems caused to broadcasting journalists, I think that it would be a mistake to extend it to the press. Logically, the Government should reverse the idea in broadcasting; it was resisted until added as an amendment in the House of Lords while the Broadcasting Bill was going through the House of Commons.<br><br>
I understand the Secretary of State's argument that it would be undesirable to have a body that dealt with both regulation and freedom, but there is no defence of press freedom at law in this country. If rumours are correct, the danger is that there may be another Act of Parliament dealing with restrictions on bugging, photography or privacy, but there would be no counter-balancing press freedom. Britain has a privacy law without a counter-balancing press freedom or freedom of information Act. To the best of my knowledge, we are the only country in the western democratic world without such a balance.<br><br>
I understand that argument about Britain having a written constitution and it therefore being difficult to put the proposals into our legal procedures, which is what I would have liked to have done. If they cannot be included, the case for a body that promotes press freedom is overwhelming, primarily because press freedom has been eroded dramatically over the past 10 to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0316">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
20 years. That is generally conceded and it is one of the few things in the Bill that the press agrees with. The erosion of press freedom is not healthy. A body that operates as a whistle blower is called for to emphasise the need for press freedom.<br><br>
I set up a committee to take evidence, not least from Baroness Hollis, and it was put to me that a body was needed to balance the requirement to regulate and the limitations on press excesses against the right and duty of the press to investigate effectively. The Baroness and others who served on the old Press Council felt that such a balancing act was constitutionally vital if press freedom could not be balanced by a privacy law, allowing counter-balancing in court. This argument will return to bedevil the Government because they will try to write opt-out clauses into any legislation on the press that they pass. The clauses may contain ideas suggested by Sir David Calcutt. The Government may decide to have a press ombudsman with the ability to levy fines. They will have to write in exclusion clauses, perhaps stating, "It is permissible to invade privacy if it is to expose a public wrong-doing".<br><br>
The problem with that is twofold. First, the Government would not be prevented from taking action. A powerful criticism of not having a written constitution is that a Government can do anything that they want. Secondly, and more important to the Bill, there would be no defence of press freedom, and the good investigative journalist—whom we are anxious to protect—would have to look over his shoulder constantly, not just at the libel laws but at the possibility of breaching the code.<br><br>
If there is to be an ombudsman—which the Government may favour—or a privacy Bill, or anti-bugging or anti-photograph legislation, restricting such activities on private property, opt-out clauses will have to be included. Journalists would fight them in court, but before reaching court, good investigative journalists would be in danger of having their stories spiked because their editor was not willing to take risks. That is the danger for a free press. There is sometimes a feeling that anything goes, which is a criticism of the press, but there cannot be good investigative journalism because the press have been tied down by more and more laws over the past several decades. The amendment would deal with that.<br><br>
I do not want to delay the Committee further on this matter. We have had a substantial debate on it. I recommend that the Committee accept the amendment, not because it is perfect but because it beefs up the Bill. Had I had the power to include a legal defence of press freedom, I would have done so. Of course, it was not possible for me to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not seek to prolong the debate, but the issue is important. My quarrel with the hon. Member for Hammersmith is about including press freedom and regulation in the same Bill. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that this was an issue of controversy for the Press Complaints Commission and that there was a degree of ambiguity in the commission's attitude to it.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
It was suggested that Sir David Calcutt's criticism of the Press Complaints Commission for having that as an objective was not sustained by the commission itself. Yet the hon. Gentleman claims that the press are anxious to have press freedom and regulation covered in the same Bill. There is a degree of contrariness in that. I am resisting the hon. Gentleman's amendment not on the basis of the issue, but on that of including it in the same Bill. In algebraic terms, if X and Y have the same value, it is a difficult exercise to balance them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Erdington cited the Independent Television Commission as an example of such a body in the electronic media. One might ask why, if we can have a commission for that media, we cannot have an independent press authority. It is worth remembering that the ITC does not have the obligation to promote what I would call electronic freedom. It has a responsibility to secure competition and diversity of services only. That is a relevant rebuttal of the point made by the hon. Member for Hammersmith.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested by the Secretary of State's remarks, but I do not think that they rebut the arguments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith.<br><br>
It is true that the ITC and its predecessor, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, had no parallel responsibility in respect of freedom in the electronic media. As the Secretary of State acknowledged, broadcasters are much more highly regulated than the printed media, and for very good reason. But the principle reason was not spectrum scarcity; there were other reasons for regulation.<br><br>
We have already referred to the obligations of fairness and balance on broadcasters in commercial television and radio or the BBC. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith pointed out that the notion of impartiality was important in the debates in another place on the Broadcasting Act. The regulations for the electronic media do not constitute an argument against our proposals for the printed media.<br><br>
The predecessor body of the Press Complains Commission, the Press Council, collapsed for many reasons—and collapse it did. The Press Council had an obligation to keep an eye on and report on issues of freedom of the press. Owners, editors and journalists saw some sense in that. The final sections of the annual reports of the Press Council took readers on a tour of press freedom issues in this country and around the world. One of the hallmarks of a democratic society—and some countries have changed their beastly habits—is the freedom of the press to express views and opinions that the authorities find uncomfortable and abhorrent. When Hugh Cudlipp—now Lord Cudlipp—was editor of the <i>Daily Mirror,</i> it was his maxim that the role of the press was to afflict the comfortable and to comfort the afflicted. That description gets a difficult relationship about right.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The Press Council has taken some active interest in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0317">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
press freedom. My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith said that one of the curiosities of Britain is that press freedom is not enshrined in law. I understand why the Press Complaints Commission chose to concentrate narrowly on complaints, although it was wrong to do that. My hon. Friend wishes to include press freedom in the remit of the body that the Bill would establish. A body that is interested in the press should also be interested in press freedom. The focus of the Press Complaints Commission was too narrow—that was one of its faulty pillars. It existed solely as a complaints body. Dealing with complaints is important, there is more to the activities of the press than that.<br><br>
In some ways, the proposal fits in with the Government's philosophy, as reflected in the citizens charter. I do not jest. The body that the Bill proposes would be responsible for keeping an eye on press freedom, and would speak on behalf of the reader and the citizen. It would alert citizens to what goes on in this country and elsewhere to the detriment of a proper freedom of the press. That is important in a democracy. I understand the Secretary of State's view, but it is wrong for the new body to have such a narrow focus—a drainpipe focus—when other activities deserve its attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without a general legal defence of press freedom, we are in danger of eroding press freedom. That has been well argued. We also recognise the problem of irresponsible press behaviour. Without a general legal defence of press freedom, the new regulatory body will have to carry out the difficult but important task of balancing freedom and responsibility.<br><br>
Some of the invasions of privacy or abuses about which we complain are relevant to press freedom. I have said that the majority of complaints will continue to be sorted out between the editor and the complainant, or, if the complaints go further, by the new body. A small number of complaints will not be sorted out because they involve the two conflicting issues: freedom and responsibility of the press. It has been suggested that it would be sensible for the new IPA to have two sub-committees, one dealing with complaints and one with freedom. If a complaint brought them into conflict, the two committees would sit as one.<br><br>
There are problems with the way the Press Complaints Commission is set up, and with its membership. The proposed authority would hold both issues in balance is because it would consist predominantly of lay members. I have also argued that although the body's membership should contain journalists of distinction who are committed to the concept of press freedom, editors should play a minor role. I am arguing not that editors should be omitted from the authority, but that they should not predominate. Their interests do not necessarily have as much to do with press freedom and responsibility as with circulation. The hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) made the point very powerfully, when cross-examining witnesses in my committee, that editors are interested in selling newspapers. A large number of editors on the body could
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
lead to the commercial drive to increase circulation overriding press freedom and responsibility issues. An authority whose membership was similar to those of the broadcasting bodies would balance both interests.<br><br>
I make no secret of the fact that if I were presented with the alternative of a general defence of press freedom, I would be much much happier about going down the general regulatory road, whether that would entail using the ombudsman procedure, my proposed procedure or any other structure. The amendment and this part of the Bill aim to tackle the problem caused by this lack of a general legal defence of press freedom.<br><br>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder, Mr. Hogg, whether you felt that you might be like the chairman of the proposed independent press authority when you had to cast your vote on this difficult issue?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps that illustrates the sort of difficult decisions that will have to be taken if the proposed body is set up.<br><br>
I still feel unhappy that the hon. Member for Hammersmith believes that the independent press authority
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0318">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
will put everything right. I am also unhappy about the red herring argument that the Bill is necessary for the freedom of the press—on which we can then impose restrictions. Surely the best way of ensuring press freedom would be to impose no restrictions at all on the press.<br><br>
Earlier this morning, the Secretary of State said that errors would be corrected in the market place. Yet the hon. Member for Hammersmith said a moment ago that the dominance of the editors is wrong and that their concern was with circulation. However, newspapers that had no circulation would not exist. The hon. Gentleman has not acknowledged that many people do not even read a newspaper. We want a press that reaches as many people as possible. That means that editors should be primarily concerned with circulation, not with fitting in with the strictures of an independent press authority.<br><br>
The Bill is restrictive, although the hon. Gentleman has dressed it up as a measure that will improve press freedom. The Bill will not cause more newspapers to be sold to more people, even though many people are insufficiently informed about what is going on because they do not read newspapers. I do not agree that accuracy will result only through imposition by the proposed statutory body. Accuracy is the responsibility of editors, and I do not share the hon. Gentleman's reluctance to let them assume it. In the end, it is the purchasers of a newspaper who decide whether it will continue to exist and whether they support the judgment of the editors. The market place will sort out such matters better than the imposition of the authority.<br><br>
I have received a number of representations about the Bill, and it may help the Committee if I refer to some of them in connection with the amendments. They reflect the opinions of people who produce newspapers and their belief that there are difficulties with the Bill.<br><br>
With reference to amendment No. 8, all hon. Members will agree that as much accuracy as possible is desirable, but it is not clear that the independent press authority would be able to determine what is fact and what is not. The authority's work could result in arguments being prolonged and prominence being given to continued debate about the accuracy of earlier statements. The press could be full of refutations of claims and counter-claims. There would be less room for news, which is what people buy newspapers for.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will have been sent a copy of the code of practice of the Press Complaints Commission. I am critical of that document, but its first clause covers accuracy and lays an obligation on newspapers and periodicals not to publish
<br><blockquote><p>"inaccurate, misleading or distorted material."</p></blockquote>
There is very little difference between that and what my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith is saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no argument with that. I should like the Press Complaints Commission to work
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
more effectively, but that is more likely to happen through peer group pressure from its members than by external imposition, which will cause fierce arguments about what is accurate and what is not.<br><br>
There is no perfect and simple answer to the problem. I do not argue with the Press Complaints Commission's proposals. They will either work or they will not. The representations that I have received say that the Bill would give powers to the proposed independent press authority that go far beyond the objective of enforcing accuracy. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I have had a number of such representations. It is rather strange, given that the Bill does not enjoy the Government's total support and is opposed in various other quarters, that I, an independent Back Bencher—if the Secretary of State will forgive me for not being entirely in the same boat as he—should be the sole voice for some of those representations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who are they?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have had representations from the <i>Bolton Evening News,</i> the "Bolton Metro News", the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> and others. If the hon. Gentleman wants to consult my files later, I should be glad to show him them. If he can read, he will have read what has been published. I am not sure whether he was a member of the committee set up by the hon. Member for Hammersmith, but I refer him to some items in the large document here, which make it clear that many people have reservations. If he has difficulty in understanding those points, I can take him through them. No doubt he would like to visit Bolton and discuss the issues with the editor of the <i>Bolton Evening News.</i><br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Such matters were given great prominence. The "Bolton Metro News" devoted a whole page to the worries that some people have, and there were some editorials and the best part of a page, if not a full page, in the <i>Bolton Evening News.</i> The managing director of the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> wrote to me expressing the hope that those reservations would be raised during discussions of the Bill in Parliament.<br><br>
It has been put to me that the Bill would not work. It would mean another interfering body, which sounds good, as people are happy to agree with any suggestions regarding the freedom and responsibility of the press. But what real powers would the body have and how would it work? Clause 2 refers to the "distribution of newspapers". The Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Office of Fair Trading are already active in that area and investigations are currently in hand. The Bill would create a third body to poke about and make recommendations, or ex cathedra statements perhaps, which would only confuse matters, given that two official bodies already have these responsibilities. That is one of the reasons why I think that those words should be omitted. What purpose is served by a duplicate body investigating the same areas?<br><br>
I am unclear about the extent to which the Bill refers to television and radio as well as to the press. One of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
the points of the hon. Member for Hammersmith is that everything is fine with television because it is regulated and that it is just the press that needs to be sorted out. However, I do not recall that the question of Mr. Birt's salary arrangements emerged from the BBC—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeff Rooker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Perry Barr)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It probably did!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly did not hear it first on the BBC.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where does the hon. Gentleman think <i>The Independent</i> got the story from?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is interesting is that, presumably, the BBC knew more about the matter than anyone else, yet it did not say anything. It relied on the press to release the story and then ran it as its first news item. That is a strange way for the truth to emerge; it is a good illustration of the need for a free press to discover what is actually happening. If it were all regulated in the way that the hon. Gentleman secretly wants, such stories would not come out. It is strange that we should be trying to muzzle the truth. The independent press authority would work only by muzzling. I am not happy about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Government were to introduce a Bill on privacy, or proposals for an ombudsman with the power to fine, or measures to implement the Calcutt recommendations, would he vote for or against them?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have to consider them. The hon. Gentleman has raised many other issues. I am opposed to gross breaches of privacy, going into people's private property and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. My Bill would impose no pre-publication censorship whatsoever; the other three measures would. The hon. Gentleman says that he fears that my Bill would introduce restrictions. I am saying that it would not; it would correct only what was wrong. The Bills that I suspect he will vote for, at the end of the day, would all have censorship as part of their programme.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have not seen the proposals yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have, in the Calcutt report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Press Complaints Commission should pay great attention to what Calcutt says. I do not think that we should regard the latest code from the Press Complaints Commission as the end of the story. Presumably, we are at an evolutionary stage and there is no harm in pointing out to everybody—including the Press Complaints Commission—that nobody is entirely happy with the present situation.<br><br>
I have already congratulated the hon. Member for Hammersmith on his study of the subject and on being
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
brave enough to promote such a Bill in the first place. But I am not happy with the way in which—in his very honest attempt to study the issues—he has ended up with a Bill which I think, would end up muzzling the press. For example, the expose of the BBC director general's salary would not have happened had it not been for the press.<br><br>
There is a difference between newspapers and television. I do not think that we want to regulate the press to make it the same as television—the fundamental idea behind proposals in the Bill. Amendment No. 8 would remove clause 2(c) because I do not think that the proposal would work and, if it did work, it would duplicate the work of existing bodies.<br><br>
I shall discuss amendments Nos. 13 and 14 together. I do not believe that the rules, regulations, codes or standards of practice for the profession should be stipulated by the outside body that the hon. Member for Hammersmith proposes, let alone one appointed by the Government. Again, people who practise in the press should work things out more for themselves. Also, we should not limit who can operate in that area in the way the hon. Gentleman would like to.<br><br>
I write a column for the local newspapers—the "Bolton Metro News" and the <i>Bolton Evening News.</i> I do not think that the quality of my contributions would be improved if I had to register with some official body or tow the line in the way in which the Bill suggests. We want as much freedom as possible for people to contribute, either with letters or columns.<br><br>
There was delay in newspapers beginning to run columns by Members of Parliament because, at one time, the trade union said that contributions should be by trade union members only. I do not think that that was in the interests of the newspapers. I am certainly not a member of any trade union, let alone the National Union of Journalists. It was not in the interests of the newspapers' readers or the newspapers themselves to restrict who could contribute to them.<br><br>
The proposals of the hon. Member for Hammersmith could result in restrictions on who was allowed to write in a paper. The idea of a Government statutory body deciding on what is ethical is also totally wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roger Gale <span class='memberconstituency'>(Thanet, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On that narrow point, will my hon. Friend tell the Committee what evidence there is, contained anywhere in the Bill or in the amendments that he has tabled, to suggest that there would be regulations governing who could write for the press?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend reads the Bill, he will notice that one of the proposals is to monitor the ethical standards of the press and to produce and promote codes of professional and ethical standards for the press. It would only be one step from that to saying that only people who comply would be allowed to write; otherwise, how could such a regulation be enforced? If people who are contributing do not know of the regulations, how can they be expected to stand by them?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0320">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
I defer to my hon. Friend's greater knowledge and experience in this area, but I would have thought that such considerations would have made him realise that that would be the direction in which we would head.<br><br>
I know from experience with my local newspaper that there was hesitation about allowing Members of Parliament to contribute a regular column because they were not members of the National Union of Journalists. Such restrictions have been imposed, and could be imposed again.<br><br>
My contributions would no doubt benefit if I had the opportunity to study the finer arts of journalism, but many problems have to be dealt with by Members of Parliament, and it may help a newspaper to receive a contribution from a Member of Parliament who has not necessarily been trained as a journalist. I do not like the use of the word "ethical" to describe something that a Government body would determine. These matters go much deeper and should not be dealt with statutorily.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman recommend knocking such judgments out of the rules governing the BBC and commercial television?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There will eventually be less regulation of television and radio because the spectrum scarcity that prompted regulation is decreasing. Many people can receive cable television and choose between 30 or more channels. New radio stations have been proposed. There will be less regulation of radio, too.<br><br>
It is difficult to say that one does not want responsibility while promoting more freedom. If an item is broadcast over the air, it does not have much impact on those who did not hear it initially unless it is recorded or put in a transcript. A newspaper article, on the other hand, can be photocopied and distributed. I see innumerable photocopies of press cuttings, but I do not see the same number of transcripts of radio and television broadcasts. There is not the same follow up of television and radio transmissions.<br><br>
A former agriculture Minister made a statement about eggs that was repeated on innumerable occasions, but generally there is only a limited audience for radio transmissions. There is a larger audience for television programmes because there are fewer channels, but that would change if the number of channels were increased.<br><br>
I want not less responsibility but the opportunity for more freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington <span class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's interpretation is quite remarkable. Did he back Lord Rees Mogg's absurd Broadcasting Standards Council when it was proposed to the House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it was part of Government legislation, I suspect that I did.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
There is a duplication and an impossibility. Modern technology makes it increasingly difficult for a country to restrict what is seen on television or heard. That was a factor in the collapse of communism in eastern Europe. It became increasingly difficult for the communist dictatorships to restrict what their populations could see and hear. Technology means that people will have greater freedom to listen to what they want and to what they want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will find that he said earlier that he would be opposed to a Government body determining ethical standards. This authority would not be a Government body. The hon. Gentleman will also find that he voted for the Broadcasting Standards Council, which is about determining standards.<br><br>
11.15 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I was attempting to answer it by saying that it is more difficult to know what is happening on radio and on television. If an article is published in the <i>Bolton Evening News,</i> it can be faxed to me as soon as the paper hits the street. If I do not like the article, I can respond to it in whatever way seems best.<br><br>
If something is broadcast on BBC Greater Manchester Radio—GMR—or Piccadilly radio, I might not hear about it for some time. I might receive a garbled version of what was said so I might decide to ask for a copy of the recording or a transcript. That would take more time and it could be one or two weeks before I was fully aware of what was said. It would take further reflection on my part to decide whether to respond. Greater care is therefore needed because of the way in which broadcasting is monitored and because it is more difficult to respond to what is broadcast than to what is printed.<br><br>
Technology is changing and therefore the ability to impose restrictions also changes. Because of the limited number of channels, audiences for broadcasts are greater than the readership of newspapers and what is said has a much greater impact than what appears in a newspaper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman is saying is absurd. Much of what is broadcast on television is advertised beforehand. Such trailers state what programmes will contain. Many are pre-recorded. It is absurd to say that one knows in advance what will appear in a newspaper. With regard to the ethical standards of broadcasting, however, one knows what will be broadcast on television and that gives one time to prepare one's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman made some good points earlier, but that is ridiculous. I do not have any detailed knowledge of what will be broadcast on television and radio and, therefore, I do not know whether I shall object to it. One may learn that a programme is being produced and one may have a view on it, but, in general, one does not know what it will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0321">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
contain until it is broadcast. We have no knowledge of what will be broadcast about topical events.<br><br>
Valid points have been made about the extent to which one can impose ethical standards on television and radio, but one cannot make the same case for the press. It will become less and less possible to impose such standards on television and radio—and less necessary—as the audiences for each channel become smaller. The impact of television will be reduced as people will choose to watch different channels once they have the opportunity to select from 30 or more instead of from the limited number that are currently available. I accept the thrust of the earlier intervention made by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie, but not his latest point.<br><br>
Amendment No. 15 deals with training. The National Council for the Training of Journalists, which is supported by all sides of the industry, does what is widely recognised to be a good job. There are many routes into journalism and a register recording the imposition of training requirements would be a major restriction on entry to it. There was an extraordinary attempt to do that on a world scale when UNESCO proposed a register in the 1970s and 1980s. It advocated a disastrous scheme for a new world information and communication order, which sought to impose on the free-world press the censorship that was prevalent in the communist bloc. It attempted to institute a uniform code of standards and training requirements. That new world information order contributed to the departure from UNESCO of this country and the United States. That initiative, thankfully, has now collapsed, but lessons have been learnt from it and we should pay attention to them when considering the Bill.<br><br>
Those arguments explain why the Committee should accept the amendments. I hope that hon. Members will take the same view of them as they did of the earlier amendment, but that they will be more positive so that you, Mr. Hogg, do not have to use your casting vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As this is my first speech, as opposed to an intervention, in the Committee, I declare my interest as a member of several trade bodies relating to television and radio production and journalism. I am also a member of the National Union of Journalists. I apologise for the fact that parliamentary business that was already planned prevented me from attending the Committee's first sitting. It was for that reason that I exercised a no-vote on the first Division this morning. I felt it inappropriate to exercise a vote given that I had not been present to listen to the entire argument. I hope that that decision will be respected as a courtesy to colleagues.<br><br>
It is as well to place on the record an interest relating to what I describe, I hope accurately, as the News International group of amendments. I can see nothing improper in an interested party submitting considered amendments, with back-up material, but the pedigree might as well be known.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) has made a cogent case and I read with interest that, in the previous sitting, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the new IPA is to work, it will do so by preventing articles from being printed, otherwise, standards will remain as they are. I do not see that it would have any effect."—<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 3 March 1993; c. 18.]</p></blockquote>
That represents the fundamental difference between us and the reason that I shall oppose the entire News International group of amendments, although I have some sympathy with one that has not been called. I do not accept my hon. Friend's contention that the proposed agency is designed to censor the press. If I did, I should certainly, as a journalist, lend it no support.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hammersmith knows that I have some quarrel with the fine detail of the Bill. We are here to discuss that. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has also expressed reservations, which I understand and, in part, share.<br><br>
It is clear that the existing, self-regulatory body, the Press Complaints Commission, has signally failed. Its chairman has failed, as I said on Second Reading. The self-regulation has failed. That is why we are now considering the need for control, but not of the press or, as my hon. Friend tried to suggest, over who shall or shall not write for newspapers. Many of us in the NUJ have vigorously opposed our union's occasional attempts to fetter contributions to papers on the grounds that the contributor happened not to be a member of a trade union. For precisely the reasons argued by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East, we believe that people should have the right to contribute. We are concerned not about control over who contributes, but about reasonable control over ethical standards governing what is or is not proper and acceptable in a free society. The hon. Member for Hammersmith has gone a long way towards striking that balance. I do not think that it is a fish and fowl Bill, as even my right hon. Friend hinted. The two aspects, press regulation and press freedom, go hand in hand and are entirely compatible.<br><br>
The group of amendments under consideration and those that we shall shortly discuss represent a systematic attempt to neuter the Bill, to make it as ineffective as the Press Complaints Commission has been.<br><br>
I was intrigued to receive from an old friend, David Newell, the deputy director of the Newspaper Society, a letter setting out—entirely properly—that society's objections to the Bill, and an editorial from the <i>Sunderland Echo.</i> David Newell, in his letter to me, which I assume is also directed at other members of the Committee, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"A summary of the problems which the Bill creates is attached, together with an editorial from <i>The Sunderland Echo</i> which illustrates their effect."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0322">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
The <i>Sunderland Echo</i> describes the hon. Member for Hammersmith in the headline of its editorial as "A dangerous politician." Some of us might agree with that at times, but not on this occasion. Several column inches are devoted to "Labour MP Clive Soley", a "dangerously misguided" man. That editorial maintains that the paper would be unable to print such statements, although it believes them to be factually correct, if the Bill were accepted. We can argue about that in the privacy of the Tea Room.<br><br>
The editorial then ran a headline, "Censorship." As someone who lived in the north-east for some time, I had a high regard for the <i>Sunderland Echo</i> and, for many months, read it with great and glorious interest. However, the paper has suddenly made out that the Bill is all about censorship. The gloves are off, the cards are on the table and we now know where we stand. In one corner are the Members of Parliament who want to censor the press and in the other is the press which believes in the public right to know and in freedom.<br><br>
The editorial reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"A statutory tribunal set up to impose 'accuracy' would inevitably find plausible reasons to extend its control over content."</p></blockquote>
I have read the Bill carefully. I have read the proposals for an independent press authority and the schedule, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Authority shall consist of 21 members appointed by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
I cannot find reference to a statutory tribunal; if one exists, perhaps the hon. Member for Hammersmith will tell me where it is mentioned. However, the <i>Sunderland Echo</i> which, as David Newell says, illustrates the effect of the Bill, suggests, in its free, impartial and totally unbiased way, that the Bill proposes a measure that it does not even mention. There is no reference to a tribunal in the Bill. The Calcutt report suggests a tribunal, which I should oppose vigorously, but the Bill does not.<br><br>
I put to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East that, in the nicest possible way, he has been conned by some nice people at News International, who are also friends of mine. They, and the press in general, are telling many stories designed to frighten naughty children about what the Bill would do.<br><br>
We can argue about the dot and comma of the Bill's precise effect. I have reservations about the imposition on my local editor, who is a very good editor, of endless corrections. I do not want the front pages of the <i>Isle of Thanet Gazette,</i> the <i>Thanet Times</i> or the <i>Heme Bay Times</i> Smothered in corrections. Young journalists make mistakes and if every dot, comma and spelling error in every newspaper had to be corrected, heaven help us. That would require two newspapers a week: one to publish the news and the other to publish the corrections. That is not what we want. I fear that the pedants on the authority—there will be some because there always are—will try to be overzealous. That is a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
genuine worry about the creation of an independent press authority.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend said that one issue should be addressed in a speech. I have rambled a little, but the one issue for me is whether the PCC has worked. The one answer is no. The one requirement is for an alternative and the one alternative before us this morning is a fair-fisted attempt to create an independent authority. I shall resist the amendment, and any other, that would wrest power from that independent authority and place it back in the hands of a self-regulatory body which has not worked in the past and which I do not believe will work in the future.<br><br>
11.30 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: By and large, I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East is trying to do. It is important to have a body which can make the press publish a retraction on matters of fact. However, clause 2(1)(c), which deals with investigating and monitoring ethical standards of the press, sounds like big brother resurrecting his ugly head. I have an antipathy to the great and good deciding these matters on behalf of others.<br><br>
The press, like any organisation, makes mistakes and sometimes its standards are abysmal. But should a quango-like body decide what press standards should be? Those standards should be a product of practice and when the press makes a mistake, it should be corrected, mainly because ordinary people can have their lives turned upside down as a result of that mistake.<br><br>
In a free society, some newspapers may be pretty grisly and grim, but we put up with them in the interests of general freedom. Like my hon. Friend, I am not in favour of clause 2(1)(e) which proposes that the authority shall, in support of its other duties
<br><blockquote><p>"conduct research into and make recommendations on the training and education of journalists".</p></blockquote>
That should not be part of the authority's duties. If journalists want to be trained, whether on the job or in an institution, by all means let them be trained. But that proposal smacks of the journalists' union lobbying for a restriction on who can write in newspapers. I have received no communications from any one at News International—neither uncle Rupert nor cousin Kelvin has tried to influence me. I am simply expressing my views as a lay person who takes an interest in ensuring that when newspapers go over the top, they print retractions and make some kind of reparation to the people whom their articles damage.<br><br>
As I said at the preliminary hearing, a newspaper is a business like any other. To make a fast buck, newspapers sometimes go too far and do not care much who they hurt in the process. Those who are hurt should have some means of immediate or quick redress, which is one of the clause's aims. However, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East that the rest of the paraphernalia in the clause should be deleted, as he proposes. The authority should be kept
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0323">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
small and neat, with as few duties as possible, so that it hits the target and does not ramble into the areas of ethics and journalist training, which I believe to be superfluous to the main issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Thanet, North has made my job easier because he has already dealt with many of the arguments.<br><br>
I am glad that the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East tabled the amendments. I acknowledge that they cover points raised by News International, but they are none the worse for that. In the past six months, News International and I have developed an interesting relationship—editorials about the Bill have appeared in newspapers all over the country and in the national press. I believe that its views should be heard on this issue.<br><br>
I ask members of the Committee, particularly the hon. Member for Billericay, to bear in mind that the group of amendments is designed to rule out any comments on ethical behaviour by the press. That is profoundly dangerous.<br><br>
At our previous sitting, which the hon. Lady could not attend because she was elsewhere, I gave the Committee the example of the picture of the lady and the vice girl. Newspapers had bought a photograph of the prostitute who had approached the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Allan Green, approaching his wife before she committed suicide. The photograph was paid for by the press and the money either went directly to the prostitute or—what is more likely—to the pimp. I know from the record of the hon. Member for Billericay on such issues that she would regard such behaviour as extremely undesirable. If judgments of such issues are left to the press, the points that were made in my committee will rule and if something increases circulation, it will be judged okay.<br><br>
My Bill does not seek to deal with such behaviour by law because I accept the wider argument that that would involve censorship, which would have a much greater impact than is desirable. We need an independent body that is able to comment. News International, through the amendments, is trying to prevent that. I urge the hon. Lady to consider the examples that she heard on my informal committee and to agree that we should create a separate body.<br><br>
I also wish to consider the training and education of journalists. There are relatively few schools of journalism in Britain. Those that exist often do not provide courses with a strong ethical content. No one is suggesting a laid-down ethnics formula that one can use for training journalists or anyone else. However, because journalism has a profound effect on people's lives and society in general, it is important that journalists be made to think about ethical issues. That is best illustrated by the remarks a photographer made to me. He said, "I don't like climbing over people's walls to take photographs through their letter boxes or their windows, but I have to do it because I know that the newspaper wants a photograph and I won't get a job
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
otherwise". There must be ethical standards over and above those used by newspapers.<br><br>
The newspapers are not arguing that they should not be bound by ethics—they appear in their code. The Press Complaints Commission's code is full of ethical issues, as my hon. Friend the Member for Erdington pointed out. However, as with accuracy, the problem is that the newspapers want to be judge and jury. I am at one with the hon. Member for Thanet, North in thinking that the body that deals with such issues—enforcing them in the case of accuracy and commenting upon others—should not be made up of editors and owners and should not be set up by the newspaper industry.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 demonstrate the logical outcome of the concept. They show that News International still has a sense of humour, which encourages me. The amendments suggest the abolition of my proposed authority and the creation of one made up of 12 people appointed by the newspaper industry. They would create a body that is set up by the industry, take away the functions of a statutory body and give them to editors. When the hon. Member for Billericay cross-examined a witness in my committee—I think that the witness was from the Press Complaints Commission—she pointed out that newspapers had a commercial interest which overrode the ethical issues involved—precisely what News International seeks to do through the amendments.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Thanet, North was right to say that my Bill would not impose censorship of the type that the <i>Sunderland Echo</i> suggested. The <i>Sunderland Echo</i> got a number of things wrong. Its editorial, about which I have no complaints, was a matter of opinion. My opinion is different, but it expressed a legitimate argument with which I have no problems.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the editorial was factually incorrect. The editorial, which was held up by the Newspaper Society as a shining account of the problems that would be caused by the Bill, referred to provisions that patently do not appear in the Bill. That is improper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I was looking for the editorial, but I cannot find it now. The hon. Gentleman is right. The editorial certainly contained factual inaccuracies. However, I am fairly relaxed about its opinion because I can express one to counter it.<br><br>
One of the problems with the press's slightly hysterical reaction to the Bill has been such factual inaccuracies. They have read into it all sorts of things that are not there. Only a few weeks ago newspapers were referring to my Bill as a privacy Bill. For example, the <i>Daily Mail</i> did that a month ago. That is bizarre. The papers have no understanding of the measure and have not bothered to look it up. That is an example of the sloppy journalism that must be dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is characteristically too kind about the <i>Sunderland Echo.</i> Andrew Hughes, the editor, is a member of the PCC. Is that the person who is responsible for the factual inaccuracies in that paper?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0324">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not spotted that. I am grateful for that useful information which I shall bear in mind when I next look at the <i>Sunderland Echo.</i><br><br>
The issue is clear. The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East should ask News International for a better brief. The press's hysteria about the Bill comes from its inability to understand it. The press wants no regulation apart from its own. It states that the Bill is equivalent to censorship and that it would establish a body that could prevent stories from being written, in the way that the hon. Gentleman mistakenly suggested. It has also referred to privacy legislation. I could live with that if the press were better at defending press freedom when it is under threat of being eroded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the hon. Gentleman is trying to make the press more responsible. He suggested that people can be made to act unethically because they are afraid of losing their jobs. We have surely gone past that stage in this country. People cannot lose their jobs because they are made to do something unethical. If that happens, the case can be decided at a tribunal. Mechanisms exist to prevent people from being forced to behave unethically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to believe that, but the hon. Lady must bear in mind that many journalists are freelancers. Newspapers will buy pictures only if they are sufficiently salacious. The <i>Daily Mirror</i> said that it did not pay the pimp the money for which he asked. That begs the question of who paid for the photograph and who was paid in return by the agency or the freelancer.<br><br>
The hon. Lady must also bear in mind that journalists sent out on a job are told to get the story or photograph and, because they understandably want to do well in their jobs, they get it. If the hon. Lady wants proof of that, she need take it not from me, but from Kelvin MacKenzie. When he gave evidence to the Select Committee, he said that his paper would now tell the truth and later issued a press release from News International to the effect that the paper's journalists would now obey the code and anyone who did not would be dismissed. As I pointed out on Second Reading, Kelvin MacKenzie has never obeyed the code, but no one will dismiss him, unless Mr. Murdoch thinks that he went too far in releasing the Queen's Christmas message.<br><br>
The argument is much more complex. I urge the hon. Member for Billericay to consider that journalists are in a vulnerable position and many believe that they have to do certain things otherwise they will not get on as they would wish. That is overwhelmingly true of the freelance world, which increasingly dominates some of the ethical areas about which we are most anxious.<br><br>
It is not true for News International to tell the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East that the Bill is censorious and would have a draconian effect. I ask the hon. Gentleman to bear that in mind, particularly in view of what he is likely to do in future. That is why I intervened in his speech. The Government will introduce measures, perhaps on privacy, or for an ombudsman
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
with the power to fine for breach of the code, or along the lines of the Calcutt report. I guarantee that proposed legislation on any of those areas will include more censorship than is in my Bill. Given what the hon. Gentleman said today, he should vote against such proposals. However, my guess is that he will not, but will, as my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie said, vote with the Government. However, I hope that he will remember the debate and his words.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman now has the problem of being likely at another stage to vote for more censorship, rather than acting in accordance with my argument—which would benefit the press—for setting up an independent body to adjudicate on accuracy without enforcing other standards through censorship. If the Bill imposed censorship in other areas I, too, would not vote for it.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
We need the independent agency but the amendments are designed to undermine it. They would leave it in the hands not only of editors but of independent owners. That is why the issue of monopoly ownership is so important. These are not trivial matters. The hon. Member for Billericay made the important point that we need to keep the Bill as tight as possible. I agree, but the matters that I have been discussing are important because of their consequential effect on journalistic behaviour. We cannot ignore that and leave people in the front line to make decisions which are bound to be driven by their need for employment, income and so on. We must take a stand on the delicate balance between press freedom and responsibility.<br><br>
News International has an absolute right to propose the amendments, but if the Committee votes for them it is voting for a continuation of the status quo. The hope of the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East, that the PCC will regulate itself more effectively, must be the ultimate statement of the triumph of hope over experience. The hon. Gentleman is not only prepared to allow continued drinking in the last chance saloon, but what troubles me is that he is buying the rounds. It is time to call last orders in that saloon, and for the hon. Gentleman to come out and say that he has put the case for the amendments but will not press them to a vote. They do not make good sense from any point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join the hon. Member for Hammersmith in thanking my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East for enlarging the scope of the debate. I did not travel to Bolton on Saturday just to consult the <i>Bolton Evening News</i> on the amendments, although my hon. Friend, who quoted from that paper, helpfully made it possible for me to meet its representatives. They seemed primarily and properly interested in why I had supported Bolton Wanderers for the best part of the past 50 years.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North was wrong to chastise himself. Lloyd George certainly said that a speech should contain only one point, but he also said that it could be approached from several angles
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0325">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
and embellished as one liked. It was perfectly clear to me that my hon. Friend was doing that. I never had the slightest sense that he was rambling. I am grateful to him for declaring his interest as a member of the NUJ. I failed, last week, to declare to the Committee that for nine months in 1960–61,I earned a modest shilling as a part-time correspondent for <i>The Financial Times</i> in Switzerland. After 32 years, I was gratified to be brought out of retirement last month by the editor of <i>The Cricketer,</i> who asked me to write a thousand words on my favourite cricketer. [Hon. Members: "Name him."] David Gower received a passing reference.<br><br>
As I said in earlier discussions, the Government are not persuaded that there is a case for a statutory body to be required to undertake any of the duties set out in paragraphs (a) to (f) of clause 2(1). We shall set out our conclusions on the question of press regulation in the light of the present debates—which I am much enjoying—the report of the Select Commitee on National Heritage, on privacy and media intrusion, and the response of the press to Sir David Calcutt's review of press self-regulation. It may nevertheless help the Committee if, leaving that question of principle aside, I comment briefly on my hon. Friend's amendments.<br><br>
Generally speaking, we take the view that, if a statutory press body were to be created, it should be concerned only with ensuring journalistic standards and with providing a remedy for breaches of those standards. On that basis, we can give partial support to amendment No. 8, as we believe that no statutory body should be concerned with investigating and monitoring distribution of newspapers, ownership and control of the media, access to information and restrictions on reporting and any related matter that it may consider appropriate. However, we do not see why, if there were to be a statutory body, it should not be tasked to investigate and monitor ethical standards of the press, a duty which amendment No. 8 would remove.<br><br>
The proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton North-East would alter the balance of certain sentences in the clause, and we do not see why the body should not produce codes of both professional and ethical standards for the press, as well as promoting codes of ethical standards. Those duties would be removed by amendments Nos. 13 and 14.<br><br>
The amendments do not make it clear what distinction my hon. Friend draws between ethical and professional standards. Can we imagine unethical professional standards, or unprofessional ethical standards? You may rule me out of order, Mr. Hogg, but this reminded me of the question set to Professor Joad—as he then was not—when we went up to take a scholarship at Oxford. He was asked to write for three hours on the question of whether a good man can be happy on the rack. He wrote in a minute and a half the single sentence, "If he was a very good man and it was a very bad rack, yes. If not, no." For that answer, he was awarded pure Alpha. If I may return to the amendments, it is also not clear who would have the duty to produce the codes of professional standards which the independent press authority would have to promote.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
On amendment No. 15, we are not clear why my hon. Friend should be opposed to the IPA being able to conduct research into, and make recommendations on, the training and education of journalists. One can see that such a function is somewhat removed from what might be considered the main purpose of any statutory regulatory body. However, the proposal does not seem objectionable in itself.<br><br>
I have long thought that we have not served ourselves well down the years—I am speaking of the past century—by not attaching as much importance to training as other countries. A Japanese person will be totally retrained eight times in a 40-year career. My sabbatical from her Majesty's Government last summer had the same beneficial quality.<br><br>
In conclusion, although I understand and support some elements of my hon. Friend's amendments on the duties of the IPA, I do not understand the rationale for all of them and cannot therefore support them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to correct the impression held by the hon. Member for Erdington about the involvement of News International. These are not the views of News International alone. I have had the opportunity to look at my papers. The hon. Member for Hammersmith was unable earlier to find something among his papers and I sympathise with him, because although I have only a fraction of his documentation, it takes a moment or two to fish out what I want.<br><br>
My reference goes back to 1947, when Peter Carter-Ruck earned his first shilling by defending the <i>Bolton Evening News.</i> That was his first libel case and I understand that he was successful, although the present editor cannot personally recall it. However, that just shows how long we have been concerned with these issues.<br><br>
As I have said, the amendments do not reflect the views of News International alone. In the <i>Bolton Evening News</i> of 11 January, an editorial which referred to the Calcutt report also referred to
<br><blockquote><p>"Clive Soley MP, father of the monstrous Freedom and Responsibility of the Press Bill".</p></blockquote>
The views expressed earlier are not simply those of News International; they are those of the press as a whole.<br><br>
I have had numerous representations from various bodies. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hammersmith has also received the press release entitled "Blindfolding the Watchdog", produced by the Guild of British Newspaper Editors and the Newspaper Society. The society has written me several letters saying that it would be happy to provide assistance with the drafting of amendments and so on. We must not believe that only one small corner of the press is interested in the measure.<br><br>
I was especially bothered by the press release of the Newspaper Society dated 17 February, under the headline "Newspaper campaigns under threat". It said that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0326">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
the Bill could limit the ability of local newspapers to serve their communities. I cannot recall the exact words of the hon. Member for Hammersmith, but I understood him to say that editors did not know what they were talking about. That remark was arrogant. Such people earn their living by producing newspapers and, naturally, they are concerned about the job that they do. Editors bear the responsibilities that the hon. Gentleman wants to place on an independent press authority, yet he dismisses them and says that they do not know what they are talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a gross misrepresentation of what I said. I did not say that editors did not know what they were talking about. Incidentally, I accept that editors generally are worried by my Bill. My complaint, however, is that, although they have expressed concern publicly about the gagging of the press, they do not express the same concern about Acts of Parliament that do gag the press. For example, the press made no complaints about the prevention of terrorism Act that put a journalist in court and led to the judge warning that, if there were any more such instances, journalists would go to gaol.<br><br>
If a regulatory body is proposed to consist of people other than members of the press, the press become hysterical. It might have have been my use of the word "hysterical" that was in the hon. Gentleman's mind. Editors are not good enough at protecting press freedom when it is threatened and overtaken by Acts of Parliament. They are not willing, however, to accept an organisation that will regulate them independently.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That sums up the difference between the hon. Gentleman and myself. Editors are acutely aware of the problem, and the right way in which to regulate them might be specific measures, such as the protection of terrorism Act, on which there could be a consensus among all parties on what should be done. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has had great experience in that area. It is better to agree on specific restrictions when our national freedom is affected than to pass an all-embracing Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gale</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fundamental difference between my hon. Friend and those of us who are broadly in favour of the principle of the measure is that we believe that a post-publication regulation is the only way forward that will not censor the press. Others wish to introduce measures that would go back to the bad old days of gagging writs—the writs that we are told protected Maxwell. Last week, my hon. Friend said that the Bill was designed to prevent publication.<br><br>
I hope that having set down its guidelines, a regulatory body would have no work to do. It would keep a watching brief. BBC journalists used to have BBC guidelines and if written-word journalists have instilled into them the Kelmsley "manual of journalism", the authority would have almost no work to do. I suggest to my hon. Friend that that is a far cry from an organisation that the Newspaper Society and others believe will gag them before publication. They are frightened that that will happen, but that is censorship—the Bill is not.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I followed the remarks of my hon. Friend, but I believe that he said that, hopefully, the authority would have no work to do. That is a frightening prospect. In a democracy with a free press, there will be continuous debate about whether something should or should not be printed. I cannot imagine a world in which the statutory body, if it were set up, would have nothing to do. Such a position would be terrifying; it would lead to a communist state where no one dared to print anything that might upset anyone. In a healthy democracy, such a statutory body would be busy. The idea of it having nothing to do is incredible. I am unhappy about such an authority, however, because of its threatened interference.<br><br>
The intervention of the hon. Member for Hammersmith was along his general line that we should accept the Bill, because the alternative might be worse—the fear of auntie [Hon. Members: "nurse".]<br><br>
Yes, the fear of nursie. The hon. Gentleman says that his Bill is all right, it has a wonderful title, we should stop worrying and accept it and everything will be fine. However, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State knows that it would be a step in the wrong direction, which is why I oppose the Bill.<br><br>
I am taking advantage of representations that I have received. I shall be pleased to give copies to other hon. members. The hon. Member for Hammersmith cannot lightly brush off a whole page in the <i>Bolton Evening News</i> headed "Paralysed by venom".<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
This is not some nice little Bill. It is a step down a road that we should not take. The hon. Member for Hammersmith has done well to raise the issues, which are vital to our democracy. He would, I think, agree with the second half of the article in the <i>Bolton Evening News,</i> which I shall be happy to pass to him. The article, entitled <i>"Press watchdog faces stiff test"</i>, is by Lord McGregor. The good coming out of the hon. Gentleman's proposals and the ensuing debate is the fact that they have forced the Press Complaints Commission to take its duties seriously. The issues cannot be ignored.<br><br>
We shall have to wait and see whether other proposals are forthcoming, whether nurse comes up with something worse and whether there is to be an ombudsman with the power to fine. The role of the ombudsman requires much more discussion. Giving him the power to impose fines would be a step down the same road as the hon. Member for Hammersmith is proposing to take. The Lord Chancellor has made representations about that possibility to the Select Committee. I do not share the hon. Gentleman's conviction that we should accept the Bill because something worse might be in store for us.<br><br>
I seek your advice, Mr. Hogg. I do not know whether this is the right time for me to, say how I think we should deal with the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the conclusion of the debate, I shall put the Question on amendment No. 8. We shall

vote on or dispose of the others when we reach them. What is the hon. Gentleman's intention on amendment No. 8?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to have a vote on amendment No. 8, but not on amendments Nos. 13, 14 and 15.<br><br>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 5, leave out "Parliament" and insert "the Secretary of State".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 17, in page 2, line 6, leave out "either House of Parliament" and insert "the Secretary of State".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates to whether the proposed body should report annually to Parliament and consider matters referred to it by Parliament. The amendment provides that reports should be made to the Secretary of State rather than to Parliament, as it is unusual for a non-governmental body to report direct to Parliament. Although the Bill is full of good intentions, there are question marks about whether the authority be non-governmental and how it should operate. If a non-governmental authority is established, it should report to the Secretary of State and consider matters referred to it by him, rather than, uniquely, reporting direct to Parliament and considering matters that Parliament refers to it. That relates to the points that I made earlier.<br><br>
The Bill sounds fine, but when we come down to considering the functions of the proposed body, its power to carry out those functions and the sort of animal that it will be, it becomes apparent that we are considering a hybrid. The hon. Member for Hammersmith cannot quite make up his mind whether the body should do what Parliament tells it or whether it should be free. The PCC is the body that is required. It should perform its duties as effectively and efficiently as possible. We should not produce a somewhat strange animal and imagine that it can do the PCC's job.<br><br>
I do not intend to press my point, but I feel that if a body is established, it should report to the Secretary of State and consider matters referred to it by him rather than consider a strange deliberation of Parliament. If the body is to work, it has to be clear about what it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
doing. Parliament is not always best at making clear what is and is not required, particularly about such a complex matter. The points made in Committee are bound to recur.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can be brief because News International would gain from the amendment. There is a need for a rethink about the brief that the hon. Gentleman has been given. The problem is not as great as he said. Reporting to Parliament is traditional, but for the press to argue against being under the Government's control and then make the point about reporting to the Secretary of State is schizophrenic, as the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East knows. The authority ought to report to Parliament. The Secretary of State is a member of the Government, and the Government only have Parliament's confidence if they can win a vote in Parliament. We are familiar with our parliamentary system and our constitution. Reporting to Parliament is best and would give a role to Select Committees, which could examine reports at length.<br><br>
My suggestion is to give power to Back Benchers. It is better for Parliament and the press that reports are made to Parliament, rather than just to the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State would be able to make recommendations, as would any other Member of Parliament. There is not a problem. The newspapers that put the amendment together probably do not understand the constitutional aspects of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have almost reached the stage at which I need not repeat that we have yet to decide whether there should be statutory arrangements for the regulation of the press. If there were to be statutory controls, we would want to establish a body with a more balanced remit than that proposed in the Bill. For that reason, I cannot support the clause or my hon. Friend's amendment.<br><br>
I am not entirely in agreement with the hon. Member for Hammersmith. If an organisation, such as the IPA, were to be set up, we would expect it to report to Parliament rather than to me. That would be in line with arrangements in most statutory regulations. It is widely thought that all Secretaries of States have huge ambitions to increase their powers. When I was Paymaster General, someone drew my attention to a quotation from the The Mikado. Pooh-Bah says of his various powers, that when he was Paymaster General he was so able to complicate the accounts that, as Lord High Auditor, he was unable to see what he had done. I have never shared Pooh-Bah's ambitions. That said, there is merit in the idea—contained in amendment No. 17—of vesting in the Secretary of State, rather than in Parliament, the power to refer matters to the IPA for consideration. The danger is that a power given to Parliament to refer matters might be open to abuse and would encourage the IPA to stray further from the central duties of its remit on press standards and the abuse of those standards.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I defer to the judgment of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. He is the only member of the Cabinet who is a master of business
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0328">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
administration, and the only member of the Cabinet who has been appointed to it twice. There must be a moral somewhere in that. I am sure that he is best able to determine how such an organisation should report. I am glad that he thinks that amendment No. 17 would be the better way of proceeding if the Bill were to become an Act. I do not wish to press amendment No. 16 further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 16, after "Session", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or, in Northern Ireland, the Supreme Court,"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendment:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 5, in clause 9 page 3, line 8, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2) This Act shall come into force on such day as the Secretary of State shall by order provide, exercisable by statutory instruments:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) An order under subsection (2) shall not be made unless a draft of the statutory instrument containing it has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 3, in clause 9, page 3, line 37, at beginning insert "(1)".</p>
<p>No. 4, in clause 9, page 3, line 38, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2)This Act shall come into force on 1st January 1994.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3) This Act shall extend to Northern Ireland.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sincerely hope that there will be no objection to amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 4.<br><br>
Amendment No. 2 would ensure that the Bill applies to Northern Ireland and amendment No. 3 is technical. Evidence was given to the committee that I set up by people from Northern Ireland that suggested that it is right to extend the Bill. The Secretary of State was interested in a case in which someone's life was threatened as a result of an inaccurate story. We felt that it was right to make the Bill apply to the whole of the United Kingdom. That is the essence of amendment No. 2, which has consequences for other amendments.<br><br>
I shall leave it to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) to speak to amendment No. 5. Amendment No. 4 provides for the Bill to come into effect on 1 January 1994. It seemed appropriate to state a date on which the Bill would become an Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being in Committee most of the time. Unfortunately, I am a member of the Committee considering the Hedgerows Bill. We do not seem to be making much progress in either Committee.<br><br>
I tabled amendment No. 5 to obtain more information on the Government's view. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith for promoting the Bill. I believe that while the Bill has been under discussion there have been some signs of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
improvement in the press. My impression is that many more apologies and corrections are appearing in the papers.<br><br>
I fear that if the Bill does not progress further, the press will relapse. Obviously they are under considerable pressure from other sources such as the National Heritage Select Committee and the Minister. There is a feeling that this is the last chance for the press to get things right. I proposed an amendment which would ensure that the sword of Damocles continues to hang over the press's head for some time. If amendment No. 5 were made, there would be no need to make its provisions work until it had been shown yet again that self-regulation does not work. Only then would the Secretary of State provide regulation.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
I am one of those who is pretty critical of Parliament giving Ministers lots of powers under regulations. Both houses of Parliament, under new clause 1, would have to approve the regulations and they would lapse unless they had been reinforced. New clause 1, however, was not selected. That mechanisms would have allowed us to maintain pressure on the press, which would have had to continue to demonstrate to us that self-regulation was the way once the pressure of the Bill and the various reports had been removed. There are attractions in the provision, and we hope that self-regulation works and that imposed regulation is never necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should add a footnote to what my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East said at the end of our previous debate. He made some kind biographical observations about me. There are several retreads in the Government. My right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) returned after a period away, as did my right hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. Goodlad). My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) also returned, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, West (Lord James Douglas-Hamilton).<br><br>
I shall not remotely question your judgment, Mr. Hogg, in your selection of amendments. I think that I understand, from the manner in which they were tabled, why we are considering them together, but they deal with rather different matters. As the Government do not support the Bill—for the Nth time of asking—we cannot logically support its extension to Northern Ireland. It would be somewhat Irish of us to do so. We therefore oppose amendments Nos. 2 and 4, although we understand and sympathise with the reasons of the hon. Member for Hammersmith for tabling them.<br><br>
We could not support a date of commencement of 1 January 1994, or any other fixed date, for a Bill that we consider wholly unsatisfactory. We also have considerable reservations about the idea of making the commencement date subject purely to Government decision, which is implied by the amendment of the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the right hon. Gentleman's argument. Will he respond to the comments of my hon.

Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish concerning the importance of ensuring that the press does something? The Secretary of State has made it clear that he does not support my Bill, but he wants improvement in the press. There is still a feeling that the Government have no policy—they are just waiting in the hope that something will turn up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is asking me whether I would choose amendment No. 4 or amendment No. 5. If I had to choose one of them, the answer is that I would choose amendment No. 5.<br><br>

ADJUDICATION OF COMPLAINTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 2, line 44, after "and", insert "representatives of".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss amendment No. 23, in clause 6, page 3, line 19, leave out "redress other than".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I am a little confused about the fact that amendments Nos. 21 and 23 are grouped together. Is it right to take amendment No. 23 now given that it relates to clause 6?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press me on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I defer to such experienced judgment that it is quite normal to consider an amendment to clause 6 when debating clause 5.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did just that on clause 2, when he spoke to amendments that related to later clauses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pefectly normal process, if it is relevant to a Committee's consideration of a Bill. Amendment No. 23 will be debated now, but decided upon later. It will be put formally when we reach the relevant change. I hope that I have explained that—at least to my satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Hogg. I am not in the habit of being called out of order, but this must be the first time that I have queried whether the Chairman was in order. I am glad to hear that all is well.<br><br>
We are considering a minor point. Clause 5 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In determining the question of factual inaccuracy, the Authority shall take account of any evidence put forward by the complainant and the editor or publisher of the newspaper concerned".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the amendment will be acceptable to the hon. Member for Hammersmith. It would provide that a representative could stand in place of the editor at an oral hearing. The practicalities of the matter are such that it would seem strange that the editor or publisher of a newspaper could not be represented to answer questions. It may not be possible, or convenient for the editor himself to be present at a hearing for every minor complaint that could arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must query that. I regard the amendment as being rather foolish from the point of view of the newspapers, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman has been told something of which I am not aware.<br><br>
I do not have wide-ranging advice from lawyers and others on the matter, but my interpretation of the amendment is that editors could send a lawyer. The worst of all outcomes would be to include lawyers in the process because the whole idea of the Bill, is to make the complaints procedure cheap, effective and easy rather than one of long, draw-legal battles. My understanding of the amendment is that lawyers could be sent in and, if that is what is intended, I cannot believe that it would be in anyone's interests. If the hon. Gentleman has had different advice, I should like to hear it before I comment further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am little disappointed by the hon. Gentleman's comments because his proposal seems quite impractical. The representation that I have received in relation to amendment No. 21 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"It might not always be possible or practical for the editor of a newspaper to attend oral hearings. This amendment enables the editor to designate a representative most probably a senior member of editorial staff, to represent him or her in the IPA's procedures."</p></blockquote>
It would be unreasonable and impractical to suggest that an editor should attend all those meetings
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0330">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
because, if he did so, how could he continue to edit his newspaper? If the hon. Member for Hammersmith expects editors to act with full responsibility, I do not see how they could be responsible for their newspapers if they spent all their time attending such hearings. It would be unreasonable not to allow representatives of editors—my briefing note suggests that they could be members of editorial staff rather than lawyers—to attend them.<br><br>
The amendment is simple and straightforward. I am disappointed that the hon. Gentleman feels that he should resist it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I thought that the amendment would have the effect that the hon. Gentleman suggests, I would agree with him. There is no reason why editors or owners could not send their managing editors or other staff of a similar level to oral hearings. They would not send journalists. I do not want editors to be able to send lawyers to those hearings, but that is what the amendment would allow. We have argued that lawyers should not be involved in the process because that would result in long, drawn-out legal battles, enormous expense and the question of whether to grant legal aid to complainants or to leave them unrepresented before the IPA. It would be deadly to go down that road and I cannot believe that it is what either the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East or editors want. That is what the amendment, however, would achieve because editors could send anyone to the hearings and they would most likely choose lawyers in order to make life difficult. They would pay the newspapers' lawyers to attend the hearings for a day. That would be disastrous for everyone because it would make the process expensive and time consuming.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that my advice is that the amendment would allow editors or owners to send whoever they thought was appropriate to deal with complaints. I am therefore content to leave the clause as it stands.<br><br>
Amendment No. 23 also puzzles me because it seems to suggest that newspaper editors and owners have not thought about the matter. It would delete from clause 6(3) the words
<br><blockquote><p>"to obtain redress other than a correction under section 3".</p></blockquote>
For the sake of those who proposed the amendment to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East, I shall explain that the purpose of the clause is to enable a conciliation process to take place. For example, an editor may feel strongly that a correction is not justified although he accepts that an article may have shown bias or had unfortunate implications. In those circumstances, the publication of a letter from a complainant might provide appropriate conciliation in the view of the IPA.<br><br>
The alternative redress is designed to make it clear to the press that the Bill does not propose an either-or solution—a correction or nothing. The IPA can oper-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 72</span>
ate to bring about conciliation between a complainant and an editor by saying, "The complainant has a point but it may not call for a full correction. However, the editor might like to consider doing the following." If those words were deleted from the clause, as the amendment would provide, that conciliation approach, which is important for newspapers and complainants, would be impossible to adopt. I hope that the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East will not press the amendments for the reasons that I have given.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I owe you an apology, Mr. Hogg, because in all the excitement about whether we were considering clause 5 or clause 6, I omitted to speak to amendment No. 23. Perhaps you will allow me to do so in the form of an intervention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may speak to amendments as often as he likes. He may speak a second time, although that is not something that the Chairman usually recommends. When the hon. Member for Hammersmith has finished his speech, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will speak to amendment No. 23 and, at the conclusion of the debate, tell me what he wants to do with both amendments—whether he wants the Committee to divide on them.<br><br>
12.30 pm</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall conclude—on the grounds that the hon. Gentleman may speak if he wants to.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East wish to speak to amendment No. 23? I have lost track of who is speaking and who is intervening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—I thought that I was intervening, whereas in fact the hon. Member for Hammersmith had finished.<br><br>
I should like to speak to amendment No. 23. Representations have been made to me that the question of redress might well lead to fines. What would happen if fines were not paid? It is not clear exactly what is meant by other forms of redress. It has been put to me that they could mean fines. If such fines were not paid, suspension or—conceivably—imprisonment of journalists could follow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is fantasy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Well, we seem to be living in two different worlds. I read in my local newspaper that the press fear that they could be paralysed—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are discussing what is in the hon. Gentleman's local paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hammersmith and other Labour members of the Committee say, "Oh, the Bill is Okay. Redress is just a little word; you needn't worry about it." There is an arrogant attitude that the press do not know what they are talking about; that they ought to accept the Bill because there is no problem about it, and that the word
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0331">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
"redress" does not mean anything. The press have looked at the Bill and thought the matter through a bit more fully than—if not the hon. Member for Hammersmith, who may be being a little disingenuous, other Labour members of the Committee.<br><br>
If redress is refused, where will the matter end? I am advised that people fear further problems. There is no provision in the Bill to allow the proposed independent press authority to award redress, which would presumably be financial, so a newspaper could simply refuse to negotiate and insist on a published correction. To avoid unnecessary complications and confusion, the reference to other forms of redress should be removed from the Bill. I urge the Committee to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I should feel sorry for the hon. Gentleman or a bit frustrated. I do not blame the press. The lawyer who wrote his brief must live in cloud-cuckoo-land. No provision of the Bill will allow the independent press authority to impose a fine. There would have to be a clause that gave a power to fine. There is no such clause; I should not have allowed it to be included; I should have voted against it myself. The parrot is well and truly dead—indeed, it was never alive in the first place.<br><br>
The only way I can explain the hon. Gentleman's difficulty, which I presume has resulted from some legal briefing, is in terms of clause 2. It contains a power to enforce the correction of inaccuracy, but only through a court. The independent press authority could not enforce it. Only the court could do that, but it could only make the paper publish a correction. As I shall explain, the court is a safeguard for the press, too. If an editor said that he did not wish to publish a correction, he would be able to go to court to present his case. A hearing would take place and, under my Bill, an editor or newspaper would be fined only after undergoing all the procedures and leaving the independent press authority. The authority would not judge the case and the editor would go to court. If the court said that the editor must publish a correction and the editor decided to ignore that, under the contempt of court rule a fine would be imposed.<br><br>
That would not involve the redress provision in clause 6(3) because it contains no power to fine. The independent press authority would have no power to fine, imprison, torture, hang, flog or anything else. It would have no power besides the power to adjudicate on accuracy and to put that type of case before a court. The redress provision was inserted in the Bill to enable a conciliation process to take place. The evidence is strong that the vast majority of complaints would be sorted out without a great battle and without going through the complaints procedure. The press would recognise that something should be done about complaints. At the moment, they ignore them.<br><br>
The independent press authority would adjudicate on the small number of cases that came before it. In the tiny number of cases in which the editor does not agree with the decision, the editor as well as the complainant
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
would have the safeguard of going to court. That right is contained in clause 4, but it would not give the independent press authority the right to fine. I am not being arrogant; lawyers drew up the Bill, but I told them that I did not want it to contain anything that would impose censorship or give the power to fine or to send editors to prison. I made that abundantly clear. The court would be there to adjudicate on accuracy and the editor could choose to take a case before it.<br><br>

<p>"<i>The Independent Press Appointments Committee</i></p>
<p>1. The Authority shall be constituted in accordance with the following provisions.</p>
<p>2. The Secretary of State shall appoint seven persons who shall constitute the Appointments Committee hereinafter referred to as "the Committee") who shall be responsible for the appointment of the members to the Council of the Authority. The Secretary of State shall thereafter appoint such persons necessary to replace those members who cease for whatever reason to serve on the Committee so that the Committee shall at all times be convened with seven members.</p>
<p>3. Before appointing a person to be a member of the Committee the Secretary of State shall satisfy himself that that person will have no such financial or other interest as is likely to effect prejudicially the discharge by him or her of his or her functions as a member of the Committee; and the Secretary of State shall satisfy himself from time to time with respect to every member of the Committee that he or she has no such interest.</p>
<p>4. Each member of the Committee may serve for a maximum of five years as a member of the Committee. No member shall serve on the Committee beyond the fifth anniversary of his or her appointment to the Committee.</p>
<p>5. The members of the authority shall receive no remuneration for serving on the Committee.</p>
<p>6. The Committee members shall appoint one of their number to be the Chairman of the Committee for a term of two years. A person so appointed may serve up to two terms as Chairman provided that no person's service as Chairman shall extend beyond the fifth anniversary of that person's appointment to the Committee.</p>
<p>7. The sole responsibility of the Committee shall be from time to time to appoint persons as members to the Council of the Authority.</p>
<p>8. No person shall be considered for appointment who is:—
<ol>
<li>A member of Parliament.</li>
<li>A member of the House of Lords who holds a ministerial position.</li>
<li>An employer, partner, co-director or employee of any member of the Committee.</li>
<li>An ancestor, sibling or descendant of any member of the Committee.</li>
<li>Presently serving or subject to a term of imprisonment or a suspended sentence of imprisonment or is unrehabilitated within the terms of the Rehabilitated Offenders Act 1974.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p><i>Appointment of the Authority</i></p>
<p>9. The Committee shall within three months of its inaugural meeting select and appoint to serve on the Council of the Authority 21 persons.</p>
<p>10. The Committee shall from time to time thereafter select and appoint within 30 days of the vacancy occurring on the Council of the Authority such person or persons to the Council of the Authority as shall be required to maintain at 21 the number of members of the Council of the Authority.</p>
<p>11. The Committee shall invite nominations for membership of the Council of the Authority from all bodies and concerns involved or interested in the promotion of free speech and all the rights of individuals in a democratic society.</p>
<p>12. A person shall be appointed to serve on the Council of the Authority if, when nominated, he or she receives the vote of not less than 5 members of the Committee.</p>
<p>13. Save as otherwise expressly provided under this Section no person may serve on the Council beyond the eighth anniversary of his or her appointment to the Council of the Authority.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
<p>14. 11 of the initial appointees of the Council of the Authority shall be entitled to serve an initial term of eight years as a member of the Council. The remaining initial appointees shall be entitled only to serve an initial term of 4 years on the Council. The initial length of term of an appointee shall be determined by lot.</p>
<p>15. A member of the Council may be appointed immediately following the expiry of his or her term but may not serve on the Council for a period in aggregate of more than 16 years.</p>
<p>16. Any person who is or whom the Committee proposes to appoint as a member of the Council of the Authority shall whenever requested by the Secretary of State to do so furnish the Secretary of State with such information as the Secretary of State considers necessary for the performance by that member of his or her duties.".</p>
<p>Amendment No. 10, in page 4, line 4, leave out "the Secretary of State" and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"representatives of the newspaper publishing industry".</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Amendment No. 12, in page 4, leave out lines 6 to 10.</p>
<p>I should point out that we have just over 15 minutes of business time left. I understand that the hon. Member hopes to conclude business this morning. I intend to extend the sitting by 15 minutes—which I am permitted to do—if we have not achieved that by 1 o'clock. I am sure, however, that we shall achieve it by then.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have every confidence that we shall achieve that, and I shall be brief.<br><br>
Some concern was expressed by the press that the body should not be set up directly by the Secretary of State, so that statutory regulation could be avoided. I hope that hon. Members, especially the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East, realise that I listen a great deal to press concerns. I have said on many occasions—I do not seek to repeat it at length now—that such a system has worked well in the past for television and radio. No one has complained about that, or said that the BBC and ITV have been made less free or less able to undertake investigative journalism and other programmes of that nature.<br><br>
Although the system has worked well, it seems fair to concede to the press, if they felt more comfortable about it, that the body should be at arm's length. The amendment therefore gives a duty to the Secretary of State to appoint an appointments commission, which would then appoint its members. That is a safeguard for the press. All else follows from that, including the body's constitution and duties.<br><br>
The amendment is self-explanatory. I do not need to spell it out in great detail. It is a gesture to the press, who were worried about the Secretary of State having direct power. As I have said on several occasions, it would not trouble me too much to stay with the original drafting of the Bill, as it has worked well for television. In fairness to the press, however, the amendment seeks to include the arm's length option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. Are we discussing amendments Nos. 9, 7, 10, 11 and 12 together?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0333">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we are debating the amendments as a group.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Hammersmith was commenting only on amendment No. 7. I do not know whether his comments also applied to the other amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me clarify the position. The hon. Gentleman moved amendment No. 9 and explained that the other amendments were consequential on it. The principle was set out in amendment No. 9, so he discussed only that.<br><br>
12.45 pm</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are going around in circles. The hon. Member for Hammersmith is trying to have his cake and eat it. He does not want it to be seen that the Secretary of State would still have powers. If I understand the amendments correctly, the ultimate power would remain in the hands of the Secretary of State. It is surprising that the Opposition should argue for that. The hon. Gentleman characterised my attitude as schizophrenic, but he has the same difficulty. He wants to have it both ways, and the amendment does not clarify matters.<br><br>
In evidence to the special committee the editor of <i>The Guardian</i> stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"I can think of no new statute during my 17 years as editor which has enhanced press freedom. Always the reverse. And my experience, after five years of service on the board of the International Press Institute, monitoring press freedoms around the world, is exactly similar."</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that we can have a perfect world. My hon. Friend the Member for Thanet, North, who is not with us at present, conjured up a Utopia where that board would have nothing to do. That is highly unlikely. As Lord Jacobson famously said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Relations between the government and the press have deteriorated, are deteriorating, and ought under no circumstances to be improved."</p></blockquote>
That seems to be the status quo. I do not believe that the authority would ever have nothing to do in the democracy in which we live.<br><br>
The workings of the statutory body would be subject to continual tension. The proposed body of 21 members would be unwieldy and bureaucratic. A dozen governors are probably too many—that, I believe, is the number of governors of the BBC. The first Calcutt report said that 25 members were too many for the old Press Council. How did the hon. Member for Hammersmith arrive at the figure of 21? It has been suggested to me that 12 might be a more suitable number. I have always thought that the ideal committee consisted of only one person. I understand that the original definition of the word "committee" in the context of Standing Committees was a single clerk, to whom Bills were referred. A committee of 21 members would be monstrously inefficient. Even if the number were reduced to 12, it would hardly function with proper efficiency.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
Amendment No. 20 deals with ombudsmen. All national newspapers now have an ombudsman or a readers' representative to deal with complaints against them. Newspaper ombudsmen are respected in the industry and have the authority and access necessary to investigate complaints. If it is clear that a mistake has been made and the ombudsman can resolve the matter to the satisfaction of the complainant, surely that is preferable to involving the machinery of a statutory body, which would inevitably be time consuming and expensive? It would be rational to ensure that all avenues of complaint to a newspaper had been exhausted before involving the IPA. That is the aim of amendment No. 20.<br><br>
I have received representations from people who work in the newspaper industry and they continue to express their unhappiness about the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise one brief point with a view to your accepting, Mr. Hogg, a manuscript amendment to amendment No. 7. Paragraph 8 of the amendment to schedule 1 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"No person shall be considered for appointment who is:—(1) A member of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
There is no such person: Members of Parliament include Members of the Commons and of the Lords. The correct term is:
<br><blockquote><p>"A member of the House of Commons."</p></blockquote>
As it stands, that sub-paragraph does not make sense given what comes in the next one. We do not want to have to introduce amendments on Report, so will you, Mr. Hogg, accept a manuscript amendment to that effect?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East for not being clear about what I was doing, but I was considering the amendment about which the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr has just spoken. I am prepared to accept the manuscript amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) for his necessary manuscript amendment.<br><br>
I regard amendments Nos. 10, 11 and 12, tabled by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East, as a product of News International's sense of humour, because it wants to appoint the agency itself. The amendments would permit the newspaper industry to do that. Where have we heard that before? Does anyone here believe that that works? It is not convincing and I do not suggest that we pursue that further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington intends to speak to the amendments, but he took a different view at one time. During discussions on the Broadcasting Bill, he opposed the Secretary of State's power to appoint members of the Channel 4 board and said that although that method was used for the BBC governors, that was no defence for an inherently bad principle.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington will remember well what he said. There is no similarity with this Bill, which maintains that self-regulation has not worked. I can pray in aid the Secretary of State and many Conservative Members. The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East would have the newspaper industry appoint the agency, but we have all said that that has not worked so far. Therefore, there is no reason for allowing it to make such appointments now. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Erdington would not dispute that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall leave it at that because it is seven minutes to one o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Hammersmith knows, we are in good shape regarding time.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
Amendments Nos. 9 and 7 improve the Bill, as they would distance the IPA from the Government by requiring that the IPA is appointed by an appointments committee, itself appointed by the Secretary of State. That is close to, but not identical with, the Calcutt proposals. We have reservations about the detail, but given the time, I shall not trouble the Committee with them. I have similar difficulties with amendments No. 10, 11 and 12 to those expressed by the hon. Member for Hammersmith.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 7, in page 4, line 3, at end insert—</p>

<p>3. Before appointing a person to be a member of the Committee the Secretary of State shall satisfy himself that that person will have no such financial or other interest as is likely to effect prejudicially the discharge by him or her of his or her functions as a member of the Committee; and the Secretary of State shall satisfy himself from time to time with respect to every member of the Committee that he or she has no such interest.</p>

<p>12. A person shall be appointed to serve on the Council of the Authority if, when nominated, he or she receives the vote of not less than 5 members of the Committee.</p>
<p>13. Save as otherwise expressly provided under this Section no person may serve on the Council beyond the eighth anniversary of his or her appointment to the Council of the Authority.</p>
<p>14. 11 of the initial appointees of the Council of the Authority shall be entitled to serve an initial term of eight years as a member of the Council. The remaining initial

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Soley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I wish to thank you for chairing the Committee and the Secretary of State for attending. I advise the Secretary of State that when he called for a vote against the Bill's coming into force date of 1 January 1994, I suddenly found a secret supporter. My hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr knows more about such matters than I do and he assures me that if a Bill does not have a coming into force date, it comes into force with Royal Assent. It will therefore come into force sooner rather than later.<br><br>
I also thank all other members of the Committee for their work and help and the staff of the House of Common for their assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Brooke</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Apart from the references to myself, Mr. Hogg, I merely repeat what was said after a long speech in the 18th century by the great Edmund Burke when an hon. Member rose and said, "Ditto to Mr. Burke." I say the same.</span></p>
