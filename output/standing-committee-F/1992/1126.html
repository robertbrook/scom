<div class='page-header'><h1>Trade Union Reform and Employment<br><br> Rights Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That during proceedings on the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and half-past Four o'clock.<br><br>
In moving the motion I welcome you, Mr. Knox, to the Committee as our Chairman. I understand that the Committee is to have two Chairmen, both of whom are senior and respected Members of Parliament. I shall give an equally warm welcome to your partner, if I may call him that, when the opportunity arises.<br><br>
I do not want to detain the Committee for very long on this matter. We intend to sit initially on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and on Tuesday afternoons only. We shall keep our progress under review, but I hope that we shall conclude consideration of the Bill without having to extend our sittings. I hope that the debate will be constructive. The Government want to listen to the arguments and to take on board convincing suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman got the sittings motion slightly wrong. Will he formally move it as it appears on the Amendment Paper? The Committee cannot sit this afternoon. The hon. Gentleman must read out the reference to Tuesday 1 December.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox. I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and, with effect from Tuesday 1 December, at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I am grateful to you, Mr. Knox, for drawing that error to my attention.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would have been here on his own if the motion had not been corrected.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Knox, to the Chair. Over the years you and I have spent more time in each others company than we probably ought, but it was in public and we were both consenting adults.<br><br>
The Opposition do not want artificially to protract the Committee's proceedings, We do, however, want the Bill to be considered carefully. As members on both sides the Committee know, there are certain provisions that we find wholly objectionable and, that we should like to be removed or amended. There are other provisions that, to say the least, could be improved.<br><br>
Some of the provisions for trade union reform in the first part of the Bill are wrong in principle. Others, however, are acceptable in principle. The practicalities of the details of the proposals could cause considerable administrative and bureaucratic difficulties and could lead to the incurring of expense by trade unions. In many cases, greater expense
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
could be incurred by their employers. On the assumption that some of the botheration is deliberate, we assume that some of the botheration is not deliberate. Therefore we hope during Committee to persuade the Government to reconsider some of the detailed aspects of the Bill in order to make it more workable.<br><br>
Later parts of the Bill will need to be strengthened and carefully scrutinised.<br><br>
The objectives of the amendments will be to establish the points that we shall try to make. Neither my hon. Friends nor myself are wedded to any wording in particular. From the outset I want to make it clear that if the Minister accepts the points that we shall try to make, we shall be more than happy to get a better wording, if there is one, from his officials.<br><br>
We should like the Bill to be dealt with thoroughly but briskly. By the end of the Committee stage we hope that it will be a better Bill. It will not be a good Bill because it starts off on the wrong foot. Short of Labour having a majority, the best that we can hope for is to proceed with the Bill briskly and briefly.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock and, with effect from Tuesday 1 December, at half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the order of consideration motion, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, copies of which are available in the Room. I call attention also to the fact that adequate notice should be given of amendments. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments.<br><br>
I should also advise the Committee that I have received a letter from Miss Hales, the principal assistant editor of <i>Hansard</i> for Standing Committees. The letter states that, because of the number of Standing Committees at present, most of which sit in both the mornings and afternoons, the <i>Official Report</i> of our proceedings may not be published as expeditiously as usual. I am bound to add that, when that warning has been given before, I have found that <i>Hansard</i> has performed in its usual efficient manner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to get the order of consideration motion absolutely right. I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 4, Schedule 1, Clauses 5 to 20, Schedule 2, Clauses 21 and 22, Schedule 3, Clause 23, Schedule 4, Clause 24, Schedule 5, Clauses 25 to 35, New Clauses, New Schedules, Clause 36, Schedules 6 and 7, Clause 37, Schedule 8, Clause 38, Schedule 9, Clauses 39 to 42.</p></blockquote>
It may be helpful if I explain briefly the purpose of the motion. In each case, it will be sensible for the Committee to consider the relevant schedule alongside the main clause to which it relates. It would be difficult to envisage a sensible discussion of, for example, clause 4, unless it were possible at the same time for members of the Committee to debate the provisions in schedule 1. I hope that the Committee agrees that this is a sensible way in which to proceed.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
ELECTION SCRUTINEER TO CHECK REGISTER</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 18, leave out 'suspects' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'provides reasonable grounds for suspecting'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 3, in page 2, leave out lines 20 and 21 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(b) that the scrutineer considers that the suspicion of the member or candidate is founded on reasonable grounds.'.</p></blockquote>
The amendments do not attack in any way the principle behind the clause. Clause 1 marries sections 24 and 49 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Section 24 deals with the register, its setting up and some of the statutory duties imposed on it. Section 49 deals with the scrutineer and pulls together the relationship and the statutory rights and duties involved in that relationship.<br><br>
We do not want to challenge that principle. That is not the purpose of the amendments. We think, however, that the balance in the clause is not correct. We aim to redress that imbalance by the amendments.<br><br>
All trade union legislation that has been developed over the past decade has imposed increasingly strict controls on trade unions. We fear that, as regards individuals, those controls and duties have not been properly balanced in the clause. Although it is right that individuals should have been given increased rights, they are not, at the same time, having duties imposed upon them.<br><br>
The new subsection (3A), with which our first amendment deals, states that the scrutineer must inspect the register if he is approached by a candidate or a trade union member who suspects that the register is not accurate and up-to-date. Our contention is that suspicion alone is too wide a context, given the increasing duties that have been placed on trade unions. That contention is enhanced by the fact that the person who raises the suspicion is shrouded in anonymity. I do not object to that; it is correct that a person should be able to raise a suspicion without fear of recrimination, doubt, blacklisting or intimidation. It is right that that person's anonymity should be protected in the Bill. However, the rights given to the individual mean that he must bear some of the responsibility. That is why we consider that suspicion alone is not a sufficient reason for the register to be inspected. Paragraph (b) of the new subsection (3A) states as a condition
<br><blockquote><p>"that the scrutineer does not consider that the suspicion of the member or candidate is ill-founded."</p></blockquote>
That is not enough. What is "ill-founded"? How easy is it to deal with? What does it mean? What is its balance and strength in law?<br><br>
The problem is highlighted and compounded by the fact that a member of a trade union already has recourse to action, if he considers that there is a problem with the register. Section 25(1) of the 1992 Act states that
<br><blockquote><p>"A member of a trade union who claims that the union has failed to comply with any of the requirements of section 24…may apply to the Certification Officer for a declaration to that effect."</p></blockquote>
Section 24(1) sets up the statutory duty for the register and ensures that its entries are accurate and kept up-to-date. The Bill correctly imposes further duties on a trade union, but too wide a right is given to an individual without imposing any duties upon him.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
I am not sure what "ill-founded" means in law, but I am not a lawyer. If a member of a trade union told the scrutineer that he thought that the record was wrong, the scrutineer could prove that the suspicion was ill-founded only if the member had claimed that the record was wrong because there were several members with two heads. Short of that, how can the scrutineer reject any complaint from any individual? If, an individual approaches the scrutineer and says, "I suspect that the register is incorrect", is the scrutineer obliged to examine the register or to ask the trade union to do so? How can the scrutineer reject a claim as ill-founded? I suggest to the Minister that, short of my ridiculous example, rejection is impossible.<br><br>
It would be far better to impose a duty on the scrutineer. Amendment No. 3 does that. It is an important principle of trade union legislation that the individual has rights. We accept that an individual is always at a disadvantage against big business, big battalions or big unions. Therefore, we should like the onus to be put on the scrutineer to consider that the suspicion of the member or candidate is founded on reasonable grounds. In that way, any raising of a vexatious or silly suspicion will not set in motion a big investigation, unnecessary procedures and huge cost. That is the substance of our amendments.<br><br>
The principle of the clause is correct, the principle behind having a register is correct and the principle of giving rights to individuals is correct, but certain duties must go with those rights. Therefore we want to ensure that there are at least reasonable grounds for that suspicion having been raised.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully understand the hon. Gentleman's concern about the problems that might arise if vexatious complaints were made. That could place an excessive burden on trade unions. I appreciate and welcome his support for the principle behind the clause. The debate offers a useful opportunity for me to reassure him that the clause already includes provision to avoid the difficulty about which he is concerned.<br><br>
It is the duty of the trade union to maintain an accurate and up-to-date register and the trade union will employ the scrutineer under the terms of the contract agreed between them. It is obviously important that the scrutineer can act freely in carrying out his duties. It is not necessary to oblige him to test the reasonableness of a request to inspect the union's register. As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said in his opening remarks, the clause provides that the scrutineer is under no duty to act on ill-founded requests. In addition, the first duty of the scrutineer is to inspect the register when it seems appropriate. Any other duty that he has to act on the requests of individuals or candidates is subject to that overriding condition.<br><br>
It is important to remember who the scrutineer is. He is an independent individual or organisation and he must meet stringent conditions laid down in regulations that are subject to parliamentary control. Clause 1 gives the scrutineer the discretion to examine the register when it seems appropriate to him to do so. The nature of his appointment requires him to be independent of the union. I assure the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden that the scrutineer will not follow up vexatious requests and the legislation need not specify the test that he will apply in following up requests.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. Clause 1 provides important new protection for the democratic rights of ordinary trade union members and I am encouraged to note from the tenor of the amendments tabled that Opposition and Government Members agree on the principle involved. For that reason, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment tabled by my hon. Friend is appropriate and would discourage vexatious requests. Clause 1, line 31 uses similar language to that used in the amendment. What is your objective in the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I remind the hon. Gentleman that when he uses the word 'you', it means me, not the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Olner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell the Committee why the word 'reasonably' is used in line 31 of clause 1?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can offer the Committee some guidance based on my experience of conducting ballots under existing legislation.<br><br>
It is important for the Minister to realise that the scrutineer must be seen by the Membership participating in the ballot to be totally fair and reasonable and a person in whom they can have absolute confidence. Such reasons justify the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. It is important that the scrutineer, when dealing with those who are participating in a ballot, is able to provide leadership and confidence in his role. If someone approaches the scrutineer and says vaguely, "I approach you because I have a suspicion", the scrutineer's task will be more difficult. Those participating in the ballot must have the utmost confidence in the scrutineer, as we had in the returning officers at the election which sent us to the House. There must be confidence in the system and I ask the Minister to consider that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hutton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say how much I am looking forward to serving on the Committee to discuss this important Bill? In a previous incarnation and before I became a Member of the House, I spent 11 years as an academic lawyer trying to make my students understand some of the gibberish that Conservative Members have passed into industrial relations law during the past 12 years.<br><br>
It may be said to be a reflection on my competence and ability—[Hon. Members: Hear, hear!"] Conservative Members would be wrong to make that assessment. I am not alone in my view of the gibberish that Conservative Members have supported for many years. That is also the view of Lord Denning, who is a very senior lawyer on the judicial bench. He described some of the legislation, especially the Employment Act 1980, as the most complicated and obscure that he as a judge had ever had the misfortune to try to interpret in the courts.<br><br>
There is a danger with some parts of the Bill that we shall put into law provisions that are incapable of satisfactory and sensible interpretation in the courts. My hon. Friends and I intend to introduce constructive amendments to improve the way in which the clause works and make its effect in practice and practical terms clear for all to see.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
I look forward to serving on the Committee. I want some aspects of the Bill to be improved and some clauses to be changed so that practitioners on both sides of industry—trade unions and employers—will be able to understand and adjust their behaviour accordingly.<br><br>
I lend my support to the amendment. One problem with paragraph (c) of clause 1 is that the words "suspects" and "up-to-date" may create problems. I have checked the interpretation clause and those words are not defined or clarified. I am particularly concerned about the concept of an up-to-date register and amendment No. 2 covers that. I am sure that the Minister is aware of some of the problems experienced by trade unions in maintaining an up-to-date register. Trade union members often change their addresses without notifying their trade unions. That is a difficulty which is covered by amendment No. 2 and we shall discuss that interesting point when we come to that amendment.<br><br>
The amendments are constructive and would help both sides of industry to reach a better understanding of the true impact of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I hear statements about changes in the attitude of industry, my concern is that people may believe that the only change has been the legislation enacted over the past 13 years. Changes in the attitudes of trade unions and the way in which they are run occurred largely because of the changes in the employment situation and the structure of industry and society during those years.<br><br>
Ballots, the scrutiny of ballots and the way that they are carried out are now embedded in the conduct of trade union business. The amendments would apply the test of reasonableness that is, surely, embodied in legislation in other areas. I cannot understand the logic behind the objection to the amendments, or the insistence upon not altering the Bill.<br><br>
One of our fears is not that the Government are trying to improve good practice but that they are being vindictive and want to impose unreasonable administrative processes. If the Conservatives want the Bill to stand the test of time and to be regarded as reasonable, the test of reasonableness should be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Minister will not accept this reasonable amendment. Most of us are familiar with ballots and the difficulty in a democracy of ensuring that they are properly scrutinised. I have seen democratic voting delayed by people constantly checking and rechecking ballot members. A person should have reasonable grounds for asking a scrutineer to check whether a ballot member is bona fide. If the scrutineer had to spend his time checking thousands of names, the vote would never take place. Whoever objects must have reasonable grounds, and the scrutineer must have the right to decide whether those grounds are reasonable. If they are not, the ballot ought to continue.<br><br>
The Minister should seriously consider the amendment, or democracy will go out the window. There is always a strange character who, for many reasons, does not want votes to be registered and who does everything in his power to prevent democratic ballots taking place.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hanson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome you, Mr. Knox, to the Chair. We share office facilities and I have seen you at the photocopier on several occasions. It is a pleasure to see you in Committee.<br><br>
The word "suspects" is interesting. It can mean many things. In trade unions such as the Transport and General Workers Union, which has 1.5 million members, or my union, Manufacturing, Science and Finance, which has about 800,000 members, it is easy for one or two members to suspect that something is not right. The register might be out of date. But "suspects" and having reasonable grounds for suspicion are two distinct and separate concepts.<br><br>
The amendment is not a wrecking amendment, or one that attacks the principle of the clause. It would strenthen the Bill and help to achieve smooth, fair and just elections by ensuring that one or two members out of a million or more will not be able to destroy an election by continually interrupting the work of the scrutineer.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would explain how the scrutineer's powers could wreck an election. The scrutineer has no power to interfere in the electoral process. He merely reports after the event on any complaints.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The scrutineer's powers could lead to delay and cause unnecessary expense to trade unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where in the Bill are delaying powers given to the scrutineer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am worried that the scrutineer's activities will cause additional expense for trade unions and concern about the way in which elections are conducted. Amendment No. 1 would require a member to have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the register was not accurate. In a union of a million or more members, one or two might try to cause problems for the scrutineer by making requests that would be legitimate if the clause were to include the word 'suspects'. However, we ought to require them to have reasonable grounds for their suspicion. We do not want members to be able to wreck or delay, so they should provide reasonable grounds before the scrutineer carries out his role.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, welcome the opportunity to serve on the Committee. As a lawyer who has wrestled with these problems for about 15 years, I recognise the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton). However, I have wrestled at least as often with dreadful laws passed by Labour Governments with those passed by the Conservatives which have, for the most part, been slightly better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was talking not about the purpose of the laws with which we have been grappling, but about the accuracy of the drafting of those laws. The hon. Gentleman may disagree with the purpose of some of the laws passed by Labour Governments but I am sure that he would at least concede that most of them were well drafted and precise. Many of the employment laws passed by this Government have been obscure and have confused practice on both sides of industry.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The reason for the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, was that the first effort was not much good.<br><br>
If the concept of reasonableness is included, the discretion of the scutineer will be reduced. The current wording of paragraph (6) of new subsecton (3A), the test for the scrutineer, is purely subjective. If he considers that the suspicion is not well-founded, that is the end of the matter. To include the concept of reasonableness is to invite litigation. Some disgruntled trade unionists or candidates could argue that they have reasonable grounds and seek a court judgment. I suggest that the Opposition's proposal would have the opposite effect to that which they intend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I forgot to congratulate the Minister, who has just been awarded the title, "Parliamentarian to watch." That comes as no surprise to the Opposition; we have been watching him for years. But, perhaps he would clear up the confusion about his children's opinion as to whether the award is "crawler of the year" or "creep of the year." Whatever criticisms hon. Members may have of the Minister—and they are many indeed—calling him a creep or a crawler is unjustified, although it may be appropriate to call him a creepy crawler.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He has been working on that all along.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it was just off the cuff.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, but I am still not satisfied. It comes down to the definition of the basis on which something is ill founded. If someone raises a suspicion with the scrutineer, on what basis is it not ill founded? Can the Minister give me an example, other than the one of a vote with two heads on the register, which is manifestly ill founded? The point I am trying to make is that, should someone raise a suspicion, there is no reason for the scrutineer to reject it. If the Minister can convince me otherwise, I might be tempted to change my mind about the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden for his remarks. It is clear that he and my children share the same reverence towards me. I do not hold him in quite the same affection, but I have spent many happy hours on such Committees and I shall try hard to reassure him about the issues that he raised.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald) put his finger on it when he said that the duty is on the scrutineer to consider complaints but the discretion rests with the scrutineer. Without wanting to bore the Committee by repeating my arguments, I stress that the scrutineer is not any Tom, Dick or Harry or—if that is a sexist expression—Tracey, but someone who, to be appointed, has to meet strict criteria laid down by regulation. The scrutineer must use his or her discretion. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said that he could not think of a circumstance in which the scrutineer could refuse a request. The scrutineer can refuse a request if he or she believes it to be improper.<br><br>
Given that the complainant does not have access to the register, it is difficult to understand how that person would be able to demonstrate the strength of his or her case. In defence of the Government, our original proposal was for hon. Members to have access to the register of names. We responded to the representations about confidentiality, which came from Opposition Members and the trade

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
unions, by substituting the gatekeeper of the scrutineer. It is important that there is an opportunity for complaints to be investigated properly.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) said that the scrutineer must inspire confidence in his or her role and that the task was made too difficult by the provision's vagueness. It is precisely because the scrutineer has discretion and authority that he or she can inspire confidence and that he or she has all the tests needed to weed out vexatious complaints, be they ill-founded or appropriate.<br><br>
The reference by the hon. Member for Nuneaton to line 31 of the Bill left me puzzled. I was particularly puzzled by his reference to "reasonably practical". The 1992 Act embodies much of the reforming legislation that has been introduced. To hon. Members such as the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness, who criticise our legislation in this area, I say that we now enjoy the lowest number of strikes and the lowest number of days being lost in our industries. That legislation has been effective and, to a large extent, has been responsible for the record levels of inward investment which have been attracted to Britain as a base within the Community.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Nuneaton might like to look at section 24(1) of the 1992 Act, which provides the duty to maintain a register of members' names and addresses. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"A trade union shall compile and maintain a register of the names and addresses of its members, and shall secure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that the entries in the register are accurate and are kept up-to-date."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, the phrase "reasonably practicable" which the hon. Gentleman wanted in relation to the accuracy of the register already exists.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham) shared the confusion of other Opposition Members when he said that the scrutineer might hold up the ballot while he was checking the register. It is important to be clear: the scrutineer is under a duty to report after—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat confused by that comment. I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify whether he is saying that, in the event of an adverse report from the scrutineer, he would not expect the trade union to act on that report when conducting the election?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any member of the Committee would expect a trade union not to act if an abuse had been exposed. I am explaining the scrutineer's duties, which will not, in themselves, result in any delay to an election. It is for the trade union to decide whether to delay as a result of the scrutineer's inquiries. The scrutineer's duty is to report on the election after it has been conducted. The union can declare the result of the election only after it receives the scrutineer's report. That provision is already established in law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Spellar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment tries to deal with the danger of the tail-chasing exercise whereby many hares must be chased, and to establish where the balance lies in the scrutineer's duties. If the scrutineer is chasing several erroneous arguments, that could create delays.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Section 49(3)(c) of the 1992 Act states that the scrutineer must
<br><blockquote><p>"make his report to the trade union as soon as reasonably practicable after the last date for the return of voting papers".</p></blockquote>
If the Scrutineer is having to chase several claims, some of which are probably invalid, he will be held up. The trade union is consequently held up because it is unable to announce the result until it has received the scrutineer's report. Delays could occur if the scrutineer is under a duty to chase borderline cases which may not be valid or reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman deals with a different issue from that of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden), who argued that the ballot would be delayed. The hon. Member for Warley, West (Mr. Spellar) argues that if the scrutineer's report was delayed, the announcement of the result could be delayed. Those are separate matters.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Warley, West is correct, but I am sorry that Opposition Members have so little faith in the trade unions to carry out their existing duty under the law to maintain an up-to-date and accurate register of members. We have read in the newspapers about the Union of Construction Allied Trades and Technicians and other unions which have ghost members, but I assumed that the change in the law had swept that away.<br><br>
Hon. Members' belief that examining the membership list and establishing whether there are problems will prove such an arduous task for the scrutineer is a great slur on the trade union movement which I did not expect from Opposition Members. I accept that Opposition Members have more experience of trade unions than I—<i>[Interruption]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Too many remarks from a sedentary position on the Front Benches are setting a bad example to other members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. McLoughlin) has considerable experience with trade unions.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that a scrutineer may delay an announcement? For example, if before a ballot, the validity of 1,000 members to vote was questioned—perhaps because they had not paid their union dues—and the scrutineer had to go through an exhaustive process to discover whether that was so, would that delay the ballot? If a ballot had taken place and it was alleged that 1,000 members had not paid their dues and were therefore not eligible to vote, would you agree, Minister—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has been in the House for some time. "You" means me and I am not a Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that and I apologise, Mr. Knox.<br><br>
Surely the Minister understands my point. Before a ballot takes place, a scrutineer may say that it will not be valid if non-members vote or, after a ballot, he may say that the decision is not valid because non-members voted. The scrutineer will have a strong role if he can set up an investigation when there is reasonable doubt.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is a very long intervention. Interventions should be short and to the point. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to make a speech, as he seems to be doing, he must catch my eye later. Will he please bring his intervention to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that this is a very important intervention—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It does not matter whether the intervention is important. An intervention is not a means of making a point. The hon. Gentleman must do that in a speech. An intervention must be very short and to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your guidance, Mr. Knox. I shall conclude my intervention as I am sure that the Minister is aware of what I am trying to say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the gist of what the hon. Gentleman said.<br><br>
I started this debate by welcoming the fact that all members of the Committe seemed to be committed to the principle of the clause. As I listened to the hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde and his hon. Friends, I began to have doubts. The reason for giving the scrutineer additional powers is to establish that elections are properly conducted. The hon. Gentleman seems to be saying that it is unreasonable for delays to occur in the announcement of the ballot when complaints must be investigated to ensure that every member of the union will be confident that the ballot was properly conducted. If he is saying that, we are becoming divided on a matter of principle rather than of practicality.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde appeared to acknowledge the point which I made to the hon. Member for Warley, West that the scrutineer does not have the power to delay the passage of the election. It is for the union to decide, following a complaint or an investigation by the scrutineer, whether an election should be abandoned, perhaps because there were five Donald Ducks and six Mickey Mouses on the register. That would be a decision for the union, but the union would not be able to announce the result until the scrutineer's report had been published. The purpose of that is to provide confidence.<br><br>
The Scrutineer's report might show that there had been complaints, that they had been investigated and that the results of the investigation would be included in the report. It would be for the union to decide what action to take and whether to seek redress through the courts or the certification officer.<br><br>
The provision simply provides the scrutineer, whose appointment is covered by previous legislation, with the duty to follow up complaints in a reasonable manner, subject to his own judgment. It is difficult to understand how the hon. Gentleman can object to that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Joyce Quin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not argue against the principle and my hon. Friends have not done so. Will the Minister tell us whether he has had discussions with the unions on the cost implications? The cost to a union averages £1,000 for the scrutineer's time, so the cost implications should be considered, even if the principle is not discarded.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Lady that we should not put unreasonable cost burdens on trade unions. The hon. Lady quoted a figure for the cost of a scrutineer, but I cannot confirm it.<br><br>
We have had considerable consultation on the issue of how to prevent the sort of abuse that took place in the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians and elsewhere when registers were not maintained accurately and did not enable properly conducted, democratic ballots to be carried out. If the hon. Lady agrees with the principle, I am not sure what she means when she complains about the cost of appointing scrutineers. Scrutineers will be appointed anyway. There has been consultation with the trade unions and others on the best way of maintaining an accurate register. Our original proposal was to give individual members a right of access to the register, but the unions objected, as did others, on the grounds of confidentiality. The proposal in the Bill is for the scrutineer to act as gatekeeper and to use his judgment, unfettered by any test of reasonableness which Opposition Members wish to put in the Bill, to decide whether to look at the register or follow up specific complaints. That is reasonable and consistent with ensuring fair and democratic elections without creating unnecessary burdens for trade unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When replying to the previous two interventions, the Minister said unreasonable once and reasonable twice. That is the test that we want in the provision. When the rhetoric and distortions have been removed from his answer, the difference between us seems to concern the application of the test of reasonableness and the word "ill-founded".<br><br>
If the Minister's intention, as he has repeatedly said, is that the scrutineer should behave reasonably, why should not the test of reasonableness apply before subjecting trade unions to the delays and costs that we have discussed? The relevant point is not the airy-fairy stuff about our intentions; it is whether the test or reasonableness should apply. You have used the word "reasonable" three times in the past three minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have not used the word reasonable at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You are always reasonable, Mr Knox. The trouble with words such as "reasonable" is that what the hon. Gentleman and I may consider reasonable may be different. The hon. Gentleman probably believes that the Bill is not reasonable, whereas my view is that it is. Opposition Members must recognise that the scrutineer, who is employed by the union but will have duties placed upon him, will be able to exercise his discretion to make a decision on complaints to him. Nothing in the Bill fetters his discretion.<br><br>
It is not unreasonable to suppose that a lawyer or body which meets the terms of the regulations for the appointment of a scrutineer would act reasonably. What the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East seeks is already provided in the Bill. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North said, the amendment for which the hon. Gentleman is arguing would add to the difficulty which he has highlighted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I heard the Minister correctly, he said that he did not want to impose further costs on trade unions and he mentioned the conduct of the ballots. Will the extra cost that the unions might incur by employing the services of

election scrutineers be met by the rules covering the reimbursement of the cost of runing postal ballots in the Employment Act 1980? Would the cost be reimbursed to the trade unions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention although it is not strictly relevant. The answer to his question is no, trade unions would not be reimbursed. That issue should be discussed at a later stage of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's assurance that we shall return to that issue later. The answer that he gave about the reimbursement of cost makes it vital that the amendment is accepted. If it is not, however unreasonable a scrutineer's view might be about whether a complaint is well-founded, unlimited costs could accrue to the trade union because a test of reasonableness would not have been applied. Pending the debate on cost, it is not asking too much for reasonableness to be applied to the Government's view on how the independent scrutineers should behave.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot be communicating effectively with the hon. Gentleman. He wants to add a qualification to the scrutineer's ability to act which would be a test for reasonableness. He has argued that costs would be imposed on the union if the scrutineer, as a result of a request, inspected the register. He is assuming that the scrutineer would not consider such requests in a reasonable manner. I cannot for the life of me think how a scrutineer could decide whether a request was unreasonable without inspecting the register. What tests would he apply to decide that? It is absurd for the hon. Gentleman to argue that a qualification of reasonableness governing the actions of the scrutineer would save him having to look at the register. Far be it from me to help Opposition Members—although I am happy to do so—to reduce the burdens on the trade union movement. But I ask them to bear in mind the words of wisdom of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North. The amendment would have the opposite effect of that intended. What the Opposition want is provided for in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I dispose of the red herring which Ministers always introduce? My hon. Friends were not suggesting that it was wrong to delay an election until complaints and suspicions about the register had been validated. Their concern was that it would be wrong to delay a ballot and incur costs if the complaints and suspicions were purely vexatious. The Bill would allow vexatious suspicions to be raised without providing a means of screening them.<br><br>
I accept that the scrutineer's decision would be subjective and that is an important principle. I asked the Minister if he could tell me on what basis, apart from my example of a member with two heads, a suspicion would be rejected on the grounds that it was ill-founded. The Minister did not answer that. If a member tells the scrutineer that he suspects that the register is wrong, the scrutineer must investigate. There is no basis for him to reject that suspicion. That is the problem that we face in such circumstances.<br><br>
Amendment No. 1 puts the onus on the Member who raises the complaint, while amendment No. 3 puts the onus on the scrutineer. I would prefer the onus to be on the scrutineer. I accept that, as much as possible, we should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
ensure the rights of each Member and individual. I notice that the Chairmen are having a consultation and I shall pursue my point until Mr. Hogg takes the Chair.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman wants an example, let me think of an uncontroversial one. If a similar complaint had already been made and the scrutineer had already investigated it, it might not be sensible for him to proceed with investigating a further complaint.</span></p>
<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that example, although it is not enough to satisfy me. We are concerned that there is too much scope for vexatious complaints. Amendment No. 1 places the onus on the individual whereas amendment no. 3 places the onus on the scrutineer. We would like to ensure that the onus is always on the scrutineer. Therefore, we shall not press amendment No. 1 to a Division, but we shall press amendment No. 3 to a Division when it comes up in the order of business. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 19, leave out', accurate and up-to-date', and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'as accurate as could reasonably be expected,'</p></blockquote>
I welcome, you, Mr. Hogg, to the Chair. We know that you always temper your judgments with quotations from the Bible and theological matters. We shall look forward to these quotations. Readers of the <i>Sunday Times</i> in Scotland will appreciate what an expert you are on such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I believe that, in another context, the hon. Gentleman's remarks would be appropriate. However, there is no reference to the scriptures or to the <i>Sunday Times</i> in amendment No. 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As you know, Mr. Hogg, I am as well-informed of the scriptures as you are, and I can introduce them into or make them relevant to any amendment if that is what you want.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Heaven forbid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 2 continues the theme of the previous amendments. We do not aim to attack the principle involved in the clause but to prove the basis and legal nature of the clause to prevent any queries or vexatious litigation in the future.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister could give us a definition of "accurate and up to date". All of us—not just trade unionists—who have experience of such matters know that there is always someone who wants to nitpick and complain. Does "accurate and up to date" mean that, if one member were not included on a register of 1.5 million that register was not "accurate and up to date". Is two, five or 100 inaccurate? What is the basis?<br><br>
Section 24(1) of the 1992 Act uses the words "reasonably practical". Why cannot the clause make it absolutely clear that it is a test of reasonableness so that the scrutineer will not be open to litigatious, vexatious individuals who wish to query minor discrepancies in the register?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you, Mr. Hogg, to our proceedings and say how much I look forward to your chairmanship of these deliberations. The hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0356">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
Strathkelvin and Bearsden, you and I have spent many long hours in the Committee, some productive, some less productive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mostly productive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that these hours will be productive. As the hon. Gentleman has just said, the time that we have spent with each other has been mostly productive.<br><br>
The amendment would limit the circumstances in which the scrutineer could be asked by a trade union member or a candidate to inspect the membership register to those in which an individual suspected that the membership register was not as accurate as could reasonably be expected.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden referred to the legal requirement, set out in section 24 of the 1992 Act, that entries in a union's membership register should be both accurate and kept up to date. The amendment moves away from that, which surprises me. Surely both requirements are necessary. The provisions of the clause are designed to protect the democratic rights of trade union members by ensuring that elections for the posts covered by chapter IV of part I of the 1992 Act are based on a register which is both accurate and up to date. No one would argue that an individual's democratic rights are effectively maintained if an election is based on an electoral register which was accurate six months ago but which has not been updated since. Surely it is not too much to expect that a union's register should be accurate and up to date when an individual's right to vote depends on that. A lesser standard would represent a disservice to candidates and union members.<br><br>
I thought that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden might be concerned that the clause demands higher standards of union registers than does section 24 of the 1992 Act, which places unions under an obligation to secure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the entries in the register are accurate and kept up to date. Perhaps I can reassure the hon. Gentleman. The two provisions are separate. New subsection (3A)(a) gives the scrutineer a particular duty to inspect or examine the register if a member or candidate suspects—generally, a subjective matter—that the register is not accurate and up to date. I hope that it is clear to the Committee that that is always subject to the scrutineer's judgement of whether it is appropriate to act on those suspicions.<br><br>
If the scrutineer examines the register on the basis of a complaint, he records that fact in his report on the election. He will state whether his investigations have revealed any matters which should be drawn to the trade union's attention to assist in maintaining its register. The scrutineer knows the legal obligations on the trade unions; to become a scrutineer, he has to comply with the requirements which are set out in subordinate legislation. The scrutineer will not carry out an investigation on the basis of unreasonable or impracticable expectations of a union membership register.<br><br>
Much of the ground relating to the amendment as covered in the previous debate. I understand the concern of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and I hope that, on the basis of my explanation, he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, to, take the opportunity to welcome you, Mr. Hogg, to the Chair.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
I am grateful for the Minister's assurance, but the unamended clause still worries me considerably. Not amending the clause would lead to conflict and contradiction between the provisions of the 1992 Act and the Bill. The amendment's proposals are reasonable. The Committee's response to them will, to some extent, determine whether the clause is motivated by a desire to ensure that union registers are up to date and accurate, or whether it is designed to catch out trade unions, even if, they have done all that can reasonably be expected of them.<br><br>
It is important that we recognise how membership registers are kept up-to-date and accurate. The majority of unions keep their records centrally, but keeping records up-to-date is usually the responsibility of an army of unpaid people, whether they be local stewards or branch officers.<br><br>
Often, even if a union puts every effort into ensuring that its records are accurate, they will not be completely up-to-date. It is possible for a union member to die, or leave employment and for that information not to filter through for some time. It is even more likely that the information will not filter through quickly if the provisions of the Bill on check-off go through because it will hold up the process of transmitting information to the union's central records. In addition, the provision to allow a person to join more then one union will delay the process. Therefore, a union's records may not be up-to-date, even though the union has reasonable grounds for believing that they are. That is a problem for trade unions, which are mainly staffed by voluntary helpers. It is also a problem for the Government. It is only a week since the debate over league tables in education. We discovered that the tables were neither up-to-date nor accurate. I understand that when the Secretary of State for Education gave evidence to the Select Committee, he said that his Department would get it right next year. That is fine, but why is it reasonable to expect trade unions to have higher standards in keeping their membership records up to date than the Government, with all the resources at their disposal, in keeping then-education league tables up-to-date?<br><br>
If a scrutineer reports that a membership record is not entirely accurate but that the union has done everything that it was reasonably practicable to do, the whole process will be undermined. People will not know what view to take of such a report. It would be better if both measures said that the union must do all that is reasonably practicable to ensure that its records are accurate and if the same formula were to apply to the role of the scrutineer. The amendment is not unreasonable and I hope that the Government will accept it. That would show whether the Government's purpose is to ensure that membership records are accurate or whether the Bill is designed to create more bureaucracy and greater delays and to punish organisations that rely on unpaid help to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply was helpful. As I understand it, he said that if, for the purposes of subsection (3A), the scrutineer is satisfied that the union has fulfilled its statutory obligation under section 24 of the 1992 Act, and that it has taken every reasonable and practical step to ensure that the register is accurate, that will be sufficient. In other words, the two are separate. Is that correct? <i>[Interruption.]</i> Someone from afar has said, yes.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I would try to explain when the hon. Gentleman had sat down.

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span> I beg to move amendment No. 5, in page 2, line 28, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(cc) after subsection (4) there shall be added:</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) The scrutineer shall not transmit to any person the whole or part of any information provided by the trade union, its officials or members in respect to the election, whether in the register of members, voting papers or otherwise".'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 7, in page 3, line 13, after 'request', insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(cc) whether he was appointed by any employer or other person or body other than the trade union for information falling within section 49(4A) above, and what action he took in regard to the matter,'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are substantial amendments. Many of my hon. Friends will want to contribute to the debate and relate their personal trade union experiences.<br><br>
There are several reasons why we want to maintain the confidentiality of records. We are not suggesting that the scrutineers will hand them out to anyone who requires
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
them, but we do think it important, for the scrutineers' benefit and protection, that there should be a statutory obligation to maintain confidentiality of the register. Unions go to great lengths to compile the register and so maintain confidentiality. If the register were out of their hands, they would want that confidentiality maintained.<br><br>
The most important reason to maintain confidentiality is that of security. As hon. Members will appreciate, it is essential for the names on the Members' register of the Prison Officers Association of Northern Ireland to be confidential. The amendment would ensure that that confidentiality would be maintained. Another reason for maintaining confidentiality is that the names and addresses of many women are on the registers and they may want that information to be confidential from their spouses or their partners. They would not want the information to get into anyone else's hands.<br><br>
The unions themselves have reasons for maintaining confidentiality. A branch might want the complete register in order to organise shenanigans. I experienced a problem involving the General Medical Council's list of registered doctors which was going to be handed out to junk mail companies, private medical companies and purveyors of those throwaway magazines which come through the door as often as Members of Parliament get junk mail. However, that reason is at the bottom of the list of reasons for maintaining confidentiality.<br><br>
Finally, some of my colleagues in the House have suffered from being on the list of the Economic League which has led to blacklisting, blackmailing, victimisation and discrimination in the labour market. Many have suffered from being on that list, including my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). It was to my great displeasure that I was not on the Economic League's list.<br><br>
All the lists that are produced can do one's street cred no end of good. I remember when the right hon. Member for Tweedale, Ettrick and Lauderdale (Sir D. Steel) produced his list naming 87 of the hard men in British politics. To my great pleasure, I was on that list which did my street cred in Bearsden a great deal of good—the leafy suburbs were lining up to cheer me. The point that I am trying to make is that if the register were to get into the wrong hands—for whatever reason—there would be a problem for all of us. We therefore want to ensure that the register would remain confidential.<br><br>
The problem of maintaining confidentiality may be covered by the Data Protection Act 1984. If the register were on computer, would it be covered by the provisions of that Act it Would the register not be handed over other than for a purpose permitted by the individual? That is my understanding of the law, but I am not sure how strong and how useful the law is on such matters. I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify that.<br><br>
Even if the Data Protection Act 1984 protected information on computer disks, there would still be a case for the amendment. Not all registers may be on computer-some may be compiled manually, some may be part-manual, part-computer. New members might be registered manually and would not be on the computer. A classic example would be of a new union starting up which, for several months, may have its members on a manual register only. For about four months the Oil Industry Liaison Committee had a manual register. During that time, had that Committee wanted to hold ballots, it would not have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
been covered by the Data Protection Act 1984. That is an example of when the Data Protection Act does not work, however effective it may be for computerised records.<br><br>
Such counter-arguments might have been dealt with, but another reason for the amendment is that we feel that it is important to protect the scrutineer so that he cannot come under pressure from any individual in his company. His company may be a legal firm that also undertakes work for employers, and he might be pressurised to release that information to the other members employed in the company. We want a statutory duty placed on the scrutineer to give him or her protection to prevent that from happening.<br><br>
We think that it is correct and proper that when the scrutineer completes his detailed report, is should include information as to whether he was approached by any individuals who wanted the list. That is the purpose of amendment No. 7. Such an inclusion is important for democracy and openness and it would act as a barrier to people approaching the scrutineer in such a way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend covered several of the points that I intend to make. I want to illustrate the validity of the issues that he raised.<br><br>
From my experience of working in a trade union which, in part, covered members in Northern Ireland, I think that there are sound reasons why the amendment should be approved. It is crucial that, in circumstances such as those that face the trade union movement in Northern Ireland, members feel able to express their rights or wishes to become a member of a trade union and, in some cases, to do so in privacy.<br><br>
I am sure that all hon. Members share my concern about how a certain newspaper this morning managed to lead with a story about the private affairs of a right hon. Member, whose competence as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be one thing, but whose private financial affairs are another. Information could fall into the hands of people wishing to be unscrupulous and should not be made available to <i>The Sun.</i> The hon. Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste) said on the Floor of the House that people join trade unions for all sorts of reasons and not necessarily for reasons directly connected with collective bargaining. They may join for broader reasons, such as insurance, because a certain union may have a good record for dealing with potential unfair dismissal cases. Nevertheless those people may want to exercise their constitutional rights under union rules to participate in ballots affecting the leadership of that union. There should be no risk whatever of a person's name and address reaching the public domain.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, we await the Minister's response. The matter is covered in part by the Data Protection Act 1984, but the date on which the definition of membership is implemented may not be the same as that on which a button is pressed to make an electronic record of membership. Manual registers will often supplement electronic registers.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
Even if, as I suspect, the matter is covered by the Data Protection Act, the danger will still exist because of manual records. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that every "t" is crossed and every "i" is dotted to guarantee the protection to which people are entitled when participating in ballots.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is one of the most important amendments that we have tabled and I hope that the Minister will satisfy us on the main issue.<br><br>
I am concerned about blacklisting and intimidation, which occurs in many circumstances and at many levels from the most serious to the informal, which nevertheless, is important to those concerned. The Government would do themselves a favour if they included in the Bill a provision covering the systematic blacklisting of active trade unionists which still occurs. Nothing has been done about organisations such as the Economic League, which for many years has blacklisted people to the detriment of their employment opportunities and which continues to do so with effective immunity despite the Data Protection Act. I know of people in the Coventry area who have been deprived of employment for many years because they are on such blacklists. Those blacklists operate informally in some areas. People may know that they are not on a formal blacklist because the list is leaked from time to time, but because of past activities within the trade union movement, they may have been debarred from working in specific areas and have been obliged to leave those areas or to leave the trade at which they are skilled to obtain employment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred to the matter. People join trade unions for various reasons. Some feel that as their careers develop the organisation for which they work does not consider it appropriate that they remain a member of a trade union, so they give up their membership because of that informal pressure. They may later become involved in a legal difficulty and be unable to sue because they have given up their trade union membership and do not have the legal support that unions can provide.<br><br>
I have always worked in well-organised shops and industries where there were no systematic attempts to root out trade union members, as occurs in smaller organisations. Some small managements are notorious for their behaviour, which ranges from rooting out trade union members to ensure that they are at the top of redunancy lists and making certain job allocations to encourage them to leave, to blatant victimisation and removal of individuals from the company to prevent trade union activities.<br><br>
The Bill rightly incorporates protection for people who raise objections about events in their union and provides that such people are entitled to anonymity. That is correct. If it were not included in the legislation, I am sure that abuses would occur and that people who object to practices in their union would face certain pressures. The Government should balance the Bill to ensure that there is no such intimidation. The Data Protection Act 1984 does not provide the full panoply of protection that is required. But the amendment would ensure that trade union members can preserve their anonymity, so that they do not suffer the sorts of intimidation that I have mentioned, which I know take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I concur with the remarks of Opposition Members as they relate to Northern Ireland. In Northern Ireland, we have enjoyed excellent trade union relationships in industry for the past 20 years. In fact, because of excellent relationships in the workplace, our problems have not been as serious as the media would have people believe.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
As a paid-up member of the Ulster Farmers Union and a former member of the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers, I welcome those aspects of the legislation which will ensure more democracy in the movement. However, the Government should balance the Bill to ensure the protection of individuals as outlined in amendment No. 5. Individuals in Northern Ireland have reasonable grounds to fear that their names and addresses may get into the wrong hands for, some might suggest, the purposes of intimidation or pure sectarianism. I urge the Government to consider recent developments in Europe and the difficulties that may arise in Great Britain, where racism raises its ugly head from time to time. I know that all hon. Members will want to prevent that. So I urge the Government to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Hogg. I look forward to spending many hours with you.<br><br>
I welcome the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. As has already been mentioned, it will protect the scrutineer and the individual. I should like to offer some concrete examples of how it may operate. I welcome the views of Government Members about the rights of the individual. The Conservative party speaks in voluminous tones about the rights of the individual and the Government have said today that they wish the rights of the individual to be protected. The amendment does just that, so I should be surprised if the Government do not accept it.<br><br>
The Data Protection Act 1984 has been mentioned. I should like the Minister to clarify whether he believes that the Data Protection Act covers the aim of the amendment. If it will and the Minister can give cast-iron assurances, I am sure that my hon. Friends will rest more easily in their beds this evening.<br><br>
We are concerned that the aims, will not be met by the Data Protection Act alone. Contrary to popular belief, as we in the Labour party know, trade unions are not necessarily high-tech businesses. Often, they run manual systems—certainly at local level—which would not be covered by the Data Protection Act.<br><br>
I am concerned for the rights of the individual because, by joining a trade union, members have made a contract. Union members have not made a contract with the scrutineer or with any third party who might, in due course, receive the information—the scrutineer has released the information, deliberately or by accident, to a third party.<br><br>
If I join a trade union, I join a trade union and the contract is my concern. Nobody forces, me to join the trade union. I join because I want to—perhaps I want to keep the privacy between me and the trade union in the event of my needing its services. I may play no active role and may not wish to take part in any other activity on behalf of the union. The right of the individual to privacy is important. If Conservative Members believe in the rights of the individual, surely one of the greatest rights that an individual can have is that of privacy.<br><br>
If the amendment is not accepted, I assume that Conservative Members would consider allowing the names of members of politcal parties to be issued via a third party to an agency.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Trade union members have a role and responsibility which they may wish to keep private for a range of reasons. I urge Conservative Members to accept that and to consider their fundamental beliefs about the rights of individuals and about privacy when they are deciding how to vote on the amendment.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has mentioned several instances which are of particular concern to Opposition Members: first, those who join trade unions in a non-trade union employment environment. I class myself in that category. Whichever I have worked since 1981, trade unions have not been recognised or encouraged, but I remained a member of a trade union because of my personal political beliefs and because I might, in the future, have needed the services that collective responsibility brings. In the event of action being taken against me in employment, for whatever reason, I might have needed the support and encouragement of the union, even though it was not recognised.<br><br>
I was happy to tell everyone that I was a member of the Manufacturing Science Finance union, although the environment was not trade union recognised. There are many people who, for personal, political, social or economic reasons, want to be members of a union in a non-unionised or actively anti-union environment.<br><br>
If a company or an organisation wants to be anti-union, it is a matter of the freedom of the individual to decide on that, as company policy. Equally, it is an issue of individual freedom to join a trade union and to have the privacy to keep that membership secret from a third party.<br><br>
The amendment is concerned that the scrutineer shall not transmit a name to a third party by accident or on purpose. The amendment is needed, for that reason alone.<br><br>
Many of my constituents come to surgeries to discuss employment issues on behalf of someone else—for example, a wife who did not want to come to the surgery herself in case someone from work saw her. If such a level of fear exists in the community, the amendment is needed to strengthen the Bill so that the scrutineer is allowed not to transmit to anyone information either in whole or in part. That could be done by accident, or deliberately. We are not casting doubts on the scrutineer, but aiming to provide that protection for the individual, particularly someone in a non-union environment.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
Let me give a further example, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend from Strathkelvin and Bearsden. It relates to women members. I have an on-going constituency case which involves a woman who was pursued from one end of Wales to the other by her common law husband who, for the previous eight years had committed domestic violence against her. He has tracked down the woman to my constituency because she belongs to a voluntary organisation, whose name he has now obtained. He is now causing difficulties for my constituent in her home. My constituent had an enforcement order upheld by the courts. There is an injunction to prevent the third party from entering the family home.<br><br>
I do not mean that either by accident or by deliberate procedure a scrutineer would give the name of a trade union member on the list to a third party. The amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
would, I hope, strengthen the clause and make it a requirement that the scrutineer should take account of these matters in such circumstances and that he would
<br><blockquote><p>"not transmit to any person the whole or part of any information provided by the trade union, its officials or members in respect to the election, whether in the register of members, voting papers or otherwise".</p></blockquote>
We do not live in an ideal world. Trade union membership—offering a list, an address and a contact point—can be a way for one person in, perhaps, 10 million to find somebody and track him down. That is worrying. That is why I hope that if the Minister cannot accept the amendment he will at least address the issue of providing protection. People may want the Committee to provide protection from individuals with malicious intentions who, by accident or design, could be provided with the name or the whereabouts of someone who, for genuine reasons, wants to retain his or her anonymity.<br><br>
Junk mail was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. Without the amendment, it would be possible for the scrutineer, either deliberately, for personal gain, or by accident, to sell the list of members to a third party, particularly if that list is composed manually and, therefore, not covered by the Data Protection Act 1984. Can the Minister tell us whether that could happen? Our amendment would ensure that the scrutineer could not divulge that information.<br><br>
I feel strongly that the amendment will find resonance with Conservative members of the Committee, because of its implications for the freedom of the individual. I hope that it will be approved and that that freedom—the freedom to privacy, the freedom to ensure that one's activities are private and the freedom to belong without reference to anyone else—will be assured. The absence of that provision could lead to circumstances that would be unhelpful to individuals in their political and economic activities and in their personal fives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning <span class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: when the Minister replies, I should be grateful if he could assure both sides of the Committee about confidentiality. The point has been raised about Northern Ireland and the way in which access to personal information, such as names, addresses and telephone numbers, can adversely affect women in particular. Can the Minister reassure me? If a woman registers with British Telecom as a user of a telephone and she is a single householder, she is advised not to list her full name in the directory or to be ex-directory. There is growing awareness of the way in which information can be used by people who wish women—whom they might not know—harm. Unfortunately, there are people in society who, once they have access to information, will use it for adverse purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support this important amendment. If the Minister were not to accept it, the Bill would be fatally flawed because it would not protect the rights of trade union members.<br><br>
I am sponsored by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers. Many shop workers are employed in small shops where there are only two or three union members. If a scrutineer released the union's register, a shop with 10 employees, of whom only one was a union member, could put that person under pressure because of her union's policy on Sunday working. It is essential that people's rights are protected—their right to be a member of a trade
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
union and their right to anonymity. Scrutineers would have to ensure—and the Minister must ensure—that a trade union's register of members would not be given out willy-nilly. That would be dangerous.<br><br>
It is a civil liberties issue. It is about the right not to be subjected to pressure. In Scotland, blacklists are held by companies, associations and organisations that try their best to get hold of trade union membership lists. Membership lists which have been given to companies have ensured that particular people on them are not employed. The Government must ensure that there is complete protection for people in unions so that they do not fear recriminations. No one should be allowed to have a blacklist because of legislation such as this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Olner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a sponsored member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. I have belonged to it since I was 16 and I am extremely proud of that membership.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment which highlights a word used in the title of the Bill—"rights." My collegues mentioned issues such as blacklisting and the additional difficulties of a membership list, relevant to Northern Ireland, falling into the wrong hands.<br><br>
I believe that the amendment should be accepted for two reasons. It is the democratic right of everyone in this country to determine at the ballot box in absolute secrecy the question that is posed. It is important that people know that their vote is secret. I should be concerned if voting papers or registers were to get into the wrong hands. Perhaps the Minister would consider replacing the word "scrutineer" with the words "returning officer". We should all be appalled if, under the democratic process that brought us to the House, registers and information about ballots were sold off to a third party. That is relevant not only to trade union ballots, but to ballots in other organisations.<br><br>
There is also that horrible term "canvassing". People can be put under considerable coercion from canvassing, should such lists fall into the wrong hands. The Minister would be well advised to accept the amendment as a fundamental part of the Bill so that trade union members can be sure that ballots are carried out correctly and in secret and that they have nothing to do with anyone else, bar the trade union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friends in urging the Government to accept the amendment. Although we may disagree on matters of principle, I hope that we agree on the importance of the privacy of individuals, the importance of a private ballot box, as my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton has mentioned, and the importance of ensuring that information in a trade union register cannot be passed on.<br><br>
Hon. Members have already mentioned the possibility—it is only a possibility—of names and addresses on the register being divulged to commercial organisations. That would be very worrying. On the day on which voting is to take place, a member may receive an advertisement for Whizzo washing powder. That is unlikely but possible, unless we incorporate safeguards in the legislation. More serious is the possibility of the list getting into the hands of someone who has reasons for wanting to know who is in a trade union or who wants to discourage people from becoming trade union members.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0361">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
The law provides—I hope it will remain the case—that, except in certain circumstances, a person cannot be dismissed for trade union membership, but unfortunately it is not illegal to discriminate against people who apply for jobs and it is not illegal to apply managerial pressure to discourage people from being trade unionists, or active trade unionists. I am a sponsored member of the Transport and General Workers' Union and I used to work for the National and Local Government Officers' Association, where I represented a large number of people in senior managerial positions who had decided that they wanted to belong to a trade union. They had taken that decision for all sorts of reasons, such as insurance purposes, or so that they would have somewhere to turn to, if they encountered difficulties at work. However, an increasing number of them felt under pressure because, even though they had not changed their minds about the importance of belonging to a trade union, they believed that the trade union was not popular with their employers and that membership of it might hinder their careers.<br><br>
Whatever one's view about the merits or otherwise of trade unions, surely it is unreasonable for an individual to feel under that sort of pressure? Even if an employer can find out who belongs to a trade union by other means, people have a right to expect that that information cannot be discovered from a membership register or a scrutineer.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
It is even more important, as my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn said, in non-unionised firms. New employees may wish to be part of a trade union, for many different reasons. They may even wish to talk to colleagues about the benefits or otherwise of setting up a trade union branch there without having that discussion messed around at the start by other people knowing about it. Their democratic right to decide whether to set up a local branch should not come under pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point, but it is not only people who wish to set up a trade union branch who may be affected. Individuals may wish to join a trade union not because they wish to encourage proliferation of membership among the work force, but simply because they wish to retain the general benefits of belonging to a trade union. They may, however, want to maintain their privacy, for their own protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. The message from Opposition members of the Committee is that, for many different reasons, people may wish to be part of a trade union. They may wish a trade union to be present in the workplace to negotiate on their behalf. They may have a personal commitment to membership of a trade union. They may even join a trade union for benefits concerning insurance, house purchase and so on. People join trade unions for many reasons. The message of Opposition members—I hope that it is shared by Conservative members—is that we must avoid the possibility of such information reaching a third party. That would be wrong.<br><br>
A more insidious aspect concerns organisations such as the Economic League. I regret that the league carries out its odious business in an unregulated way. There is no doubt that it affects the fives of employees. People who wish to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
find employment often cannot do so because of the blacklist. They may not know why they are on that blacklist.<br><br>
I saw a version of the Economic League's register some time ago and found myself on it. I was pleased to have made it on to that illustrious register, but the information about me was at least 10 years out of date. If any members of the Economic League are watching our proceedings or hear about that, perhaps they will check their records. I do not want a trade union register to be despatched to a third party to enable the Economic League to update their records and discriminate against people.<br><br>
I hope that there will be agreement on confidentiality. Privacy is important for individual trade unionists who wish to keep their membership private, for women in fear of domestic violence and for citizens in the north of Ireland who fear that action may be taken against them there. For all those reasons, and many more, I hope that the amendment will be accepted and that, united in the Committee, we can ensure that it becomes part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobsom</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee may be able to consider the matter more expeditiously if I say a few words in strong support of points that have been made on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
The two aspects of the matter are, first, general confidentiality and privacy and, secondly, security. We have in mind the prevailing circumstances in Northern Ireland, to which the hon. Member for Antrim, East (Mr. Beggs) referred. The security aspect is not confined to Northern Ireland. Throughout Britain, criminals have taken bank staff hostage to make it easier to rob a bank. They have also taken hostage the families of prison officers. If we can do anything to prevent such people from obtaining names, addresses and telephone numbers, all the better. People could obtain improper access to those details through trade unions' lists of members.<br><br>
An additional factor is family break-up. It is the policy of all Government Departments not to disclose the name and address of one party in a family break-up to any other party, whatever the purpose. People may argue about that, but that is the general principle of the Inland Revenue and DSS in all circumstances. Such confidentiality is properly pursued by the Government; trade unions should be in the same position and confidentiality should not be undermined by the actions—more likely by accident than villainy—of the scrutineer.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tiverton (Mrs. Browning) referred to random harassment of women by people hitherto known to them. Someone with access to a list of trade union members would have access to the names and addresses of many women who could then be subject to insane harassment.<br><br>
We all accept that trade unions will appoint scrutineers. Access by other people to trade union registers through scrutineers will be a limited problem, but it will be a problem. No matter how hard a trade union tries to obtain good scrutineers, some will be daft and casual. That raises the question of who will be scrutineers. They will generally be accountants, solicitors and others working in a partnership, so there may be the possibility of an enthusiastic junior solicitor or articled clerk who is handling a divorce case for a client taking the opportunity
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0362">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
to browse through the register when it is in the firm's offices. That would be improper conduct, but if it occurred it could be harmful and should be prevented.<br><br>
The main object of the amendment, imperfect as it may be in securing our objective, is to strengthen the position of the scrutineer so that he may be rigorous in maintaining the security of the information to which he has access and fending off anyone else.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister accepts the principle. From the way in which he has been nodding at the sage contributions from both sides of the Committee, I believe that that is a possibility. If disclosure of such information were made a punishable offence, that would strengthen the position of the scrutineer in preventing improper use of information.<br><br>
We should have a friendly and helpful response from the Minister. We do not insist on the wording of the amendment, but we believe that the principle should command the Government's support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. I am much moved by the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. He started the proceedings a few hours ago by saying that I should not take literally Opposition amendments because they were tabled to address matters of principle, rather than for their specific wording. That is the case with this amendment, so I shall be brief.<br><br>
The amendment is unacceptable because it would place an impossible duty on the scrutineer. He is obliged under the terms of his appointment to produce a report on union elections, and the existing law requires the union to make that report available to its members. It is, therefore, unrealistic to oblige the scrutineer not to transmit information to a third party. I do not think that that was what the hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras and for Strathkelvin and Bearsden had in mind. It is obvious, from their contributions, that hon. Members are concerned.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) all underlined the issues that were highlighted by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras about women, bank staff, prison staff and other groups who are at risk and about the importance of a right to privacy.<br><br>
I have been briefed to explain that, while the Government understand the issue of confidentiality and its importance, as the law stands, it is a matter for the union and not for primary legislation. In appointing a scrutineer, a union can include a requirement not to provide information to a third party and to maintain confidentiality in the contract, notwithstanding his statutory obligations.<br><br>
I sense that the Committee is not persuaded by my argument. As the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said, he wants further protection in the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and other hon. Members raised the question of the Data Protection Act 1984. The hon. Member for Delyn told us that trade unions have not quite caught up with the most modern methods—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not all of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not all of them have caught up with the most modern methods of compiling their membership lists and the use of computers. It is important that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
membership list should be on computer for the Data Protection Act to apply, but that alone would not be sufficient. The key test is whether the scrutineer obtains the information—on disks or tapes—from the computer.<br><br>
Although the Data Protection Act provides criminal defence for the disclosure of information in certain circumstances, it is clearly not adequate to meet the Committee's wishes.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Antrim, East (Mr. Beggs) stressed that although the Bill, when enacted, will not apply to Northern Ireland, British trade unions operating there will be subject to its provisions. The hon. Gentleman was right to draw the Committee's attention to that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) highlighted the importance of the right to privacy and was kind enough to express support for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which was appreciated by the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not for his policy, though.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have great hopes for the hon. Gentleman. He has not yet reached the high state of living and knowledge where he is able to go that far.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) spoke of intimidation—drawing, no doubt, on his experience as a shop steward in the Transport and General Workers Union.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde told us of his sponsorship by USDAW and of his concerns for shop stewards and other members of USDAW who did not support the union line on Sunday trading. I am sure that, as a Scottish Member, he must find difficulties with that line, because we have had a sensible attitude to Sunday trading north of the border for as long as I can remember.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The hon. Member for Northfield spoke about his experience in NALGO and his worries about lists falling into the hands of outside commercial organisations. He expressed the view that both sides of the Committee could at least unite on that matter. I suggest that we should heed his advice. If the hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras and for Strathkelvin and Bearsden feel able to withdraw the amendment, I shall come back with an amendment on Report that will address the issue of confidentiality. At that stage we can have further debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's assurances.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 2, line 34, after 'any', insert 'reasonable'.<br><br>
The amendment follows the theme that we have been trying to develop all morning. We are not attacking the principle of the clause but trying to assure that the Bill's nature and detail is correct and proper. The Bill is unusual, as it is rare for a statutory power to be laid down which has no limitations. Subsection (5A)(b) states that the trade union shall
<br><blockquote><p>"comply with any request made by the scrutineer to inspect the register."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0363">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
The examples that I give may sound silly. I am not suggesting that they might occur, but I use them to illustrate the point I am trying to make. What if the scutineer should decide to inspect the register in the middle of the night? According to the definition of "any request", the Bill, if enacted would enable him to decide to do that.<br><br>
Statutory registers are usually open to inspection only at stated times. For example, section 103(5) of the Financial Services Act 1986 states that the register is
<br><blockquote><p>"open to inspection free of charge but only at such times and places as the Secretary of State may appoint".</p></blockquote>
According to the Companies Act (Register of Auditors etc.) Regulations 1991 (S.I. 1566) the register of auditors is open to inspection for two hours a day between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. on "business days".<br><br>
I think that the Committee will understand my point. Why, in the Bill, is there a completely open-ended duty with no restrictions in force, when the normal procedure with statutory registers is to pull them in a bit more? We would like to introduce "reasonable" for that reason. I hear the Minister laugh.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am laughing at the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gailbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many folk laugh at my hon. Friend, including my hon. Friend himself. I thought the Minister was laughing at the word "reasonable", which appears all the time in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Section 24(3)(b) states that if a member requests details of what has been written in the register about him he should be supplied with those details as soon as "reasonably" practicable for a "reasonable" fee. Section 24(3)(a) states that a trade union shall tell a member if there is an entry relating to him if "reasonable" notice is given at a "reasonable" time. We do not ask for anything that is not contained in the 1992 Act. We ask that there should not be an open-ended commitment and that when we, quite rightly, establish rights we also impose duties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman is trying to achieve. However, I think that that would be covered in the Bill by the nature of the scrutineer and his appointment. The amendment would undermine the effectiveness of the scrutineer's right to inspect the union register. In order to carry out his functions, which would help the election to be fair, the scrutineer has to decide when to inspect the register. In those circumstances it would be inappropriate for the scrutineer to have to justify to the union on grounds of reasonableness the need for his inspection.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
It would be vital that the scrutineer, could act on a request without impediment and without needing to justify his actions. He must be allowed unrestricted access to the union's membership register. To limit the union's obligation to provide access only to those occasions when a reasonable request has been made could jeopardise the scrutineer's investigation. How would the scrutineer demonstrate the reasonableness of the request without revealing some of its substance? That might threaten the confidentiality of the identity of the union member, as we discussed at great length, or the candidate on whose behalf the scruntineer is acting. If a fraud were to occur involving union officials, should the scrutineer be obliged to reveal the perpetrators of the fraud, to reveal the nature of the investigation or to seek the union's permission to continue the investigation? I realise that that might not have been the intention of the amendment but that would be its effects.<br><br>
I share the hon. Gentleman's concerns, but we covered the same ground when we discussed earlier amendments. What we say in Committee now has a good deal more force than it did. Once the hon. Gentleman's concerns are set aside, the amendment has no justification. In carrying out his duties, the scrutineer would only make requests which were reasonable in the sense which the hon. Gentleman intends. It would be unnecessary—indeed, counterproductive—to specify that in the clause. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister accepts that we are not concerned about whether there are reasonable grounds—reasonable reasons—for inspecting the register. If the Minister is right about the amendment opening up the issue of reasonable grounds too much, I agree that the amendment would be defective.<br><br>
The Minister gave assurances about the duty of the scruntineer to behave in a reasonable manner. That would ensure that he would make only resonable requests which would take account of the time involved. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
