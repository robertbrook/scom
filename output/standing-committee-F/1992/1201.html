CAMPAIGNING ASSISTANCE IN ELECTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 8, in page 4, line 48, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"save that normal practices and assistance given to union officials and executive members in pursuance of their functions shall not be considered campaigning assistance".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 11 in page 5, line 12, after "any", insert "direct".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our understanding is that clause 3 provides that if a union gives campaigning help to one candidate, it will give help to all. There should be no favouritism. That provision is a slight variation on the slogan "one for all" but does not mean "all for one".<br><br>
We accept the principle that union elections should be fair and that the general resources of a trade union should not be used to serve some candidates but not others. We face the problem of how to enshrine that principle in law without making the situation worse rather than better.<br><br>
The main difficulty is that trade unions do not exist just to conduct elections to their executives: they exist for a host of other purposes and functions which have to be carried out continuously, including during an election. The unions are not concerned just with industrial disputes but with the day-to-day business of representing members, conducting negotiations, carrying out joint consultations, agreeing new working arrangements, making approaches with employers to the Government or to European institutions and being involved in training development. In addition, a trade union is a voluntary organisation with the continuous function of carrying out the process of two-way communication with its membership. That function involves visits by elected and appointed officials and meetings of the lay membership, officials and, sometimes, elected officials. It involves the production and distribution of journals and leaflets and the use of press offices and public relations. It is a continuous process.<br><br>
In most union elections, most, if not all, the candidates will also be involved in that day-to-day process. The problem of enshrining in law the Government's aims is exacerbated when incumbents are involved in union elections. Those people are not necessarily incumbents of the posts that are being elected but of other elected posts, or paid officials of the union who are not subject to election. They may be running against people who are not incumbents of posts, that are subject to re-election, who are not incumbents of already-elected posts, or who are not paid officials of the union.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
Having considered the problem carefully and having consulted with various sections of the trade union movement, we believe that it would be hard to tell whether a union official or an elected union representative would be going about ordinary business or election business.<br><br>
I have not consulted the general secretary of what was the Amalgamated Engineering Union but I shall use his regular visits to the Nissan plant in County Durham as an example. His visits are partly because of the single-union agreement between Nissan and the AEU. Sometimes he goes by train and takes a short car journey; sometimes he goes all the way by car. During the election for the post of general secretary he might visit Nissan. How would we distinguish between the facilities of the union rightly being made available to the general secretary of the AEU for his regular visits to Nissan, which benefit the membership and the employer, and his visit to that part of the country in order to further his election or re-election? He might be attending a branch meeting, or holding meetings with other parts of the union, or he might just be carrying out his normal visit to Nissan to meet representatives of the work force and the management.<br><br>
Visits made by Ministers during general elections or by-elections parallel those visits made by people running for trade union office. A careful study of the movements of Ministers during by-elections would show that they had pressing Government business in the constituency holding the by-election, in an adjacent constituency, or in a constituency nearby—.It would be exceedingly convenient for Ministers, going about their paid Government business in their paid-for-by-the-taxpayer car, to make a sneaking visit to the constituency holding the by-election. Nobody jibs at that.<br><br>
There are other aspects to be considered. Unions, other than through meetings, generally communicate with all their members by circular. It might be thought that if a circular were to be sent relating directly to an election, it should be sent by all the candidates on the one out, all out principle. But what would the union do about a business-as-usual circular which might be sent out by an incumbent as part of his day-to-day union business? Would that be affected by the provision? We fear that it might and that it could lead to a good deal of litigation.<br><br>
If the union journal, which is circulated to union members, were to have an article by one candidate, it should, according to the one in, all in principle, have articles by the others. That is clear, but there are practical, day-to-day problems. There may be a regular or, in some cases, impenetrable article in every issue of the journal signed by the president or the general secretary of the union, or by an incumbent in a different post. That regular communication with members could be lost. Would that ordinary business, which is not strictly related to the election, be caught by the provision?<br><br>
In addition, the union journal usually includes considerable coverage of the newsworthy activities of members of the union, and the incumbents are more likely to do something newsworthy because power is already vested in them. As the Opposition know, that can be a disadvantage. For example, the BBC applies a test in order to decide whether an item is sufficiently newsworthy to deserve coverage on the radio or in a television news bulletin. That test is greatly to the advantage of Ministers rather than to their opponents. Ministers pass the test
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0368">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
more often because, by announcing something, or deciding to do something, a Minister can be said to be doing something, which is more newsworthy than criticising something. Similarly, the union journal will tend to give greater coverage to the incumbents, who are doing something, than to the outside runner, who is likely, at the most, to be saying something.<br><br>
Furthermore, the trade union press office, quite rightly, and with the agreement of the membership, is at the disposal of the incumbents. It carries out functions related to the day-to-day business of the union and publicises the union's activities. Therefore, during a union election involving one of the incumbents, the press office will try to get the name of that incumbent on the radio, on television and into the newspapers. That must be an advantage, but is it an improper advantage that will be caught by clause 3?<br><br>
Candidates in an election may produce leaflets. However, according to one interpretation of clause 3, if any candidate were to produce a leaflet it would be the union's duty to investigate whether union resources had been used in its production. That is a far-reaching obligation. Alternatively, it might be said that the union should investigate only if a complaint were made that union resources had been used. And so it goes on.<br><br>
Invitations to branch meetings are another method of propagating the interests of candidates in an election. One might suppose that that was all right, as long as all the other candidates were also invited. But what should happen if one of the candidates is the nominee of a particular branch and, for geographical or trade reasons, enjoys the wholehearted support of that branch? Would, for example, a printers branch in Glasgow, motivated by a strong craft commitment to printing and a strong commitment to non-Scottish candidates, be obliged to invite all the other non-print, non-Scottish candidates to attend its branch meeting? And if it did not, would that union fall foul of the requirement to deal fairly with all the candidates? In other words, does the requirement for fairness to candidates apply right through from national to regional or branch level? If so, who can expect anyone to monitor all those sources of potential trouble and failure to comply with the law in a widely geographically-dispersed voluntary organisation?<br><br>
Let us consider another example: that the general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union visits the Nissan plant in County Durham, where there is a single-union agreement, and the management allows him to address all of, or a substantial proportion of, the work force. If that is done in the normal course of union activities, it is all well and good. If it is done in the course of an election in which the general secretary may be standing or supporting another candidate, will the union insist that the management of Nissan welcomes on to its premises someone who might be regarded as a loony trouble-maker because he happens to be standing for a union post? That aspect must be considered.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
We think that the clause is, to say the least, imperfect. Our amendments are equally imperfect. They certainly do not achieve all that we would want, but we do not think that the clause achieves what the Government want.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
The more we have considered the clause, the more we have come to the conclusion that it would be extremely difficult, with all the will in the world and with all the skill of the parliamentary draftsmen, to amend the clause in such a way as to meet the general requirement for fairness in elections and to cover all eventualities, without it leading to much stupid, time-wasting botheration for the union and possibly, in many cases, for managements as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste <span class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman speak about the length of time over which a union election might take place? What can one reasonably expect to be a contracted period for a formal election when the provisions might apply? How long will such a period be?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Spellar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I could assist my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), many of the craft unions, such as those representing engineers or electricians, drew up their rules a while ago. Nominations are made on a specified night—a star night or a quarter night—which could be, for example, in June. Three months would then pass before ballot papers could be dispatched because candidates must be written to, election addresses found and lawyers consulted. That could take up to six months.<br><br>
If the unions have a run-off provision between the top two candidates, the period could be extended for a further three months. Therefore, someone could be bound by the procedures for between six and nine months.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend said, even after the whistle has been blown to start an election, the procedure, under the rules of several unions, could be protracted for totally democratic purposes in order to give the entire electorate in the union the opportunity to consider the candidates and to give the candidates time to campaign.<br><br>
In many cases, the rules were drafted when a new group of people came to power in the union. Therefore, the union rules on elections have frequently been drafted to give outsiders a good chance, the general feeling being that the longer the election period the better chance the less-known outsider may have of being elected. An element of fairness springs deliberately from the length of time taken over an election.<br><br>
In addition, if the general secretary or the president of a union is very prominent, it is known that, unless he or she snuffs it within the next 18 months, he or she will cease to be the general secretary or the president of the union on a certain date. Therefore, informal electioneering and manoeuvring will take place well before the election is declared. That happens in parliamentary elections. In unions which are continuously electing members of the executive, the bulk of the year could be subject to those rules.<br><br>
The clause is well intentioned, which we support. We and the Trades Union Congress believe that there should be fairness between one candidate and another. Some trade unions go to great lengths in their rule books to secure that fairness, without the interference of the law. We are not sure that the Government's good intentions in the clause will be achieved. We are equally dubious about whether the Government's good intentions and ours would be brought about by our amendments. There seems to be every possibility that, instead of achieving
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0369">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
the smooth, fair and equal elections that the Committee wants, matters would be constantly loused up by vexatious litigants coming up with smart ideas that their lawyers had thought of and which neither the Committee nor the unions had thought of, resulting in the elections being in breach of clause 3. Perhaps the Government will reconsider the whole idea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Government's move in the clause. I spent many hours on Committee Benches in the early 1980s when, step by step, we gave trade unions the ability to provide more democracy and more fairness for their members. The clause provides a significant and important further step forward in giving trade union members a free and fair choice of candidates for executive or senior posts.<br><br>
I thought it important to discuss the matter with the TUC, and especially with the AEU. Some of the points raised by Opposition Members are important. The vexatious litigant has been the occupant of discussions on these Benches during every trade union Bill. I have got to know him quite well and was waiting for him to appear. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has produced with a flourish our friend the vexatious litigant, who crept into our deliberations in 1980, 1981, 1983 and 1984.<br><br>
The matter is important. Perhaps the Minister will say why a capricious candidate, or series of candidates, will be deterred as a result of the excellent proposal for fair and equal treatment. The amendment would certainly not prevent that. General elections are a great attraction because candidates are entitled to free postage. In my constituency, 79,000 households may receive information on what any candidate wishes to do. The deposit acts as an inhibitor and has been effective, but that does not apply to trade unions.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said that if vexatious or capricious candidates are given an equal opportunity, there could be difficulties for management: that if the incumbent has the right to make an address, perhaps six others should also have the right to do so. Work would stop. Mr. Nissan and Mr. Rover would not be too happy to see that happen on their shop floors. It is practical to seek reassurances from the Minister on this excellent matter, and, in addition, to ensure that the controls are fair and democratic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate on this matter. I know that the hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras and for Warley, West (Mr. Spellar) are committed to the principle of the clause, but are anxious about its practical implementation.<br><br>
I bow to the experience of the hon. Member for Warley, West in trade union matters and the experience of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras in by-elections, which he mentioned. I know that he was the minder in several by-elections, a couple of which were in London and which it may be indelicate of me to mention—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Vauxhall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was thinking of Vauxhall. I had no idea there were others. As he has drawn attention to Greenwich and Bermondsey, perhaps we should have a balanced view.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
During the consultation process on the Green Paper, it was interesting to note that five trade unions expressed support for the principles which are enshrined in the clause. As I was unkind to the Union of Construction Allied Trades and Technicians at the last sitting, perhaps I could quote UCATT:
<br><blockquote><p>"No one would wish to disagree with the sentiment behind this proposal".</p></blockquote>
Listening to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras and to my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills), that view extends across the Committee.<br><br>
However, as I listened to the hon. Member for Warley, West, having thought about this and having received representations from the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras even in advance of the discussion of the amendments, I see that there are some practical difficulties. I entirely endorse his view of the amendment which is that it will not do the job and that it is imperfect, and I can see difficulties arising with the clause.<br><br>
I do not believe that there is a problem in respect of the clause such that it would prevent an individual carrying out his official duties and making full use of the facilities of the union in doing so, where such facilities are normally provided.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras mentioned the example of printers in Glasgow. Far be it from me to be responsible for forcing printers in Glasgow to invite the English to their meetings, but that was highlighted as one of the difficulties that might arise. The hon. Member for Warley, West and my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden asked me to give assurances about the vexatious litigant. I am not sure that I can give assurances that the vexatious litigant would not appear.<br><br>
What the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has told the Committee is true. There will be grey areas, and no doubt there are people around who will wish to exploit those grey areas. I know of people on the extremes of political debate who might rather enjoy taking advantage of the clause, and that is a persuasive argument.<br><br>
I am in some difficulty. Everyone agrees with the principle. As the consultation process showed, there was considerable support for it, but there are difficulties in practice and those difficulties could result in expense, bother and difficulty for the trade unions concerned.<br><br>
The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 already provides that all candidates have a right to issue an election address, and places a duty on the union to ensure that any facilities and restrictions concerning the election address are applied equally to all candidates.<br><br>
When we started our proceedings, I said that we would listen to the arguments and not stand our ground for the sake of it. Given that there is a genuine commitment to ensure that the principles are enshrined, I think that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras is correct when he says that it is difficult to frame an amendment—he had difficulty, I had difficulty—and that perhaps the best solution is to remove the clause from the Bill.<br><br>
Were we to embark on such a course, we would not hesitate to return to the matter in future, should there be further evidence of the unions not heeding the advice that has been expressed by Committee members.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0370">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Batiste</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend help me? An example was given of the general secretary of a union visiting a car plant to make a speech related to the company's affairs, without referring specifically to any election, and of how odd candidates from all over the place might then insist on the right to address the work force. Such an example gives rise to considerable concern.<br><br>
Under the definition of "campaigning assistance" in clause 3, could that possibility arise? My understanding is that the clause only requires that unions should provide premises and support, not that the companies themselves should make such provision. As a consequence of companies having to make facilities available at the request of the unions, in accordance with collective agreements, could the companies and not just the unions be forced to provide the facilities described in the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The broad answer is, no. The clause deals with cases where union funds are provided. If union funds are involved in organising a meeting, then there might be an argument.<br><br>
The broader argument of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras is not about the scope and meaning of the clause, but about its scope for people to come along and create dissent, conflict and difficulty for the union, by trying to advance proceedings under the umbrella of the clause. There may be reasons why, for example, candidates on the extreme left, with no possibility of getting votes, might wish to create difficulties so as to draw attention to themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or the extreme right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dare say that that is a possibility, although it seems to me that in recent times the extreme left has featured more prominently in union affairs than the extreme right.<br><br>
Such occasions could occur. In the spirit of co-operation, which has been a feature of the Committee, I advise, somewhat unusually, my hon. Friends not to support the motion, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am devastated that this has happened at such an early hour. I feel like someone who has turned up to see the big fight, only to find that it is all over after round one. We are left with the young boys on the way up or, like me, the geriatrics on the way down. Everyone else has gone off to tea.<br><br>
The amendments are devastating as well, and I am sure that they will engross all Committee members for seconds upon seconds. The amendments involve inserting words like "reasonable" and are the stuff of which political futures and careers are made.<br><br>
The amendments follow a trend which we have been trying to introduce into our consideration of the Bill. We are not trying to attack any of the principles involved. We are trying to ensure a correct balance in the Bill between the trade union and the individual.<br><br>
Clause 4 relates to political fund ballots and clause 5 relates to ballots for amalgamations. Both clauses confer rights and duties. The Opposition are concerned to achieve the correct balance. When rights are conferred, certain duties should also be imposed. And when duties are imposed on a body such as a trade union, certain rights should also be given. But the duty imposed should be reasonable. An unreasonable duty should not be imposed upon anyone. That is the problem with schedule 1. Subsection (5)(a) of new section 77A of the 1992 Act states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The trade union shall ensure".</p></blockquote>
It is unusual for legislation to be so tightly knit and not give any leeway. We want to ensure that the duty imposed on a trade union is not unreasonable. We must strike the correct balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the point raised by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), who suggested that amendment No. 13 would import into schedule 1 the test of reasonableness, which has been the aim of the Opposition also during our discussion of previous amendments. But I contend that the test of reasonableness is already imported by the wording of subsection (5)(a), which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"is such as to make it reasonable for any person to call into question the independence of the person appointed in relation to the union".</p></blockquote>
That means that the union should ensure a reasonable result, and it provides the element of reasonableness.<br><br>
If, following a complaint, the matter were referred to a certification officer, and if the union had fulfilled its obligations in making the appointment, it would be able to argue that it had done a reasonable job. At the same time, the subsection will impose a discipline on the union. However, to add the phrase,
<br><blockquote><p>"use its best endeavours to"</p></blockquote>
would change the test from one that requires the results to be examined for reasonableness to one that examines precisely what the union has done. The subsection already includes an element of reasonableness. To add the phrase,
<br><blockquote><p>"use its best endeavours to"—</p></blockquote>

which would mean, "what could reasonably be done in the circumstances"—is unnecessary and likely to lead to litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I comment on schedule 1 and draw a distinction between the different sorts of ballot upon which the schedule will impose similar laws. The argument for reasonableness put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is important. The Bill deals with three distinct types of ballot: industrial action ballots, political fund ballots and elections for office in the union. Different issues are at stake in each. It is not proven that exactly the same, rigid system should be used to conduct each ballot.<br><br>
The schedule deals with the political fund ballot. I shall reinforce my hon. Friend's arguments about the need for reasonableness criteria, which the amendments would insert.<br><br>
A political fund ballot is meant to confirm whether a political fund should exist. That is different from an executive election in which people make choices about individuals, because, in a political fund ballot, the union will take a particular view. When the first round of political fund ballots took place in 1984 or 1985, there were more political fund ballots at the end of the process than at the beginning. The trade unions, were affiliated to the Labour party or to the Trades Union Congress or were what the commissioner of trade unions would call special registered bodies—indeed, some of us might not consider them trade unions at all. But, in almost all cases, the unions took decisions to recommend to their membership that a "Yes" vote be obtained. That does not happen in ballots for trade union executives as it would be quite improper for the union to recommend a particular candidate. We touched on that during the recent debate on the now withdrawn clause 3.<br><br>
Ballots about political funds are also different because there is a vested interest. There are two types of political fund: the first is used by unions such as the National and Local Government Officers Association, which is not affiliated to the Labour party, to pursue its political interests as defined in law—that was widened by previous Conservative trade union legislation. The second type of political fund concerns unions which are directly affiliated to the Labour party.<br><br>
I have heard a rumour that there are Conservative trade unionists in some trade unions. Such unions—and we must assume that the myth is true—contain a group of politically motivated, vexatious litigants—which relates to what the hon. Member for Meriden said earlier—who have a positive, political vested interest in causing as much trouble for the political fund ballot as possible.<br><br>
We are declaring interests in the Committee and all Conservative Members should declare an interest. If they could disrupt, interfere with, or hold up the progress of political fund ballots, they would be dealing a possibly awkward financial blow to their major political opponent and that is extremely worrying in a democracy. We must consider that issue carefully because it is an argument for increasing the reasonableness test, as proposed in the amendment.<br><br>
Was there a problem with the previous round of political fund ballots? Was a problem perceived with the way in which those ballots were run? I spent the first part of my time with the Confederation of Health Service
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
Employees helping to run the political fund ballot. We were allowed to run our own balloting procedures internally, and I can assure the Committee that it never crossed our minds to fiddle the result, whether we were independent scrutineers or associated with the union.<br><br>
I get a little fed up with people impugning the integrity of people who work in trade unions and suggesting that those connected with trade unions would try to fiddle a ballot result. Those of us who are democrats—and all Opposition members are democrats—could be trusted as much as any independent scrutineer. I assure Conservative Members that when COHSE ran its own political fund ballot, there was no intention of interfering with the result.<br><br>
11.15am<br><br>
There was an overwhelming vote of more than 90 per cent on a fairly high turnout in favour of COHSE's political fund ballot. It used different ways of voting to deal with a complex and extremely busy hospital work force which, because of shift working, found it difficult to get to certain places. The mixture allowed people to choose whether they wanted a workplace ballot or a postal vote. We ensured that the vote was secret and that caused no problems. I sat on the trade union co-ordinating committee which co-ordinated a campaign for political fund ballots in all trade unions. The Committee found no problems with political fund balloting procedures in any union affiliated or not.<br><br>
It is odd that the Conservatives are fiddling with something that works. Are they Conservatives or are they into revolutionary change? Why change something that has worked well? Perhaps they want to change it because they did not like the result of the previous political fund ballot in which every union involved voted for a political fund. I believe that seven or eight political funds were set up as a result of that procedure.<br><br>
We need the reasonableness criterion because there would be potential for the worst creature—the politically-motivated vexatious litigant—to occur. I want to hear strong arguments as to why the amendment should not be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate and I am sorry that I cannot agree with the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden that we might follow in the light of the debate on the previous clause. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald) for explaining that the test of reasonableness is provided for in the clause.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) made several points. First and foremost, she seemed surprised that there were Conservatives in trade unions: there are and many of them voted for us in the past four general elections which overwhelmingly showed their support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Was my hon. Friend the Minister a trade union member when he was involved in industry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend. I had the great pleasure of being a member of the National Union of Mineworkers. My association president during the 1983 general election wrote to the NUM asking for a

contribution to my fighting fund. I shall not go into all the reply—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would certainly be out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it would be out of order. The reply referred to
<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. P. McLoughlin a Parliamentary Candidate standing in Wolverhampton South East Constituency in the coming general election on behalf of the Conservative party."</p></blockquote>
I think that instead of the full stop the NUM meant to put an exclamation mark or a question mark. It went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Additionally, under Rule 48(1) the Area Political Fund is prohibited from making payments other than those used forthe propagation of Labour Politics in harmony with the Labour Party Constitution."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make two points about that. Given that there are Conservative trade unionists—and I accept that and we are working on it—the Minister has confirmed my point about the existence of possibly large numbers of politically-motivated vexatious litigants who might interfere with the process.<br><br>
Secondly, in the light of what has happened with pit closure programmes, who could say that the NUM was wrong to deny sponsorship to the Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going down that road, Mr. Hogg, as you may rule me out of order.<br><br>
I will deal with a few of the points raised by the hon. Lady which are worthy of response. She talked about the damage that was done and went on to say how successful the ballots that were held previously had turned out to be. She said that there had been a fairly high turnout in the ballots for political funds. In fact the turnout was only 40 per cent. Personally, I do not regard 40 per cent as an overwhelming turnout, but we can argue about that.<br><br>
The ballots took place, there was a turnout and the principles were overwhelmingly, I accept, endorsed. Why do Opposition Members find it so difficult to accept that we should proceed with a postal ballot? The hon. Lady said there were three relevant issues, but as a result of the legislation there will be four. Elections, political funds and merger will be treated under the same rules and the proposals relating to industrial action ballots will be treated differently. There is something to be said for having common guidelines throughout the ballots that are to be held.<br><br>
That is why I cannot recommend to hon. Members that we accept the amendment. I would also point out that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North, covered the point where a test of reasonableness already applies to the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be introducing several new beasties. We had creepy-crawlies last week, we have had vexatious litigants and now we have politically-motivated vexatious litigants. I am interested to see what other bodies appear.<br><br>
I understand the point that has been made about the word "reasonable", but again the balance is wrong. I take the point made by the Minister. I can envisage long legal hours being spent discussing this, but the balance is then
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
in favour of the individual and there is no balance here on the basis of the trade union.<br><br>
However, we have received some assurances from the Minister. The amendment is not one that we wish to pursue, and therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

Clause 5</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
BALLOTS FOR UNION AMALGAMATIONS AND TRANSFERS OF ENGAGEMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 6, line 5, leave out from "to" to end of line 7 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to change the regulations laid down by the Secretary of State for the qualifications of the certification officer who will carry out the ballot. As it stands within the Bill at present, the matter only requires annulment. We would like to see a change so that the provision requires an affirmative resolution of the House which must be debated and voted on. That is the important difference, because the certification officer is a very important individual.<br><br>
This is not like some of the regulations that have come before the House, for example, regulations in respect of the number of times sheep have to be dipped. It covers the qualifications of the certification officer, which is a very important post. That is especially important when considering the drift in the certification officer's functions under the Bill.<br><br>
Since its inception in the mid 1970s, certification officer has been a hybrid post with two functions. One is a purely administrative function of responsibility for the register—holding the register of trade union members and ensuring that it is maintained. That is a non-controversial function, but the certification officer also has a quasi-judicial function and may sit in parallel with the High Court. He has both administrative and judicial functions, which do not conflict, and the relationship with the trade unions is good.<br><br>
The problem in the Bill is that under new section 45C to the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, the certification officer is given a third function—an investigating and prosecuting function.<br><br>
I see notes being passed—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman does not see notes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall return to the matter when we come to clause 10, but it seems that the nature of the certification officer is being changed from a hybrid administrative and judicial role to include an investigating and prosecuting function. He will investigate, prosecute and judge and that is not a proper function for the certification officer.<br><br>
The qualifications of the certification officer are important and the matter must not be allowed to slip
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0373">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
through the House without being debated and voted upon. The matter is so important that it must be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's explanation of why he believes that the matter should be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. However, the clause covers the appointment not of the certification officer, but of scrutineers. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman intended to make that clear.<br><br>
The provisions of the proposed new section 100A(2) to the 1992 Act replicate those already found in section 49(2) on the scrutiny of union election ballots and section 75(2) on the scrutiny of political fund ballots.<br><br>
The orders made under those provisions are subject to the negative resolution procedure, rather than the affirmative resolution procedure proposed by the amendment. We want to be consistent and to maintain continuity without having different rules for different functions. That should be welcome, bearing in mind what the hon. Member for Wallasey said about different circumstances for different kinds of ballots.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way. On consistency, does he agree that a similar stripped and particularised rule should apply to other ballots—for example, those on opted out schools? If we want consistency, surely we should seek that elsewhere and not just within the trade union movement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not go down the route of schools becoming grant maintained because that is being discussed in another Committee and it would not be for the convenience of this Committee if I dealt with that.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
It may be helpful if I give the reference of the relevant order, which was the Trade Union Ballots and Election (Independent Scrutineer Qualifications) Order 1988, SI 1988, No. 2117, as amended by the Trade Union Ballots and Elections (Independent Scrutineer Qualifications) (Amendment) Order 1989, SI 1989, No. 31. We are trying to achieve consistency.<br><br>
It may help the Committee and especially the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden if I say that the Government intend to introduce in due course an order to apply the same qualifications to scrutineers of ballots on union mergers, as currently apply to qualifications for scrutineers for union elections or political fund ballots.<br><br>
I hope that that reassures the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden that we shall provide the opportunity to discuss the order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note the Minister's comment and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 6, line 25, after "such", insert "reasonable".<br><br>
Again, our argument is that if duties are imposed, they must be reasonable. If rights are provided, as the clause provides for the scrutineer, they must be reasonable. New section 100A(3)(c) to the 1992 Act states:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"to take such steps as appear to him to be appropriate for the purpose of enabling him to make his report".</p></blockquote>
I do not understand why the word "reasonable" is not included when it is included in other parts of the Bill. A good basis of law is that instead of indirect methods by which reasonableness may be attained, it should be included where it is relevant so that there can be no dubiety and so that no discussions or legal wrangles are necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point was that reference to "reasonableness" or "best endeavours" is a vague concept in law. The draftsmen has tried to nail that concept down more tightly. That has been done in the clause with the words
<br><blockquote><p>"such steps as appear to him to be appropriate for the purpose of enabling him to make his report".</p></blockquote>
The steps that will be taken will be entirely governed by that purpose. The requirement has been nailed down more tightly and there will be less chance of litigation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point and I hope that the matter can be discussed. He said that "reasonableness" is a vague concept but that word appears throughout the Bill. The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North accepts that this is a difficult concept to define and that the draftsmen have tried to tighten it by various means.<br><br>
The point that I am making is that one can get a balance by making it as tight as possible, but also by ensuring that the balance is correct and the rights go to the right person. Is it not better to apply the criteria to an individual on his or her behaviour? The terms on which that is to be applied ought to be applied directly rather than indirectly through circumferential means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are occasions when the word "reasonable" has to be applied. "Such depths as are reasonably practicable" is a classic example. Often, it can be pinned down to the purposes within a certain clause. If that can be done, it is a great bonus in legal terms because it reduces the chances of litigation. It is a much simpler test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That highlights my argument and I accept the hon. Member's point. He is obviously of the view that this is done better by circumferential means. I remain convinced and would be grateful for the Minister's views.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have the impression that my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North has again given the explanation which I could put in a longer way if the hon. Member wishes me to pursue that. That requirement is already in place. Ever since the requirement for independent scrutiny of union elections and political funds ballots was introduced into the law by the Employment Act 1988, those provisions have operated well.<br><br>
It is not the case, of course, that just any person or body can be qualified to act as the scrutineer of either a union election ballot, a political fund ballot, or—as proposed—of a union merger ballot. Scrutineers are—and will be—responsible professionals, or organisations with special expertise in that area. They are not, I would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0374">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
suggest, the kind of people given to improperly using powers available to them to make "unreasonable" demands. I do not understand why the Opposition appear to believe that this is a real possibility. Does the hon. Member wish to come back to me on that point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North, expanded on why we see the need for the legislation to remain as it is currently worded. The hon. Member's proposal would not add anything to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We can agree that we have had a reasonable discussion, when "reasonable" ought to be used. Being a reasonable man, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 14, in page 8, leave out lines 29 to 36.<br><br>
It will become immediately obvious to everyone that the amendment is intended to promote discussion on postal balloting in the various forms of union elections. It is a subject on which my hon. Friends who have been involved in trade unions as full-time officials, will wish to say something.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said earlier, there are different ballots and perhaps different procedures need to be used in respect of those ballots. The clause introduces a postal ballot for amalgamation and transfers of engagements.<br><br>
It is a well established fact that postal ballots have a lower turnout than ballots at the workplace.<br><br>
I am in the unfortunate position of being a member of the British Medical Association and the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union which conduct ballots in dissimilar manners. The BMA holds virtually all postal ballots. When the envelope comes in, it says BMA at the top and immediately goes into the wastepaper basket without being opened. Such is the correspondence we normally receive from the BMA.<br><br>
With the MSF, some of the ballots are held in the workplace and there is generally a higher turnout. That is my own personal experience of those ballots. There is no reason why a postal ballot should be mandatory in transfers of engagements or amalgamations of trade unions. Therefore we seek to remove this subsection from the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hanson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: While we are considering the amendment introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, the Labour party wants to know what objectives the Government have in introducing the clause. I would welcome the Minister's views, but I presume that the Government's objectives are to allow as many people involved in the trade union movement as possible to participate in the amalgamation ballot, to have full information about the issues on which they are voting, and to have an understanding of how a particular issue would affect their membership of the union and their daily lives in the workplace.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
All those laudible objectives are shared by Labour Members. If a ballot by post to a home address or some other address is maintained, those objectives might be mitigated against. As my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has said, in many cases a postal ballot sent to a home address would go behind the clock or in the bin, would not deal with the issues of the ballot and would not therefore, achieve the Government's objectives.<br><br>
If the suggestion made by my hon. Friend that we consider alternative forms was accepted, postal ballots certainly could play a role. However, I think that we should consider introducing a flexibility that would allow the scrutineer and the union to choose how votes should be cast so that those objectives would be met to the fullest extent.<br><br>
In some cases, a workplace ballot rather than a postal ballot would mean a higher turnout, a better discussion of issues and more people understanding and voting on those issues. Some workplaces—often larger ones—with workplace ballot boxes, have meetings where issues can be discussed. People often sit around in a room such as this or, perhaps, a canteen, and say, "Have you voted yet? Have you voted on this particular issue?" or, "Where's the ballot box? Oh, the ballot paper is at home with the post." People might not vote. If there is a workplace ballot box, people can vote at the workplace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Sykes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman recall stating that, as far as he was concerned, the Palestinian people had an inalienable right to self-determination? Does not he think that such decisions should be taken by the family and that the family should be able to exercise such rights?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) must not answer that question because it was out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the clause, I believe that the family has a role in discussions. At the end of the day, however, an individual pays a union fee and an individual votes.<br><br>
I presume that the hon. Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) wants individuals to be able to vote in secret and in privacy. That provision is included in the Bill. While a general discussion among the family might be helpful, it does not meet the Government's objectives in the legislation because we are dealing with secret ballots. I want flexibility. If the Government's objectives are maximum turn-out, understanding the issues, and ability to vote, they can be achieved by a trade union and a scrutineer considering whether a postal ballot is appropriate, as it will be for some unions.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
There might be a case for flexibility and discussion in other unions, other types of ballot and other workplaces, but, if agreed to, the clause will prescribe the way in which voting takes place. That will reduce flexibility and, in the long term, will defeat the Government's objectives in proposing the legislation.<br><br>
If I could refer to the Palestinian issue in reply to the hon. Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) I would, but, unfortunately, that has been ruled out of order.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 51</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his earlier remarks, the Minister suggested that it was not the Government's intention to place unnecessary financial burdens on trade unions. I hope that the Government will pursue that principle when they listen to arguments put forward by Opposition Members. There are important financial matters to consider, particularly in the context of postal ballots and whether they should be funded by the state or the trade union.</span></p>
<p>[Mr. David Knox <i>in the Chair]</i></p>
<p>In an earlier reply, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary made an important observation about the role of the scrutineer, which is critical. Last week, we discussed the need for the scrutineer to be a person of high standing who is held in high regard by all parties in a trade union and I agree with that. Against that background, will the Government consider whether it is proper to place unnecessary constraints on the role of the scrutineer in carrying out his or her affairs?</p>
<p>My second point is about amalgamations and transfers of undertakings. They are not simple processes that can be defined in one sentence. There are many different types of transfers of undertakings which may affect a group of workers, such as a small staff association in one building. Is it really wise or sensible to do any more than is done during a general election? During a general election, proper secret balloting facilities are established under the control of that person of integrity—the scrutineer—and the ballot is conducted in that building with the proviso that any person who, for good reason, is unable to attend the ballot, has a proper right to vote. That practice is adopted in electing Members to Parliament and it relies on the integrity of the scrutineer. Therefore, in the transfer of engagement of such a staff association in a single building or a small group of buildings, it is unnecessary to require the scrutineer to conduct the ballot in that way.</p>
<p>There are other groups of workers for whom the exact opposite would be the case. For example, in the case of a staff association covering a national sales force which is roving from its home base rather than from its factory base, the opposite would occur. Even in the context of people whose contracts require them to move around the country, it is wrong to define in precise terms the way in which the ballot should be conducted.</p>
<p>Increasingly, there are groups of workers, for example, service engineers who look after complex electronic equipment, whose contracts require that they rove on a periodic basis, only returning to their homes once in a while. That is quite a common practice. Indeed, one Labour Member who was elected at the previous election had such a contract and I know that because I was the official who looked after his contract of employment. In that case, it would have been totally impracticable for him to participate in all balloting arrangements had the specific requirement been that the only method of voting was through his home address. His contract was such that, temporarily, his employer could require him to work from Scotland or anywhere else.</p>
<p>The clause states that the individual can define another address, but then he is caught in the constraints established by his employer who might, at short notice, request him to go and work somewhere else.</p>

on balloting arrangements. If the ballot was conducted at the workplace, that would provide unnecessary problems for the trade union and for the individual.</p>
<p>In the context of issues such as transfer of engagements and union mergers, the needs and perceived benefits need to be discussed in great detail at a local level because the needs as perceived by one group of workers might be different from those perceived elsewhere in the country. Those debates need to take place as close as possible to the workplace. There are circumstances in which such ballots might be conveniently conducted through the post, but to describe it as an absolute rule is, in my view, unnecessary.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hutton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is probably true to say that there is a consensus in the Committee that it is beneficial for there to be maximum participation by union members in democratic decision-making processes. I hope that Conservative Members will see the contributions of my hon. Friends in that light. We want to achieve the maximum participation rate possible in all balloting and democratic decision-making processes in the trade union movement.<br><br>
The amendment raises several issues. Why do the Government believe that a universal balloting system should be imposed on the trade union movement? Such a belief does not allow for flexibility and speed of response, which are sometimes necessary. Why, specifically, does a fully postal balloting system command such complete support from the Government? As I have already said, we are committed to improving the participation rate because that is the key to securing real democracy in the trade union movement.<br><br>
I spent two years at Templeton college in the early 1980s working for Roger Undy and Rod Martin, who produced what is perhaps the most comprehensive study of British balloting practices. As my hon. Friends the Members for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) and for Delyn said, if our objective is to improve participation rates, it is imperative to be flexible in the balloting system that we impose on the trade union movement. The evidence in the Undy and Martin study is compelling and makes it clear that—to be—successful, the Government will have to be flexible. There is no reason why the Committee should not decide that, in some cases, a semi-postal ballot might be as effective as a full postal ballot, or that workplace ballot would achieve the objective of a properly conducted, democratic ballot.<br><br>
New clause 100C, particularly subsections 1 to 3 and 5, would make additions to the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. The new clause would give trade union members ample protection in the conduct of a ballot on the merger of a trade union. The pattern in the new clause is familiar—we have seen it in other Government provisions. It is rightly designed to achieve a democratic, fair, neutral and properly conducted ballot. Subsection 4, however, is offending and alien and there is no reason for it. It does not achieve a particular objective other than to maximise the annoyance factor of the trade unions. Some of us suspect that to be a Government ambition. Also, more significantly, it would be likely to depress the participation rates in ballots. That would not be beneficial to trade union democracy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sometimes feel that the argument about postal ballots is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0376">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
similar to that about the emperor's new clothes—it is a given truth that postal ballots will inevitably be more democratic and fair than other ballots. In some cases, postal balloting would be entirely appropriate and would be the most democratic way to conduct a ballot, but that is not the case in all circumstances. Before we impose new obligations on trade unions to conduct postal ballots in areas where it is not required at present, we need to consider the evidence on postal ballots.<br><br>
One criterion against which the democratic credentials of a system could be tested would be the participation rate. Many of my hon. Friends referred to the fact that full postal balloting in many circumstances could depress the participation rate rather than assist it. The figures back that up. We are not discussing the election of general secretaries, but my example gives an idea about the problem. The Transport and General Workers Union workplace ballot in 1984 for the position of general secretary had a turnout of only 38.9 per cent which was not as high as I would have liked. In 1991, that ballot was conducted under new rules and was fully postal. The turnout was lower at only 22.6 per cent. There are similar examples in other unions. Postal ballots have not necessarily aided the cause of democracy and participation. Until we have proof that it would always aid that cause, it would be misguided to take away from the union and the scrutineer the right to use discretion on the imposition and extension of postal ballots.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey referred to the situation of employees working in the national health service. Given the range of different occupations in the NHS, it is misguided to think that a fully postal ballot, with ballot papers distributed to people's home addresses and completed ones posted back, is the most convenient method for the voter. There is a whole range of occupations—my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred to mobile employees, which includes a large number of employees who do not touch base at home very frequently—</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like us, indeed. To insist that we should impose this irrespectively, because it is most appropriate for the voter to vote by post, seems misguided. Whenever any ballot takes place, postal or workplace, when any election takes place, any vote on a merger or vote in relation to the transfer of undertakings, it is in the interests of any trade union to ensure that the ballot is as fair as possible because that means that the result will not be open to challenge. It is in the interests of the union that that ballot has as high a participation rate as possible, because only with a high participation rate does the credibility of that ballot rise.<br><br>
Government Members feel that trade unions and trade unionists like low participation and dodgy ballots. It is just not true. In every situation, it is in the interests of the union and union officials to have high participation and high levels of democracy. Given that that is in their interests, it is surely not unreasonable to say that in union mergers, transfers of undertakings, regulations and so on, they should have some discretion about how to ensure that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
The issues involved in union mergers may be quite complex and detailed. What are the costs and benefits for the members in that merger? What will happen to their old organisation? What new structures will be developed? What sort of questions will they have? The union itself will want to address those issues, to ensure that when people vote, that vote is as informed as possible and takes place after individual members have had the chance to put questions, have them answered, and then make then-own decisions.<br><br>
In order to ensure that that process takes place, it may be in the interests of both the individual and the union to say that it is more convenient to distribute ballot papers at a particular time, when people can be encouraged to come along to discuss the issues and hear the arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Batiste</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely what is in the Bill does not prevent the union from having a meeting to explain the purpose behind the ballot. The issue is, where is the ballot paper best sent and how is it best distributed? The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) has not dealt with intimidation and fraud, and whether the mechanism of the postal ballot is more effective in preventing either of those.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any evidence that in all situations the postal ballot will tackle those problems where they exist. If the union and members feel that they would like to distribute the ballot papers and have those questions answered, with discussion taking place at the same time, who are we to say that they should not be allowed to do so? We are not arguing against postal ballots as a matter of principle because in many cases, they are the most democratic and the best way to do things. There are other situations where this may not be the case. Perhaps our dividing line is different to that of Opposition Members, but surely there must come a point where it is inappropriate for legislation to intervene, and for rules to be laid down which do not meet the specific situation for specific union members in specific merger debates. That is the basis upon which we ask that the amendment be accepted, so that the law does not intervene in cases in which it has not been demonstrated that it would be more effective and that it is necessary to intervene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to make a short intervention about the cost of postal balloting. Democratic issues such as turnout have been well dealt with by my hon. Friends.<br><br>
I shall use as an example an election held by the Confederation of Health Service Employees for the post of national vice president in 1990 and the cost of conducting that election, as the law now requires, by postal ballot. The overall cost was about £55,000. It is difficult to achieve high turnouts in postal ballots, in which the reason for voting is so fractured and separate from the workplace. We do not approve of low turnouts, but they are our experience. The turnout in that ballot was 18.26 per cent.<br><br>
Conservative members of the Committee will doubtless say that the £55,000 can be reimbursed, but that is only partially true. Aspects of expenditure are being forced on trade unions by the legislation and they cannot be reimbursed. First, there are the administration costs of constantly holding ballots. In COHSE, we have a rolling timetable of regional executive elections so that they do
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0377">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
not all happen at once. Therefore, it is possible to be constantly balloting throughout the year. Those costs are not quantified or repaid.<br><br>
Secondly, there are the costs of conversion of membership tapes, the insertion of material and the sealing of envelopes. All these aspects occur in a postal ballot. That cost £6,840, which cannot be reimbursed by law. Furthermore—this aspect is being extended under the provisions of the Bill—the cost of scrutineers cannot be reimbursed. In my example, the Electoral Reform Society of Great Britain and Ireland Ltd provided scrutineers, counted the ballot and advised COHSE on the conduct of the ballot. That cost COHSE £3,162.50.<br><br>
The legislation imposes considerable costs. The further we move towards postal ballots, the greater the costs that are imposed on trade unions which, unlike private companies, cannot simply raise capital to cover them. Trade unions have a limited funding basis, as Conservative members of the Committee know.<br><br>
I want an assurance that if postal balloting procedures are pursued to such an extent, there will be reconsideration of the costs that can be reimbursed to trade unions. If an organisation has rules imposed upon it from outside, it is wrong that its costs cannot be reimbursed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Robert Spink <span class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that all members of the Committee agree with the general aim of the Bill, which is that elections should be able to take place without interference or restraints. That is the aim of subsection 100C(4).<br><br>
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred to the general election voting arrangements. I believe that he was arguing against himself. Great care is taken to ensure that the place of voting is independent and completely free from any pressure. Subsection 100C(4) puts voting arrangements into a domestic context, free of any pressure or intimidation that might occur in the workplace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that instance, is the hon. Gentleman arguing for a fully postal ballot in a general election, or is not a ballot box at a polling station independent and free, from intimidation? Why the difference?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Spink</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not making that inference. I was arguing for a completely independent election free from any sort of pressure, interference or constraint. That cannot be achieved successfully in the workplace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You were arguing—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was not arguing anything.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. member for Castle Point (Dr. Spink) was arguing that a ballot in the home would be free from intimidation, but as happens during general elections when many women are intimidated into voting by members of their families, men might also be intimidated. Just because a ballot is in the home, it does not necessarily mean that it will be free and fair, and it is certainly not secret.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Spink</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to take up that issue. My point was that it may not be wholly unhealthy to inquire
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
into the domestic context behind the decision regarding which way to vote in a strike ballot—for example, how next week's bills will be paid. It is not improper for such decisions to be taken in the wider context of family pressure.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) spoke eloquently about the possibility of the postal vote depressing participating in elections. I think that he was arguing against himself when he mentioned peripatetic workers. That trend will increase as different types of work—networking, homeworking, flexible working contracts—play a greater role in the economy. Those people are more likely to be able to vote if they are given the opportunity to vote by post. Therefore, I support the postal ballot. It will increase democracy in voting decisions and increase participation, because it will give everyone who wants to the opportunity to vote. Voting rates may fall because, in a democracy, people also have the right to choose to abstain. In fact, we shall see the absurd spectable of hon. Members tabling amendments and abstaining from the vote on them in the House of Commons. Opposition Members look at me incredulously; I wonder what they will do tomorrow evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all in favour of greater participation in ballots. Deleting the proposed lines of clause 5 will create no difficulty because the 1992 Act provides that everyone will be given a convenient opportunity to vote by post. However, the wording of lines 31 to 36 worries me. As it refers only to the masculine gender, does it mean that lady members of trade unions will not be allowed to participate in the post ballot?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging debate with contributions from most Opposition members, but I did not think that any of them gave a convincing reason why we should not accept the current wording of the Bill.<br><br>
The Government believe that the law on ballots should be brought into line with the arrangements for ballots on other important union decisions—that is, union elections and political fund ballots. The amendment would remove the requirement that voting in merger ballots should be conducted by postal voting, as is the case currently with union election and political fund ballots. No Opposition member has given a convincing reason why ballots on union mergers should not be consistent with other ballots.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain his argument in favour of the clause and why all ballots should be conducted in the same way when the issues raised in the ballots are very different?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to cover that in the comments that I am about to make.<br><br>
There has been much discussion on the necessity for ensuring that people have information on the important matters that would arise in any merger. I draw attention to section 99 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which requires steps to be taken to ensure that people have the information necessary to make a proper decision. We shall have the opportunity later to ensure that that information is sent out with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0378">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
voting papers. Far from reducing the amount of knowledge that trade union members will receive, we hope to increase it.<br><br>
Legislation on union mergers has remained unchanged since the Trade Union (Amalgamations, etc.) Act 1964, which left it to unions to decide what method of voting should be used for ballots which are required by law before mergers can take place, although the balloting process is not wholly unregulated by that legislation.<br><br>
Since 1988, however, ballots that are similar to merger ballots—for example, those involving a large proportion or all of a union's membership—have had to be conducted by full postal voting and are subject to independent scrutiny. Those requirements for union elections and political fund ballots are widely recognised to be appropriate as the means of protecting members' interests and democratic rights.<br><br>
I hope that it is unnecessary to debate the proposition that full postal ballots, which are subject to independent scrutiny, are likely to afford ordinary union members greater assurance about the proper conduct of such ballots by their union than any other voting method.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have the Government any examples of the existing law being broken and intimidation occurring at the voting place in ballots that do not have to be conducted by post at present—for example, on trade union disputes? If the Government can give no such examples, why are they insisting on a method of voting that will clearly lead to a lower turnout?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the turnout will be lower. If a proposed union merger is important and arouses significant passion, people will vote. It is not unusual for voters to return ballot papers with no marking on them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tory leadership elections.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Tory leadership elections and perhaps constituency nominations for Labour party candidates. I do not think that we want to pursue that matter today.<br><br>
It is important to ensure that full postal balloting takes place on proposed union mergers. Paragraph 5.6 of the 1987 Green Paper states why we believe that full postal ballots are most appropriate. The 1991 Green Paper proposed similar protection for union members in respect of ballots on union mergers as they enjoy in respect of election and political fund ballots.<br><br>
It is interesting to consider the way in which proposals are being made for merger and why it is important to introduce the provision. During the 1980s, the impact of mergers on union membership clearly increased. The 171 mergers between 1968 and 1979 involved just under 750,000 members; between 1979 and 1989 there were fewer mergers—138 in total—but they involved nearly five times as many members: over 3.5 million. That, in itself, was a compelling reason to look again at the law, to ensure that members' interests and rights were properly protected in mergers.<br><br>
I am surprised and disappointed that the Opposition do not, apparently, share our concern that union members
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
should be able to depend on the law to ensure that they have the opportunity of a full postal vote on important issues such as the future existence of their unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give us an example that has come to his Department's attention of people taking part in a merger ballot who have been dissatisfed with the balloting procedure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to ensure that union members have the opportunity of a full postal ballot. The Opposition have failed to provide a convincing reason against a full postal ballot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister gave the best reason, which concerns the integrity of the scrutineer. If the scrutineer is the fine, upstanding person envisaged by the legislation, it should be within his or her power to determine the method by which the election is to be conducted. Should not that person's credibility give confidence to all participating members of the trade union?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The scrutineer is there to ensure that the ballot result is reflected fairly and adequately. We have dealt with examples along those lines. It is important, however, for members to have the opportunity of a postal ballot so that they can take decisions in private. There would be nothing to stop unions from organising meetings so that they can express their belief that an issue is of such importance that a merger should go ahead. I fail to be convinced that our proposals would threaten that option.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will recognise that some of the most frequently used ballots are those which companies have allowed to be factory-based. Such ballots have been participated in by 80 to 90 per cent, of the work force. That is conclusive proof that democracy prevails in such ballots.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having taken part in several factory-based ballots, I would much prefer to be able to exercise my right to vote on whether I should strike, or which union leader I should elect, in the privacy of my own home rather than at the top of a work face, just before the start of a shift. That seems to be a more acceptable proposal than that made by the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Patrick Nicholls <span class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend agree that, no matter how efficient the scrutineer may be, he can only deal with the situation as he finds it? Is not it in the privacy of one's own home where, having listened to all the arguments and debates in the workplace, one has the greatest freedom to make up one's own mind? Does not my hon. Friend also find it somewhat sinister that Opposition Members are apparently unprepared to allow union members to use their judgment to make up their own minds on whether they will vote? The Opposition seem to be saying that if members do not vote in the workplace, they cannot be relied upon to exercise their judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. It will be up to the unions to get across their message. The provision may ensure that the unions communicate more frequently with their members.<br><br>

The closed shop used to be one of the greatest evils of the trade union movement. The closed shop allowed members to be taken for granted. Postal ballots would not allow members to be taken for granted because they would have to be convinced of the need to register either a positive or a negative vote.<br><br>
I have heard nothing here this morning to make me change my view that the words, as drafted, should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There should be two guiding principles for any ballot. The first and most important principle is that the ballot should be secret. The second is that there should be as high a participation rate as possible. The clause does not affect that in any way. Therefore we consider that it is irrelevant and probably counterproductive.<br><br>
Labour Members of the Committee are not opposed in principle to postal ballots. We oppose the compulsory nature of their provision, but because we are not opposed in principle to postal ballots, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 20, in page 11, line 35, after 'other", insert "personal".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, this is a matter on which there is general agreement on both sides of the Committee. Details of salary and other major personal benefits of members of the trade union executive should be published and made known to the members of that union. We welcome the proposition that union members are entitled to know what has been done with their money and how much their elected executives are receiving.<br><br>
The question that we raise on the first amendment is why the law on disclosure for trade union executives should be more onerous than the law on disclosure for company directors. It is considerably more onerous. It is particularly strange in view of the fact that, generally speaking, the salaries and benefits accruing to company directors are considerably higher than those of most trade
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
union executives. Company directors' salaries are not subject to any special singular resolution at the company's annual meeting. The only way to prevent their salary increases is to throw out the whole report. The provisions are not specific. The law requires the company's annual report to specify how much the chairman of the company receives and the name of anyone who is paid more than the chairman, but information about what the other directors receive is given not by name but by band. The report sets out how many directors receive emoluments within a particular band. That is the reason why our amendment proposes the banding approach for trade unions.<br><br>
Our general belief is that company law should be as specific as the Government propose for trade union law, but until the Government see fit to change company law we believe that trade union law should stay in line with company law.<br><br>
We need to be convinced of the need for more specific information about trade union officials than about company directors. It is perhaps appropriate to refer to some of the company directors referred to in the Second Reading debate.<br><br>
A quick glance at the report on some of the companies which benefited from the proposed abolition of wages councils shows that the chairman of Allied Lyons is paid £247,000 per year. The top director's specified pay is £369,000 a year. The remaining £3 million a year is not specified and is accounted for in bands. The pay of the chairman of Trusthouse Forte is specified in the report as £237,105 a year. The top director's pay, which is higher than that of the chairman's, is £249,721 a year. However, it is impossible to find out how the remaining £3 million of directors' emolument is spread between the remaining 11 directors.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Whitbread's chairman is paid £169,304 a year. The best paid director gets £330,428 a year. But the report does not state how the remaining 10 directors split the remaining £1.5 million. Grand Metropolitan is more straighforward. The best paid director is the chairman—I hope that he is the best paid director because he gets £713,391 a year. Again, the annual report does not state how the remaining £3 million is spread between the remaining seven directors. That is a fair amount to be spread among them. The same applies to Scottish and Newcastle, the chairman gets paid £271,019 a year. We do not know how the reamining £1.4 million is spread among the 12 directors. If company directors' pay can be as vague as that and no provision is made for individual shareholders to vote on those emoluments separately from other issues—as would be the case with the salaries and benefits of trade union officials—we believe that what is good enough for the company goose is good enough for the trade union gander.<br><br>
Other aspects of the Bill would make trade union law more onerous than company law. In company law, emoluments do not include pension scheme arrangements but the Bill includes them in trade union emoluments. There are exemptions for small companies but there are no exemptions for small unions. There are even exemptions for directors who work mainly abroad, which is probably becoming even more important. In the past, disclosure was part of the price which company
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0380">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 61</span>
directors paid for the immense benefits of limited liability. Those benefits remain but there are no parallel benefits for trade union members and officials. Most of the legal protection which unions and their executives had has been taken away by the salami tactics of the preceding six trade union acts, introduced by Conservative Governments.<br><br>
The provision would be more onerous for trade union executives than the provisions pertaining to company directors, despite the fact that company directors are subject to less scrutiny and control by shareholders and have greater protection under common law. The provision would, therefore, be unfair.<br><br>
Other benefits referred to in amendment No. 22, which are covered by the word "personal" in amendment No. 20, raise the question about whether it is necessary in company law for a director to declare a chauffeur-driven company car, or even a company car.<br><br>
Our understanding is that the clause, as drafted, would require the trade union to declare the chauffeur driven car, or the car wholly or partly provided by the union, as being included in the benefits which the trade union executive member receives.<br><br>
Our amendment may not achieve the trick, but we would like to see that aspect taken out. Where a trade union executive member, president or general secretary have certain benefits which are necessary for them to carry out their work, they should not be specified in the information given to members unless that same information is given to the shareholders of a company. We distinguish between their normal working facilities and what we describe as a personal benefit. If, for some obscure and totally unjustified reason, a trade union provided a member of the executive with a house in Marbella, generally speaking that would be regarded as a personal benefit which ought to be declared, even if some help was sought from the union in recovering the occupancy of the house in Marbella. Perhaps that should be included in the benefits.<br><br>
The clause is far too onerous in comparison with the demands for declaration by company directors. If the Government want to go ahead with this particularly onerous requirement of declaration from the president, general secretary or executive members of a trade union, that is fine with us, but we expect small companies legislation to do the same for companies.<br><br>
Finally, despite all the assertions that are made about impropriety and fraud within trade unions, the Government never give any examples. The best that they can do is to wave a couple of press cuttings from a more squalid part of the Tory press, which usually turn out to be a total fallacy. Alternatively, they wave their own Green Paper, which we do not regard as holy writ even if the Minister does.<br><br>
The situation in the City and of company fraud throughout the country does not bear comparison. Clear fraud is carried out every day and the Government do nothing about it, in contrast to a few allegations which they attribute to trade unions but never prove. Anything to do with fiddling money is already against the law, and if people are fiddling, whether they are company directors or executives of trade unions, they should be prosecuted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked which reports I would draw his attention to and I suggest that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
he reads the Lightman report. Thanks to the steps that Mr. Lightman took, it was published—something which the National Union of Mineworkers was not happy to see happen.<br><br>
I was encouraged when the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras indicated on Second Reading that he would welcome
<br><blockquote><p>"new rules which are intended to … guarantee that members are sent full financial details of their union funds and of official's pay and perks".—[<i>Official Report,</i> 17 November 1992; Vol. 214, c. 188.]</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And I welcome that. The hon. Gentleman made points about company law. He will understand that I will not respond to them because I am dealing with a Bill that is actually before us.<br><br>
There are several considerable differences between companies and trade unions—workers may have to join the latter, whereas people make a choice about whether to be shareholders in a company and are sent details. We heard many facts and figures from the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, I cannot agree that companies are not open to public scrutiny.<br><br>
It is widely accepted that trade unions should, as a matter of course, provide information to the certification officer and to their members about the salary paid and benefits provided to their leaders. Those salaries and benefits come from subscriptions paid by union members and the leaders are subject to election to office by those members. It should no longer be necessary for members or, indeed, the public, to depend on information gleaned from details which union leaderships may choose to make available, when it pleases them so to do.<br><br>
Amendment No. 20 assumes that we are in agreement about the need to supply details of salary payments and benefits provided to the holders of specific union offices. I hope that the Opposition can agree that those details must be comprehensive. There would be little point in setting up arrangements which meant, for example, that a union could legitimately avoid detailing valuable benefits provided out of union funds to the holder of an office.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister define benefits?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall define benefits later, if the hon. Gentleman will be patient.<br><br>
There would be little point in setting up arrangements which meant that a union could legitimately avoid detailing valuable benefits provided out of union funds to the holder of an office, simply by adopting a device whereby it appeared as if the benefit was not nominally available to that person. That is exactly what the Opposition would achieve if amendment No. 20 were accepted and I find that difficult to reconcile with the remarks made by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras on Second Reading.<br><br>
To insert the word "personal", as proposed, would have a further, undesirable consequence. At present, the nature of the new requirement is clean a union must give details of all salary payments, expressed as a cash amount; and of all other benefits which could be expressed by a cash-equivalent figure, or by an adequate description of the benefit, if that is more appropriate or practicable.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where will the Minister draw the line in facilities made available to a member of a trade union executive, a president or a general secretary in helping them in their work? Will their car—most, but not all, may be supplied by the union and in a limited number of cases, with a driver— be included in the benefits? If so, will the provision of a secretary to type letters be included in the benefits? Will the office equipment be included? The trade union officer could say that those are being devoted to the interests of the members. Where does the Minister draw the line?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has no difficulty drawing the line for company perks and benefits—he keeps referring to them. There are cases in which information will have to be closely studied. I see no difficulty in that and no difficulty in fulfilling the requirement. It was interesting that the hon. Gentleman did not say that in his opening remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Companies Act 1985 draws the line by defining the limit. That is part of the difference. Would a trade union official's company car have to be declared under the provisions of the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I shall answer that point later. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Northfield must be patient—they are making the same point. Does the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras still want to intervene?</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has made my point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To limit the second of those elements to "personal" benefits could give rise to confusion about what constituted a personal benefit as opposed to a benefit that was part and parcel of the union office concerned. To introduce such potential for confusion is neither desirable nor necessary. Union members have a right to know how much pay and benefits are received from union funds by their leaders.<br><br>
I have explained what is covered by "benefits". If the Opposition share the Government's belief that unions should honestly and fairly identify the pay and benefits of their leaders, they should not object to the wording of new section 32(3)(aa) of the 1992 Act. If a union does its best to provide the information required, it will not risk incurring penalties to which it might otherwise be liable.<br><br>
The Opposition should not try to undermine the intended effects of the new requirement by proposing such an amendment, which, by creating an unnecessary and ambiguous loophole, would undoubtedly increase the scope for withholding important information. I do not, therefore, commend the amendment to the Committee, and I hope that my hon. Friends will reject it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister had been listening, he would know that I am always conscious of the imperfections of amendments that we propose. I am happy to take or, at least, to listen to advice from the Government, based on the draftsmanship that they can provide, that, in some way, better defines "benefits". The Minister still owes my hon. Friends the Members for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
Warley, West and for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and I a plain answer to a plain question: would the car provided by the union be regarded as a benefit under the Bill's provisions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is clearly yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: But not for a company director.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Terry Rooney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware of the widespread public perception that Members of Parliament are now paid £104,000 a year, because of a mysterious calculation which, for example, includes £9,000 for parking our cars downstairs. Does not he accept that it is right for union members to know the true pay and benefits of an executive member, a president or general secretary, but not the associated and, in some cases, frivolous costs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind last week's debate, I do not want to discuss benefits of Members of Parliament. It is important for me to qualify the answer that I just gave concerning the use of cars. I said "Yes". If the car were used for personal purposes or if it were to extend into personal use by the executive member, it would become a perk. If it were solely used in the execution of duty, the question may not arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the car is used for 80 per cent of the time for union purposes and 20 per cent for personal purposes, does the union official and the union have to declare 20 per cent of the value of the car's use?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is used for personal purposes, it is available for personal use and, therefore, it is a benefit. That is straightforward and unambiguous.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Consider a genuine official from a union such as the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, who travels thousands of miles around the north of Scotland. His car is a tool, not a benefit. It enables him to visit his members in that part of Scotland. Are we going to reach the stage where we regard a desk and telephone benefits?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not see how a desk could be for personal use but a telephone could. It depends what the hon. Gentleman has in mind regarding what might happen on the desk—but I do not want to inquire too far into what the hon. Gentleman means. I sense that there is a need to move forward. We have explained why we believe the amendment to be wrong and why we shall stand by clause 6 when it is debated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can we put it on record that a benefit would have to be declared if it were used purely for personal use?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making was that a car would be a specific item. A benefit relating to a pension would be a personal matter, from which the trade union official could gain. There are other similar benefits. That is why the clause should not be changed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that only 19 per cent of company directors have their pensions declared?<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 65</span>
The Minister has not explained why the requirement for a trade union is different from that for a company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the reasons why I have not gone into that is because the Bill deals with trade unions. Earlier in my speech I referred to what I think is the fundamental difference between a trade union and a company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Rooney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister said that if a trade union official had personal part use of a car, the full value should be declared. There would be a difference between what the Inland Revenue would class as the benefit of that car and what would be the benefit in the Bill. In the interests of consistency, perhaps the Minister should think again about what he said.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 21, in page 11, line 46, after "and", insert
<br><blockquote><p>", so far as it is reasonably practicable".</p></blockquote>
The duty to maintain a register and to have a statement of the number of names on that register and of those names which are not accompanied by an address, which is a member's address for the purposes of the provision, would be somewhat onerous. We understand its purpose and believe that unions should maintain up-to-date, accurate registers, but it would assist if, at this or a later stage, the Government were to accept amendment No. 21, or a similar provision. The duty seems to be absolute, with the result that one minor foul-up could render the union liable to all sorts of pains and penalties. I cannot believe that that was the Government's intention. In view of the singular inaccuracy of registers—the electoral register, for example—for which the Government are responsible, they should have some sympathy for those who maintain trade union registers, sometimes in difficult circumstances. Therefore, I hope that the Government will accept a slight waiver on what seems to be an absolute requirement in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman on the point that he raised.<br><br>
Faced with the prospect of providing the figures required by clause 6, unions will make a special effort to ensure that entries on their registers are indeed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
accompanied by proper postal addresses, but that is no more than is already required under section 24. Subsection 6(b) imposes no additional requirement or burden on unions beyond their existing statutory duty with regard to maintaining records of names and addresses that are accurate and up-to-date. I would add, however, that, if the clause provides an additional incentive for unions to comply with their existing statutory duty, that is most welcome.<br><br>
One final point of reassurance is that the figures required will do no more than serve as an indication of the state of the register of the union in question. If the figures supplied by a particular union show what appears to a member reading the report to be a high proportion of names without addresses, it will be open to that member to make a complaint to the court or to the certification officer that the union is not maintaining its register, as required by section 24. The court or certification officer will examine the evidence and will decide whether the union has complied with its statutory obligations, with due regard to the test of reasonable practicability that the Act stipulates.<br><br>
Nothing in subsection 6(b) alters that test. It provides that the certification officer must receive a numerical indication of the state of the union's register. As an opportunity for the provision of information to ordinary union members, and as an incentive for the proper maintenance of union registers, the provision deserves the support of both sides of the Committee, but I shall consider the points raised by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It turns out that our reasonably practicable amendment is unnecessary because that element is already included in the Bill. Therefore, subject to the assurance that the Minister has given to ensure that an absolute duty is not introduced, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[<i>Mr. Boswell</i>]</p>
<p>Bill to be further considered on Thursday next at half-past Ten o'clock—[<i>Mr. Boswell</i>]</p>
