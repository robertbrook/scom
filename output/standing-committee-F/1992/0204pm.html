<br><br><!-- lb --> Rights Bill</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 7</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>PAID HOLIDAY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>'Every employee shall have the right to 4 weeks paid holiday, on a pro rata basis. Pay shall be defined as in Schedule 14 to the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978.'.—[	<i>Mr. Galbraith.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seeks to give every employee a statutory entitlement to four weeks' holiday leave based on a pro rata calculation that depends on the number of hours worked. The four weeks would be for full-time employees. There is increasing concern among organisations about the number of people who are refused holiday entitlement, even though it is in their contract. They have no option of redress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom is the only EC country that does not have a general statutory right to holidays. The only employers who have a statutory right to allow holiday leave are those covered by the agricultural wages board. Since the Wages Act 1986, there has been no legislation that employees can rely on to give them paid or, indeed, unpaid holiday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two important reasons for holidays. First, it is doubtful whether any group of people could maintain their efficiency if they were to work for 52 weeks a year. Everyone agrees that holidays are necessary for anyone, anywhere, doing a job. To work continuously for 52 weeks a year is an inefficient and ineffective use of human resources. Secondly, if it were not paid holiday, many people would be under pressure to continue working because they would get no pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, we favour a statutory right, in line with other EC countries, to paid holiday entitlement. It should be based on a minimum of four weeks holiday for a full-time worker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the great majority of cases, annual holiday entitlement is already above the minimum proposed by the hon. Gentleman. In the minority of cases—fewer than 10 per cent.—where the proposed minimum would actually be above the existing level of entitlement, there are usually special features, such as the seasonal or casual nature of the work, which would make a four-week entitlement unnecessary or unworkable. These
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
circumstances are understood by both employers and employees and are taken account of in the overall terms and conditions of employment. I believe that once the adjustments implicit in the words "pro rata" were made, the actual effect of the amendment on holiday entitlements would be negligible. I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Gentleman might feel inclined to leave the matter where it properly resides—as something to be agreed between employers and employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But does not the Minister recognise that this causes great difficulty for people who have to do regular casual work? That might sound like a misnomer, but it happens. Those people are not covered by any holiday entitlement. I should have thought that any attempt to address that difficulty would be welcomed. As my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) said, no one can work 52 weeks a year without a break. Those people find themselves disfranchised. Unfortunately, there is a growing tendency to casualise work forces, instead of having them on the books on full pay as regular employees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the nature of the employment is casual, it is possible for the people concerned to ensure that they are their own masters in respect of the amount of time that they take off from work. The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden refers to a "pro rata" provision. I was not sure what that meant. I assumed that it meant that it should take account of the total hours or period being worked in relation to what would constitute full-time work. I think that the benefits would be limited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The administrative burden on business would be considerable. I am afraid that the burden on business is back with us in our deliberations. The amendment seems simple, but there would have to be more complex supplementary provisions to define the qualifying length of service, the meaning of holiday and the treatment of part-time workers—everything that is implied by those magic words "pro rata". To ensure that the employers were not exposed to vexatious claims and complaints, they would have to go to extra trouble and expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the introduction of the Wages Act 1986, in the days when wages councils fixed holiday entitlements, as many as half the complaints received were about disputes over the assessment and interpretation of holiday pay, even when the allowances were in fact above the minimum level of entitlement. I fear that the amendment would plant a thicket of complex and burdensome regulation across the whole field of employment. That would not be worker protectiion but bureaucratic meddling. I know from the frequent interventions that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden makes on behalf of the health service that he is totally opposed to bureaucratic meddling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even though the Government have increased that cost by £3 billion in the past year. At least the Minister has the decency to smile when once again he talks about burdens on business. We always come back to the fact that, when there is a conflict between the business man and the rights of individual workers, the Government side with the business man. The Minister also said that until 1986 most of the complaints about wages councils, which were able to set statutory minimum
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
wages, were about holidays. What he meant was that because that was a burden, they should get rid of wages councils; it was not a case of the employers being unjust or exploitative. Because employers had a problem, in that they were abusing their position and exploiting the workers, the Government decided that, rather than have the employers outside the law, they would change the law to bring them within it. If there is exploitation, to change the law to make that exploitation legal is a ludicrous solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are the only country in the EC with no statutory provision for holiday entitlement. The Minister says that such a provision would be difficult and complex. Our amendment does not deal, of course, with what "pro rata" might mean in relation to holidays. I accept that argument. It is the Government's job to draft legislation to deal with that matter. My goodness, if the Government can draft legislation on the poll tax, they can certainly draft legislation to cover holiday entitlement. Every other European country can do so. We are not satisfied by the Minister's response, therefore, although we enjoy him smiling every time he talks about burdens on employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the hon. Gentleman's case, which seems to rest upon our ability to draft effective legislation to implement the poll tax, is necessarily the best foundation upon which to choose to construct his argument. I say that with all the humility of someone who once wrote a pamphlet entitled "The Case for the Poll Tax". If the hon. Gentleman's complaint is that in this Committee my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I have always sided with the interests of business and never with the interests of workers, I have to tell him that some of the representations from the business sector have come to the Department during the Committee's proceedings, particularly those relating to the concessions on maternity provision made by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, do not accord with the hon. Gentleman's complaint. However, I am most grateful to him for those words, which I shall arrange to draw to the attention of the Confederation of British Industry and other bodies which do not share his view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tried to reach a balanced view. In this case, the balance of the argument lies with not accepting the new clause because the benefits that it would confer would be out of proportion to the burdens that would be placed on employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister sought to use the maternity provisions in the Bill to justify his assertion that he was not siding with the employers. That was a bad example. We know, from his contributions and those of Conservative Back Benchers, that those maternity provisions are included because of the European Community directive and against the will of the Government and the Ministers who introduced them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being less than generous. I was referring to complaints which have arisen after my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and I have been overwhelmed by the eloquence of Opposition Members and have agreed to changes which go beyond the terms of the directive. We have heard grumbles from business interests, who ask why we have gone beyond the terms of the directive. The answer is that the arguments and
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
justifications of the hon. Gentleman, and of others outside the Committee, were clear. The accusation that the Government always side with business is unfair. We are being shot at from all sides which, on previous experience, suggests that we have probably got it about right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we can probably draw the matter to a conclusion by agreeing that Opposition Members are extremely eloquent and have persuaded the Minister with the force of their arguments. That being the case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 10</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ANNUAL REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE OF INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNALS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"(). After section 128 of the 1978 Act the following shall be added:
	<br><blockquote><p>" 128A—(1) The Secretary of State shall carry out an annual review of the performance of the industrial tribunals in co-operation with the President of the Industrial Tribunals for England and Wales and his counterpart in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) The review shall cover the following matters—[	<i>Mr. Galbraith.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for me to go into great detail because we discussed the issue on Tuesday. The new clause is an attempt to have more cases dealt with by industrial tribunals. We have already discussed the problem that the increase in the number of cases will result in increased delay. In no region do we find that more than 50 per cent. of cases are heard within 12 weeks. The Government proposed speeding up proceedings by having chairmen sit alone. We discussed why we thought that was inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause sets out our proposals to try to speed up the number of cases heard at industrial tribunals. We think that the Government should carry out an annual review, set performance targets, find out why delays occur and, if necessary, provide more money, more staff or more chairmen. We are at one with the Government on this issue. The delays are unacceptable and action must be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, we discussed this issue the other day. It is important that we accept that the delays they have, unfortunately, built up in the system are regrettable. I was convinced by the examples given by my hon. Friends about how delays occur—lay members not being available to sit on consecutive days and cases being delayed for a long time. Although the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden opposed our proposal that chairmen should sit alone, I believe that that will speed up the system. We shall monitor what happens very carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Lord Chancellor has agreed that, for a limited period, part-time chairmen may sit for 70 days per year, instead of only 50, if they are still in practice, and for 100 days, instead of only 70, if they are retired from practice. There has been an expansion of the tribunal premises,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>735</span>
and efficiency measures have been introduced, but all that will inevitably take time to impact on delays in cases coming to hearing. That is despite the great effort made by all those concerned in the industrial tribunals in dealing with the unprecedented case-load. However, the situation is beginning to stabilise and I am confident that we shall soon see further improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I told the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden on Tuesday that I would consider the issues that he raised. I am reluctant to agree to publishing an annual review because I am not sure of what effective use that would be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were problems, the hon. Gentleman would have a number of courses open to him—as do other hon. Members—to facilitate that. I have said that I shall examine how we can incorporate special mentions of that matter in the annual report, which is presented by the Department to the House, with the Chief Secretary and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. That is a way forward that I am keen to investigate further. I think that we shall be able to make progress in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that concession and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<div class='clause'>New Clause 12</div> <!-- clause -->
	<div class='title'>COMPLAINT TO INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNAL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>"() In section 67 of the 1978 Act (Complaint to industrial tribunal), for subsection (2) there shall be substituted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Subject to subsection (4), an industrial tribunal shall not consider a complaint under this section unless it is presented to the tribunal before the end of the period of six months beginning with the effective date of termination or within such further period as the tribunal considers reasonable in a case where it is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable for the complaint to be presented before the end of the period of six months.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2A) Where there is an internal disciplinary appeal against the decision to terminate the applicant's employment, an industrial tribunal shall not consider a compliant under this section unless it is presented before the end of the period of six months beginning with the date the appeal decision is communicated to the applicant.".'. —[	<i>Mr. Galbraith.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This takes us back to the industrial tribunals, appeals, re-instatement and the amount of compensation. The new clause deals with the time barring of appeals. The current period of three months is fairly rigidly applied, especially when contrasted with the flexible three-year limit in personal injury case claims in the courts and the six-year limit in contractual claims. The new clause would extend the period to six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2A) aims to take into account internal disciplinary procedures. I am sure that everyone will agree that even if the best of internal disciplinary procedures are set in motion they may be exhausted before they reach an industrial tribunal. The process can take some time. The individuals often have to wait for that internal appeal to reach its conclusion and only then can they consider taking it to an industrial tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
We think that it is correct and proper that the time—barring should start only from the end of that appeal within the internal procedure. That would give flexibility to the industrial tribunals. We consider that this is not a dogmatic or an ideological issue, but a practical means of improving the justice and fairness of an industrial tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I understand the need for the new clause. I heard what the hon. Gentleman said about internal procedures. The fact that internal disciplinary procedures are going on does not prevent a complaint from being launched. If, as we discussed earlier in the Committee, there is a reason why an application has been delayed which arises from the circumstances of a particular case, that will be taken into account. The limit is not applied inflexibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three-month limit was not dreamt up by the Government; it was dreamt up by the previous Labour Government. It seems to be the right kind of balance. It is long established and it is difficult to understand the reasons for changing it. I am well aware that there have been many representations to that effect. The hon. Gentlemen may want to reflect on this and return to it at a later stage in the Bill, but it is difficult for me to see that there would be any benefits in making this change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong this debate, but I think that the Minister should be aware that there are several companies and employees' organisations that have expressed concerns, perhaps not publicly but in the process of consultations, about the effect of having to instigate tribunal proceedings, sometimes unnecessarily, during disciplinary proceedings that may resolve themselves to the satisfaction of both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that the parties, especially those companies that regularly engage lawyers—and I know the Minister's aversion to the use of lawyers in such matters—incur costs unnecessarily. In that context, perhaps the Minister will reflect on the comments made by my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would be happy to do that because the Committee has shown a considerable amount of good will. I fear that I may not please people who are not present by saying so but, without giving any commitment, I would be happy to consider any detailed representation that the hon. Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) might want to make as the Bill continues its passage through the House. I fear that I may not please people who are not present by saying that. I hope, on that basis, that the hon. Gentlemen will withdraw the new clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. There is a good basis for the new clause, not just because of what my hon. Friend said, but because the decision to go to an industrial tribunal prejudges the outcome of many internal disciplinary procedures, and prejudices many of those cases. For that reason, it is often not instituted. Individuals can find themselves time barred. On the Minister's assurance that he will consider representations, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are straightforward amendments. They seek to increase the time for keeping wages councils records. It is always an advantage, for many reasons, to retain information for as long as possible. That is useful, not just for historical purposes, but, in this case, for the rights of individuals The amendments would extend the time that the records would be kept from six months to 24 months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment, which would maintain the powers of the wages inspectors and obligations on employers to no real purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few civil cases are brought on behalf of employees by wages inspectors and it is extremely unlikely that there would be a need to start a case more than six months after the last of the events to which the case related had taken place. Additionally, because it would no longer be possible to institute new criminal proceedings for underpayment under part II of the Wages Act after six months, it would be odd for inspectors to be able to prosecute for the ancillary offence of failing to keep access to records open. I hope that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had 22 sittings and more than 55 hours of debate. I should like to pay tribute to the Committee's work in scrutinising the Bill, which has been changed significantly. One clause has been dropped and two Opposition amendments accepted, one of which I had to plead with the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras to move. We have also given about 20 commitments to bring forward amendments, which I hope will be tabled
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0780">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>739</span>
on Report and which will affect about half of the Bill's clauses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that Committees be used constructively and I hope that Opposition Members will not be embarrassed if I say how much I have enjoyed the spirit of this Committee. Proceedings have been infiltrated from time to time by unwelcome intruders such as the vexatious litigant, the creepy-crawly, the neo-classical liberal and the golden thread. There has been no home in the Committee for that more disruptive influence, the vexatious population—sorry, politician;—Freudian slip.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had our differences, some of which have run deep, but the way in which the hon Members for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) and their colleagues have put their arguments has been much appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have benefited, as has my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, from the advice of my hon Friends. I was sorely tempted on occasion to accept the advice of my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls), and Opposition Members were relieved that I did not. I hope that the spirit of co-operation, reasonableness and healthy debate will accompany the Bill for the remainder of its passage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I am sure that that good spirit derived from your admirable chairmanship, Mr. Knox, which we have all enjoyed. You have borne a heavy load with patience. The untimely and unfortunate illness of Mr. Hogg put you at our mercy more than I suspect you might have wished. With a little help from my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Sir M. Neubert), you have guided our proceedings with calm authority. We have all benefited from your experience and good sense, although those of us who are arrant pupils took some time to learn the lessons of parliamentary propriety. I am sure I speak for the whole Committee in wishing Mr. Hogg a speedy recovery.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to thank 	<i>Hansard,</i> the police, the Clerk and the Officers of the House. I should also like to thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Mr. Wood) and his opposite number, the hon. Member for Warley, West (Mr. Spellar), who have conducted our business splendidly. Finally, I should like to thank my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, who, characteristically, has taken a robust and aggressive stand—the position that I have usually been accused of taking by Opposition Members in the press. I very much look forward to the further stages of the Bill and am most grateful to all members of the Committee for allowing the Bill to leave the Committee much improved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Knox. May I first apologise for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras who unfortunately, seems to have become the first victim of workfare—a subject with which he has spent most of today trying to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also associate myself with the Minister's kind words for yourself, Mr. Knox, and for the staff of 	<i>Hansard,</i> the Clerks and all Committee members. It has been a pleasant experience and a pleasant change. The Minister
	<span class='label label-info column'>740</span>
and I last met in Committee when we considered a Scottish education Bill and the occasion is ingrained on our memories. We spent several months in a Committee Room in trench warfare staying up all through the night arguing about changing "shall" to "will" and "maybe" and, at the end of the three months, the Bill emerged almost completely unaltered. The purpose of that Bill was to allow schools in Scotland to opt out. It is worthy of note that, despite our three months in Committee, not one school in Scotland has ever felt the need to make use of the Bill's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been striving hard for years to find one. There was a chance at one time that a school in Orkney might have opted out, but it decided not to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a pleasant experience to serve on the Committee. We have dealt with the business reasonably well. We have sought to argue our case and the Minister, much to no one's surprise, has not always seen our point of view. I am grateful to all my hon. Friends who have supported those of us on the Opposition Front Bench and I am grateful to all those Conservative Members who thought about supporting us on one or two issues, but who, at the last minute, for reasons that shall remain secret to them, decided that they could not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, may I also send my best wishes to your co-Chairman, Mr. Knox? Mr. Hogg is the string that runs through the Committees on which the Minister and I sit as he chairs the education Bills that relate to Scotland. I am sure that we all wish him well. Thank you, Mr. Knox, on behalf of my colleagues. I, too, look forward to the continuation of the Bill's passage through the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I thank the Minister and the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden very much for their kind remarks about myself and Mr. Hogg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, perhaps, tell members of the Committee that Mr. Hogg is feeling better although he is still weak. He was thinking of returning next Monday. My advice to him—perhaps the Whip will shut his ears for a moment—was not to return until he was fully fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am conscious of what the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has been doing today. I woke up this morning and heard his voice on my radio. I am not at my best first thing in the morning and I thought, for one awful minute, that I was in Committee. I am reminded of the member of the House of Lords who dreamt that he was making a speech in the House of Lords and woke up to find that he was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a pleasure to chair the Committee. We have dealt with controversial issues, but in good spirit, which shows that civilised debate about controversial issues is possible. The Committee has been a good advert for the House of Commons and its Committees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister of State and the Under-Secretary of State for their courtesy and help; the hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras, for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and for Gateshead, East; the Whips; and all the members of the Committee who have made my task fairly easy.

Next week, I shall be dealing with the problems of the Railways Bill, so it may well be that I think of this Committee with nostalgia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I thank the Clerk for his invaluable help. We are all indebted to him—our proceedings would not
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
happen but for his work. I also thank the 	<i>Hansard</i> staff, the police and the Officers of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
