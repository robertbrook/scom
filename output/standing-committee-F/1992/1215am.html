	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to clause 14, which requires all ballots on industrial action to be full postal ballots. They are probing amendments, which suggest alternatives. Whatever the merits of compulsory full postal ballots for union executive elections or for mergers, for example, the Opposition do not believe that the same arguments apply to ballots on industrial disputes. More of that anon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments apply to ballots to decide whether to go ahead with industrial action that involves relatively few people. One can argue for compulsory postal ballots in union elections, which involve a large membership at several sites between whom there might be inconsistency, but the majority of ballots for industrial action involve 50 or fewer workers. The case has not been made for a full postal ballot in the case of, for example, 43 workers
	<span class='label label-info column'>196</span>
in a small engineering works. In a ballot involving fewer than 50 workers on one site, it would be more convenient, expeditious and fair to have a secret ballot at the workplace. That would probably also result in a better turnout. That is what has happened to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most workers in most circumstances support the idea that the higher the turnout the better the election. Indeed, hon. Members who are elected to Parliament in a general election or by-election crow if the turnout is high. I am especially aware of that, because my constituency, which contains a great many students and nurses, has one of the lowest turnouts in Britain, although the turnout among those who reside permanently in my constituency is not low.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Robert Spink 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the hon. Gentleman possibly claim that it would be fairer to deny workers the right to a postal ballot? If a worker happens to be sick, a postal ballot would enable him to take part in the election and vote. Surely that is fairer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had bothered to read the amendment, he would know that it does not prevent the union from carrying out a full postal ballot if it so wishes, or from offering a postal ballot to members who are sick or unable to attend the voting place. The logic behind the hon. Gentleman's argument is that everyone should have a postal vote in general elections because, under the present rules, some people fall sick too late in the electoral process and are not entitled to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise that a postal vote is neither fairer nor unfairer; it is a different method of obtaining the same degree of fairness. Generally speaking, most people subscribe to the view that the higher the turnout in an election the better the election, the more representative that election and, to some extent, the greater the authority to those who benefit from the decisions made in the election. Conservative Ministers have tried to claim greater authority over local authorities because the turnout is always higher in general elections than in local authority elections. Therefore, even Conservative Members argue in favour of high turnout.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments suggest that there should be a threshold figure of 30 or, preferably, 50 members taking part in the ballot, below which figure it would not be compulsory for the union to conduct a postal ballot. The general principles of postal balloting will be discussed during the debate on the next group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments concern thresholds which trigger the need for a postal ballot. At least until very recently, the Conservative party accepted that concept. In the Green Paper which was presented for consultation before the Bill was introduced, the Government contemplated a threshold figure of 50 members. If there is to be compulsory postal balloting for large industrial disputes, we think that it would be better to maintain that threshold of 50 or, at worst, to have a threshold of 30 before the requirement for a full postal ballot is triggered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best step now is to give the Minister the opportunity to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining his feelings. I am at a loss to know why we should differentiate between figures,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0458">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>197</span>
or why the hon. Gentleman feels that a company which employs 29 people or 49 people—dependent on which amendment, if any, we accept—would not be required to hold a postal ballot and that a company which employs 31 or 51 people would. I do not understand the logic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's comments about turnout. He went on record as saying that his constituency had one of the lowest turnouts. I am not sure whether he is arguing that because there was a low turnout, his constituency is not well-represented. I am sure that he did not intend to imply that. My constituency has one of the highest turnouts, solely because it has a good party organisation, which wants to support its local Member of Parliament. I am grateful for that. Perhaps the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) does not have the pulling power, or such a good organisation. I am not sure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot accept the amendment. In column 166 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of Thursday 10 December 1992, the hon. Gentleman said that he believed that manifesto commitments were important and should not be underestimated. I remind him that in the manifesto on which we fought the election it was stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will legislate to require that all pre-strike ballots are postal and subject to independent scrutiny, and that at least seven days' notice is given after a ballot."</p></blockquote>
I am right to stress the hon. Gentleman's comments in a previous sitting of the Committee about the importance he attached to manifesto commitments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister swap the commitment that he is not keeping for the one that he is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are always prepared to listen to reason. When there is a good argument for changing particular proposals, that is what we do. I should have thought that that would have been welcomed by the hon. Gentleman. In this case, however, the arguments do not persuade me that it would be right to include threshold figures. Therefore, for the sake of consistency and clarity, I ask my hon. Friends to oppose the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the circumstances, I do not want to say any more. However, we should like to vote on amendment No. 85.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments concern the principle of whether unions should have no legal alternative other than to conduct full postal ballots over industrial disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to be obsessed with postal ballots for trade unions, but they are not too obsessed with them at general elections. Full postal ballots may be justified for the election of senior union officers and union executives, or on the issue of trade union mergers, because those can involve vast numbers of people on various sites. A requirement of a fair election is that all electors are treated equally. It could be argued that there might be an element of inequality of treatment in such circumstances if there were not a full postal ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has to be recognised, however, that most full postal ballots have a lower turnout than other methods. To some extent, the level of turnout either endorses or undermines the authority of those who receive that authority from the ballot. I had the privilege of attending a conference in the autumn to celebrate 200 years of representative Government in Quebec, at which the former United Nations Secretary-General, looking south, questioned whether a country which did not manage a 50 per cent turnout in its presidential election could call itself a democracy. I do not want to raise that issue, and I do not entirely accept that view, but the basis of democracy is that the voters give the candidates authority by voting for them. The candidates do not have authority without those votes. If, at any level, the majority of the voters give a person or a decision authority, that authority is given, no matter what the turnout—unless there is a threshold. The Conservative party set a threshold in the referenda for Scotland and Wales in earlier Parliaments. In general, however, the greater the support, the greater the authority for that person or that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0459">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>199</span>
In case I did not make this clear to the hon. Member for Derbyshire, West (Mr. McLoughlin), the turnout in my constituency and in other inner-city constituencies tends to be low because there are many voters who are not in the area all the time. For example, nurses or students who are on the electoral register might be far away by the time that there is an election. In those constituencies, the turnout of the permanent voters is as high as, or even higher than in most other constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating not union elections or union mergers but strike ballots. Most strike ballots involve a small number of people. The vast majority of strike ballots carried out by the former Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunciations and Plumbing Union in the past few years involved fewer than 40 individuals. In larger ballots, the problem of turnout is one of the major arguments against using postal ballots. However, there are other arguments. In the Green Paper which preceded the Bill, the Conservatives acknowledged that a threshold of 50 was reasonable. The Green Paper which preceded the Employment Act 1988 concluded that
	<br><blockquote><p>"postal balloting could be unsuitable for ballots on industrial action where the issue may be of immediate concern to a relatively small proportion of a union's membership and speed of decision making is essential."</p></blockquote>
In response to the most recent Green Paper the Institute of Personnel Management said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Workplace ballots on industrial action normally have a high participation rate."</p></blockquote>
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a difficulty with postal ballots is the length of time they take in the context of strike action actually being called."</p></blockquote>
The Government's 1991 code of practice on industrial action ballots made it clear that secret workplace ballots are particularly suitable where
	<br><blockquote><p>"speed of obtaining the voters' response is of the essence."</p></blockquote>
The Engineering Employers' Federation stated
	<br><blockquote><p>"our experience is that provided they are properly conducted, secret workplace ballots are not subject to harassment and have additional beneficial features. EEFs experience is that workplace secret ballots have a significantly higher level of return than postal ballots. Postal ballots take at a minimum several days, often longer, whilst in many cases the momentum of negotiations will benefit from a quick decision as is available from workplace ballots.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The EEF believe, for the reason stated above, that properly conducted, secret workplace ballots can be the most effective form of balloting."</p></blockquote>
None of those organisations could be described as an adjunct of the Labour party; they are usually on the other side of the negotiating table from trade unions. Their day-to-day practical knowledge—not perhaps illuminated by the outpourings of the Adam Smith Institute—is that properly conducted workplace ballots work reasonably well. I have given a good range of views from people with experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party's justification for postal ballots is fear of intimidation and breakdown of ballot secrecy, but there is little evidence of that. The Commissioner for the Rights of Trade Union Members—CROTUM—produced four annual reports which gave details of 959 inquiries, 137 formal applications for assistance and eight queries on strike ballots. Of those eight queries, assistance was refused in three cases due to lack of prima facie evidence of anything being wrong, the applicant withdrew in one case, the High Court rejected one case, two complaints fell because the industrial action complained
	<span class='label label-info column'>200</span>
of did not take place, and one case succeeded in the High Court. Of the 1,000 complaints made to CROTUM in four years, only one on strike ballots was successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have emphasised the presence of CROTUM and have said that many people in the trade unions are worried about this, that or the other. There has been no lack of publicity about the ability to go CROTUM to complain and to obtain support and help but despite all the publicity, only eight queries were submitted on strike ballots, one of which turned out to be right. Just one query has gone through the machinery laid down by the Conservatives for dealing with complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of that query, the law is to be changed again. That seems to me to be an insubstantial evidential base, as lawyers might say, for proceeding with a substantial change in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many Conservative Members are concerned not with improper influence over ballots but with wholly proper influence over ballots. There is no reason why people who work with each other should not influence each other. Workers get together to strengthen their relationship to their employer. Generally the individual employee is weak in relation to the employer. People take collective action and adopt a collective approach because they face the power of a limited liability company, which is a collective organisation. Limited liability enables people to get together and risk only a little of their savings. The collective approach of the trade unions is a collective response to the collective power of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individuals are right to try to influence the votes of their colleagues in the workplace. It is clear from any study of electoral performance or response in this country that the views of people living in an area influence the voting behaviour of others in that area. My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) is not present at the moment, but I am sure that he would agree that, because of the influence of the Labour party in Scotland, more middle-class people in Scotland vote Labour than in south-east England. People are affected by the general ambience in which they live and cast their votes accordingly. Perhaps the Minister of State has some other explanation for the Scottish example, apart from the eminent good sense of the Scots. In elections, people can be perfectly legitimately influenced in the way in which they vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservatives are also motivated by their need to make industrial action more and more difficult to be carried out within the law. Few people want to have many strikes. Most people want to get on with their job. The loss to the economy, which results from strikes, can, however, be exaggerated. Since 1979, in the worst year of Conservative Government, 24 million working days were lost through strikes. In the worst year of the previous Labour Government, 29 million working days were lost in one year through strike action. This week, as a result of unemployment, 20 million working days will be lost through unemployment. That figure compares with 29 million days in one year, as a result of industrial disputes. Those figures need to be looked at in perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spirit, if not the letter, the proposals would seem to break International Labour Organisation conventions. As the Government do not seem to give a damn about the letter, I suppose that that does not matter, anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under International Labour Organisation conventions, free trade unions are supposed to have full
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0460">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>201</span>
freedom to operate. That does not mean that compulsory postal ballots are contrary to ILO conventions, but for the Government knowingly to impose a method of balloting which knowingly results in a lower turnout could be interpreted as undermining the trade unions' full freedom to operate as free trade unions. We would argue that the Government are trying, by statute, to produce a lower turnout because they know that the odds are that there will be a lower turnout in most cases.

Books about how to organise free elections have shown, from time immemorial—or at least since people have had the vote, which is far from time immemorial and, usually, Tories have opposed people having the vote—that those who try to reduce the turnout have usually been trying to work some fiddle to their advantage. We are faced with gerrymander by statute. Governor Gerry did nothing unlawful; he carried out a lawful fiddle in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided that ballots are properly conducted, there is merit in holding them at the workplace. They provide for the expeditious conduct of industrial relations and produce a higher turnout. I think that I have demonstrated beyond any challenge from CROTUM's record that there is no evidence of widespread manipulation, or fiddling of ballots at the workplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ballot at the workplace requires the use of the method by which we were all elected. Employees are given the ballot paper to which they are entitled, they mark that paper in private, they fold it up and place it in a ballot box, without anyone else knowing what they have done. That system was good enough to elect all of us, so to claim that it is unsatisfactory for an industrial action ballot is absurd.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People around the world have died—and would die—to be able to elect representatives as we are elected and to be able to vote as trade union members do in workplace ballots. There is nothing improper about a workplace ballot. In the past, there were a few workplace ballots that were not properly conducted, but these days they are properly conducted and are not invalidated by snide and and unsubstantiated attacks upon them. In the absence of a litany of proved cases of intimidation or lack of secrecy, the Government cannot justify the legislation. They cannot prove the need for postal ballots when all they can drum up is one case in four years from CROTUM and two or three snotty headlines in 	<i>The Sun.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that secret ballots need to be fully postal. We believe that the option of a postal ballot or of a partially-postal ballot should be available for members who are sick or unable to attend, or who do not have a normal workplace because they move around the country. Those circumstances are coped with. That practice should continue, but the requirement for a fully postal ballot is not sound when it comes to the conduct of industrial relations. It will lead to a lower and less representative turnout. That is why we do not support the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time, Ministers have said that, in matters of industrial relations, they are farsighted and claim to be able to see further ahead than those involved in the day-to-day practice of negotiations at the workplace. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>202</span>
right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) has said that most frequently. He played a large part in farsightedly introducing the poll tax. He now advocates the merits of the council tax, which may slightly invalidate his point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw attention to a group of people for whom the opportunity of the postal ballot is not only necessary, particularly with regard to strike action, but who must also be given adequate time. I refer to a letter from The Chamber of Shipping which points out that although at any one time there will be many seafarers at sea, there will be others who will be shore-based—either on sick leave, training courses or extended leave. It makes the point that it would be quite unfair for the people at sea if they did not receive the ballot papers in sufficient time for them to have their secret ballot and for their vote to be recorded on time. It indicated that this has been the nature of previous ballots for seafarers. The people whose votes have been returned on time have been those who are shore-based—who, as The Chamber of Shipping put it, could vote
	<br><blockquote><p>"for industrial action to be taken on their behalf by their colleagues at sea".</p></blockquote>
They may then be called upon to participate in a mandated strike at the next port.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Lady accept that a ship could also be a workplace and that union members on board could vote on that ship instead of in a postal ballot? A ballot should be conducted in the shortest possible time. The ship would be the workplace and the ballot could be held on board the ship. However, the legislation does not permit that to happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put forward that view because of the way in which industrial action within the seafaring community has developed. It shows that it is the few who vote for action, which is then taken by people who are at sea when the ballot takes place. The hon. Gentleman makes the point that the vote could take place on board. That should be welcomed. I ask the Minister to take into account that such a vote must be secret, that there should be a ballot paper and that sufficient time must be given for the votes to be returned. It is as important as the votes cast by shore-based people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to support the views expressed by my hon. Friend, the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras when he moved the amendment. A workplace ballot should determine whether any industrial action should be taken. Many people set much store by workplace ballots, and full turnout and participation in those ballots. We should all strive for the participation of most trade union members in a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the practical difficulties is that each workplace ballot must be conducted separately by each union. The results of each ballot are then added together so that a decision can be reached, in either a workplace or a postal ballot, in which different unions decide to take different action on the same issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Workplace ballots are brought to a speedy conclusion because they usually take place over 12 to 24 hours and everyone is given the opportunity to cast their vote. I envisage grave practical difficulties if different unions use
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0461">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>203</span>
different administrative systems. For that reason alone, the amendment is worthy of consideration. I have taken part in many workplace ballots and have seen intimidation in none of them. Members want to be able to participate and to vote in secret. There has been no difficulty with that in the past and there is no reason to change the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner), I have taken part in many workplace ballots. I have seen how they are conducted and I support them as a way of taking decisions on industrial action. I saw no problems in any of those ballots. I agree with my hon. Friend that the main problem in conducting workplace ballots is the requirement on each organisation that is part of a collective agreement to conduct a separate ballot, to add the votes together and check that no organisation is out of line with the others. That is nonsense and it deprives people of taking part in a democratic decision. There is no doubt that, however the business is conducted—some unions have worked hard to make postal ballots work as well as possible—the turnout on postal ballots will be a third of that which can be achieved in workplace ballots. No one wants to deprive people who are away from work on a particular day of the opportunity to participate in making a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are easy methods of ensuring that that does not happen. The ballot can be advertised and made known to the work force by management or the union; facilities can be provided to ensure that people can participate. In most workplace ballots with facilities for people who are absent, it is possible to ensure at least 90 per cent participation. Furthermore, it is not difficult to ensure that there are no allegations of intimidation or wrongdoing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some years ago, I discovered that managements were trying to make certain that no such allegations could be made. The reaction of trade union organisations at plant level was to welcome help from management and to ensure that management could not allege unfairness. In that way, managements have been welcomed into the process of scrutinising the ballot—not just to ensure that ballot boxes are placed in suitable locations and that the secret ballot is secret, but to scrutinise the vote. Managements want to know that the decisions made by their employees are authoritative decisions made by a high proportion of the union members. That is not difficult and, indeed, it happens widely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A postal ballot would impose burdensome administration on trade unions and no company wants protracted negotiations. The last thing that an employer involved in annual or bi-annual wage rounds wants is for those issues to go on for an unreasonable length of time. The employer wants matters over with and settled so that employees, knowing what their salary will be, can go back to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, there could often be two or more postal ballots which could protract negotiations for an unreasonable length of time. But a workplace ballot, properly conducted, ensures that a decision is made in a relatively short time. That decision is authoritative and avoids the rumbling after-effects that could happen with
	<span class='label label-info column'>204</span>
a postal vote which would be to the detriment of all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I experienced a management that used an argument which we have heard in the House in support of proportional representation. When the decision was not what the employer wanted—there was a clear majority for industrial action—the employer said that because not everyone had voted, the majority was not of 100 per cent of the work force. That problem could be minimised by giving good facilities in the workplace to ensure that there would be the maximum turnout which would give the most authoritative decision possible. Anyone who is a democrat should support that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras explained, we are advocating a system which is almost a replica of what sends us here. A postal vote is available when it is justified and ballot boxes are placed as conveniently as is economically possible. In the workplace, that system would be better because ballot boxes could be placed nearer to people and turnout, in such cases, is often higher than in a general election. If we are democrats and are interested in people making democratic decisions, that is the type of method which we would encourage. We would not encourage a method that has been tried and tested and which has proved to be unable to deliver much more than a 35 per cent turnout no matter what effort is put into it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The news which leaked out last week about the Government's funding plans for trade union ballots confirmed our view that the Bill is not about extending democracy. Clause 14 would impose a requirement to undertake postal ballots. We are not debating whether ballots are a good idea or are a preferable mechanism for voting. Many Opposition Members have, for many years, been involved in trade unions balloting members on industrial action. The ballots which have been conducted enhance democracy and are an attempt to ensure that decisions are representative. They ensure that a decision is effective because it has the support of the majority of the work force. If that were not so, the action should not be taken. That is why ballots have been undertaken by and supported by unions. It is also easier to ensure through workplace ballots that democracy has worked fairly. I shall give an example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a postal ballot is undertaken inappropriately, there may be disputes and disagreements on whether specific members received their ballot papers through the post. There is no way of ensuring that every member receives a ballot paper, other than by sending them out by recorded delivery—Conservative Members may want to expend yet more union funds on that. A workplace ballot is easier to administer. It is similar, as my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said, to the way in which we were elected to the House. Each voter receives a ballot paper and that is recorded, so there can be no dispute or argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances of some work forces mean that postal ballots are preferable, but in other circumstances that is not so. The hon. Member for Tiverton (Mrs. Browning) hit on that, perhaps inadvertently, in her analogy of seafarers on ships. A workplace ballot may be more democratic and fair and offer more chance to participate than a postal ballot, which is subject to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0462">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>205</span>
vagaries of the postal system. There is an added dimension if someone is away at sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to impose a prescription irrespective of local circumstances or the circumstances of employees and employers. I am not convinced that the motivation for the clause relates to a desire to extend democracy. The requirement for check-off will restrict the amount of union income and the requirement for postal ballots and the whipping away of funding for ballots will ensure that unions spend as much as possible from that lower income. If that is not the motivation for the provision, why will not the Government listen, if not to what we say, at least to employers? My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras referred to submissions from the Institute of Personnel Management and the Engineering Employers Federation. They made it clear that workplace ballots often provide a more representative decision and greater democracy and they are happy for them to take place. They are also aware of the higher participation rate in workplace ballots. Those opinions as well as those of Opposition Members, are not subjective. There is ample evidence from union elections since the requirement for postal ballots was imposed of a dramatic fall in the rate of participation. We have quoted the figures often in the Committee and I hope that the Government will take note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another argument against inappropriate postal ballots is timing. Anyone who has tried to promote and maintain industrial relations in the workplace knows that timing is important. The idea that a long drawn-out process will be in the interests of the union, the employees or the employers is crazy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Workplace ballots can enhance democracy and can be quickly conducted. When there is the possibility of a dispute, it is important for employees to find out quickly what will happen. I would argue, and I think that responsible employers would agree with me, that it is important that employees know the views of their work force quickly and efficiently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When wrapped up together with the notice of strike action, which we shall discuss later, the provisions are likely to mean that when a quick decision is needed, it could be dragged out by up to a month. Will that help negotiations? Will it help to diffuse the situation? I believe that, on many occasions, unions will feel obliged to process ballots earlier so that positions are entrenched earlier. The provisions will not ensure stable industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will be the impact on employers? Responsible employers do not want the clause, as drafted, to remain in the Bill. Vindictive or irresponsible employers may not agree with them. A ballot is a decision made by employees for employees about what they want to do. The imposition of this provision will drag out the process and mean that the democracy of a union and the opportunity for members to discuss the issues could easily be interferred with. There could be threats and intimidation. The ballot could be dragged out in a way that may be in the interests of the irresponsible employer, but not in the interests of industrial relations nor the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it strange that Conservative members of the Committee seem to support clauses to guard against trade union abuses, even though they have not been able to produce a shred of evidence that such abuses exist. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>206</span>
seem to think that irresponsible trade union shop stewards, executives and members all over the country are desperate to get out and fiddle books, accounts, ballots and elections. No evidence of such abuses has ever been produced. No regard is paid to the fact that on occasion there are irresponsible, vindictive employers who do not want to resolve disputes but want to prolong them. Those of us who have been involved in trade unions and industrial relations know that such employers exist. The clause, however, will add power to their elbow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence that we have heard suggests that workplace ballots often increase democracy and participation. If we want to promote good industrial relations, the amount of time allowed for the ballot, how it is conducted, the reality of the workplace and the relationship between employer and employee, should all be taken into account. We should not impose legislation on unions and employers that would decrease democracy and participation and, often, deepen industrial disputes and make them more entrenched, rather than avoid them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am trying to spot which part of the past decade's legislation will be tightened, repealed or replaced with something worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem to have new legislation every two years, whether industrial relations are calm or awful. The unwritten law, which is that we have to legislate every couple of years, seems to be a new and permanent feature of our constitution. The legislation bears no relation to what is going on in the outside world of industrial relations, but seems to be a continuous attempt to stifle and suppress the efficient operation of free trade unions in this country. If that legislation had been imposed on Solidarity in communist Poland, or on any of the other brave trade unions that led to the end of such regimes, it would have been denounced by the Government as an outrageous infringement of liberty and something to be opposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering clause 14 and the amendments to it that have been tabled, we wend our way back to the subject of postal balloting. We discussed this in relation to a previous clause. Once again, we are considering a clause that is draconian and inflexible, in that it imposes postal ballots on all elections, in all circumstances and on all trade unions.

We are dealing with a variety of different traditions, circumstances, structures of employment and work forces. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for her clarification, but her point about a particular work force with a particular structure does not lend itself easily as a solution for internal democratic procedures, upon which one monolithic solution will be imposed by statute. Traditionally, work forces have developed their own internal democracy and have produced systems that best suit their structures. Now that the legislation dictates what must be done in all circumstances and in different sorts of elections, that flexibility has been lost. It is odd that although we exhort the work force to be flexible in its working arrangements, the laws that the Government want to impose on the institutions that represent those work forces are inflexible. They are voluntary institutions, freely joined by individuals. The rules and regulations of other voluntary institutions are so hidebound by law. In fact, the law does not have much to say on the internal democracy of any other voluntary organisation. Far more odd goings-on take place in charities, leading to sudden bursts of controversy, usually at their annual general meetings and often involving the peculiar use of proxy votes of a dubious nature, than in trade unions, because of the open and democratic way in which the vast majority of trade unions and their members conduct themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend, the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) made a comment about the Conservative party. It is odd that, in choosing their leader, the Conservative party decided only very recently that an election was worth while.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that how any political party elects its leader is very interesting, but it is not covered by any of the provisions of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely trying to point out that the Government are imposing monolithic solutions on another organisation which they may consider to be their political enemy. We must bear in mind that the Government may have a vested interest. The current Father of the House was the first member of that political party ever to have been elected for the leadership by any process as modern and democratic as a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14 provides for compulsory postal ballots. My hon. Friends have discussed at length, and with great accuracy, some of the problems that we envisage will arise from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be the problem of low turnout. It might be that, with much effort, turnout could be increased. I hope that that is the case, but it is far more difficult to maintain people's enthusiasm and to remind them to fill in the ballot paper in a postal ballot. Many a postal vote has been lost because someone is too busy at home, because it arrives too late, or because it is lost in the post. There are greater barriers to using a postal vote than there are to walking into a secure place and casting a vote in a secret ballot—I emphasise the word "secret" because that is important in avoiding intimidation—by putting a cross on a piece of paper in the workplace. What is wrong with that? As my hon. Friends said earlier, that is how all hon. Members were elected at the general election. Surely the method used in a general election is equally veracious and accepable for trade union ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also worried about the inflexibility of postal ballots; they take time to organise and the result is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>208</span>
long time coming. Clause 14 would impose cumbersome procedures, sometimes out of all proportion to the circumstances. Industrial relations problems are of varying seriousness: some can be solved quickly; some are fundamental; some involve a few members of the work force who could perhaps be persuaded by a talented and committed shop steward or full-time trade union official to drop their complaint—perhaps they could negotiate with the management. Clause 14 provides the option of pressing the disputes button, which is different from some of the more informal negotiated settlements that might arise if there were no provision for a sudden postal ballot, by law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with my hon. Friends that the sheer time that postal votes can take to organise means that the resort to the ballot may happen earlier, thereby harming the negotiating process and worsening the problem instead of resolving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are contradicting themselves in their sudden, if not unpredictable, conversion to postal ballots in every circumstance. In the Green Paper which preceded the Employment Act 1988, the Government admitted that, in some circumstances, workplace ballots were acceptable. Will the Minister tell me what on earth has happended in the intervening four years to render that judgement null and void?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The code of conduct on postal balloting which was produced by the Department of Employment was quite the most extraordinary document. It suggested that the "yes" vote must be 80 per cent to authorise a strike. That figure is greater than the thresholds that were imposed on the devolution referendum in the 1970s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first read that document, I thought that it did a pretty thorough job of laying the ground to prevent a "yes" vote in every circumstance. The document stated that workplace ballots were appropriate on certain cases. The hon. Member for Tiverton demonstrated that there are circumstances in which that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with a problem of myth and reality. The Conservative party believes in myths about how trade unions behave. It rarely lets reality get in the way, and it continues to cling to those myths. One of those myths is that if balloting were compulsory for strikes, there would be lots of "no" votes. In fact the opposite has happened. Any trade union official could confirm that. There have been a few examples of a trade union embarking, irresponsibly, on industrial action without knowing whether it has the support of its members, but since the introduction of balloting, 95 per cent of strike ballots have resulted in a "yes" vote. The Government's belief that, if only there were a vote there would be no strike, is a myth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not underestimate the cost of postal balloting. That is relevant to last Thursday's announcement. Trade unions, because they are democratic and take many of their decisions by balloting their members, have to spend a great amount of money. The changes to the law since the early 1980s have imposed compulsory balloting in areas that previously would have been handled more informally. Rather than there being independent scrutiny by someone who had nothing to do with the union, ballots were scrutinised by someone who might have been associated with the union but who, nevertheless, did a good job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have a web of law and requirements that have been imposed on trade unions without consultation or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0464">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>209</span>
agreement. They dictate that ballots should be conducted in a specified way. Last Thursday's announcement confirmed that the money made available by the Government to fund balloting since the first trade union Act will be withdrawn within three years. Last year, the Trades Union Congress estimated that £4,082,382.75 was reimbursed to trade unions by the certification officer to cover the cost of ballots. That amount demonstrates how many ballots have taken place. Balloting is deeply ingrained in the trade union movement. Ballots would have taken place one way or the other, with or without current legislation. Trade unions have always spent much time balloting for internal elections and for strikes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade unions are voluntary organisations and rely on membership subscriptions. The expenditure of £4 million would be a significant burden, especially when we realise that there are much cheaper and equally acceptable ways of conducting ballots. Trade unions conduct ballots in such an expensive way because the law requires that to happen. The clause would increase significantly the financial cost of balloting. The Government have introduced clause 14 but at the same time, in last Thursday's announcement, have given notice of their intention to withdraw public money for ballots. There will be a two-way financial squeeze. The cost of ballots will increase and public money for that purpose, which was thought quite proper by both Lord Tebbit and Lord Prior, will not be available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has quoted Lord Tebbit and Lord Prior. Could she remind me of the Labour party's position on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party has always taken the position of principle: that it is wrong for the law to interfere in the internal workings of voluntary organisations.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even Lord Tebbit, who was not known for his soft attitude to trade unions or, indeed, to any other organisations, or even to the current Cabinet, did not think that it was necessary to dispose of those moneys. The financial squeeze will cause substantial difficulties for trade unions. Their membership subscription is not a bottomless pit. As the recession has continued, trade union membership has fallen, with the number of jobs lost. There is a shrinking membership base. If provisions such as clause 28 of the Bill are passed, the real level of wages may fall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady's line of argument is correct, why does she suppose that several unions have deliberately, as a matter of policy, not taken public finance for their ballots? What is the thinking behind that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Initially, more trade unions did not seek public finance because they did not like the laws being imposed on them from outside. That shows the error in the idea that voluntary organisations, freely joined, can
	<span class='label label-info column'>210</span>
be interfered with in such a way. Trade unions have seen the amount of money that the certification officer has paid out, have realised that, for the time being, the balloting arrangements will remain, and have therefore decided to take advantage of the public moneys offered to reimburse them for such expenditure. As soon as those decisions are taken, however, the Government withdraw the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke about the financial squeeze that the provisions will impose on many trade unions. That is not an accidental side effect of the Government's plan; it is central to their strategy. It will result in a shrinking membership base with lower wages, which means that trade unions will have less money with which to pursue their members' interests and to provide the service that their members value. At the same time, more expensive ballots will be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras mentioned earlier, the check-off regulations in clause 12 will cause financial instability, which will create uncertainty and make planning difficult. If the clause is agreed to, it will increase the money that trade unions have to spend on balloting as a proportion of their total expenditure. Due to the other financial strains imposed by the recession and other aspects of the legislation, trade unions will find that they have less money with which to provide decent services for their members. Here we find the core of the Government's intentions in their not-so-hidden agenda: to render it very difficult for trade unions to provide a good service and help to improve industrial relations and collective bargaining. The Government do not believe in collective bargaining. At the bottom of their hearts, they do not believe in trade unions, either. That attitude was aptly demonstrated in the Government's response to GCHQ. They refer to individual rights while it suits them and then they take them away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's proposal for postal votes verges on the ludicrous. I have spent a lifetime in the engineering industry and was surprised to see the provision regarding check-off. I shall give examples of circumstances when workers were right to make cetain decisions. I am sure that the Minister will enjoy those examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a trade unionist. I worked in the engineering industry and remember working on an unsafe job. The workers demanded safety equipment but the foreman did not think it appropriate for us to be issued with it. We asked him to take up the matter with management because the job was dangerous and we wanted safety gear. Mangement told us to get on with the job without safety equipment and to avoid delays. We were working with asbestos and needed safety equipment, but management did not know that we were working with asbestos. We threatened to down tools and to take industrial action if we were not given safety equipment, and management then came to its senses and provided safety equipment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example concerns trade union members who on Fridays had to wait until 6 o'clock to receive their wages. They decided that if they did not receive their pay at the designated time, they would go on strike. That brought management to heel and the wages were paid on time. I know some companies that still play such games and do not always pay wages on time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sometimes worked on bonus, when a new dimension was added to the job and management
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0465">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>211</span>
specified a short time for the job, so a dispute arose. The last thing that most workers wanted was to down tools and to lose their wage the following week. They worked to buy things at Christmas, to have parties, to pay their rent, and to pay their heating and other bills. We had arguments with management and, at the end of the day, management again put its foot down and said, "We want the job done and this is the price that we are prepared to pay." The workers refused to accept that and took industrial action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that all those examples are leading to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. Hogg, that my comments are leading up to postal ballots. I have never been a Van Gogh, nor do I have the literary skills of some of my more academic colleagues. I am an engineer by trade and my education did not reach great academic heights. If, in my simplistic way, I am a wee bit more elaborate than some other hon. Members in describing things to the Minister, I hope that he will understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall tell the Minister why ballots would be nonsensical in such circumstances—unless the Government wish to take democratic rights away from workers, which I am sure they do not. Let me conclude with the example of bonus, which is important in this day and age, when employers and employees are working hard to produce goods at competitive prices. Workers do not wish to be treated as slaves, and I am sure that the employers do not wish to treat them as such. It is not always the employer who is responsible: sometimes it is the management or foreman who creates the problem that leads to an argument. The workers say, "Look, we have a wage to make, and if we are working eight hours a day on a very low bonus, we will not come out with a wage at the end of the week. The disputes procedure can proceed rapidly if the management decides on Friday that it needs a job finished by the following Monday. Surely, the Minister is aware that workers sometimes have to stand their ground and refuse to work, declaring industrial action. But industrial action has many facets. It does not always mean going on strike, and a ballot would not always help in such situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government genuinely want ballots to take place, they must think the thing through. Workers should have certain democratic rights, which include the right to withdraw their labour or control their working relationships. Workers have the right to query and to demand that safety issues are considered immediately. If I were working in dangerous circumstances with a substance that I knew to be dangerous, and if the foreman and management were unaware of that fact, I, as the skilled engineer, would have to tell them. The manager may not be of the same discipline as me. He may be a production manager running a bottling line and I may be the engineer who has to put an asbestos lining on a braking system. It is up to me to tell the manager if I would prefer to shut the job down because the asbestos lining is crumbling and the workers should not be in an environment in which dust is being created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. On matters of health and safety, anyone has
	<span class='label label-info column'>212</span>
the option to get in touch with the Health and Safety Executive. The inspector can serve a prohibition notice, which would stop work on the site. The hon. Gentleman has raised a red herring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised at the Minister's naivety. Will he tell us how many safety inspectors are working in Strathclyde and how many factory visits they make? There are nine officers in the whole of Strathclyde—perhaps even in the whole of Scotland. By the time they get round to checking the factories, it is a joke. If the job were being done, the Minister's suggestion might be rather wiser, but it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should listen to what I have to say. In many cases, disputes arise through the experience of the worker. It is nearly always the worker who knows that a substance or situation is dangerous, or that a machine without safety guards is dangerous. I have seldom known employers say, "Don't work that today, Tommy: it needs a guard," or "You shouldn't be working that until I have fitted you with a respirator, tongs and spectacles." That does not happen because small companies do not always play the safety game.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to ballots, the Minister has suggested circumstances in which postal ballots should occur. I have experience of a factory with 1,000 workers. I worked in a squad of 70 men. We had a job to do and we did it. In some cases we had problems and the workers or the shop steward would try to negotiate with the management. We worked in a factory which had a well-organised trade union and a good employer. There were times when, had we had to stop work to hold a postal ballot which took seven days, the job would have remained undone, which would have cost the company money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's expression is somewhat quizzical. I shall be delighted to explain in more detail so that he understands my concern. Suppose that workers had a job to do that management needed to have finished by the Sunday, and that on the Friday, the machine on which the job was to be done was not up to the mark—because it lacked certain safety devices, for example. The management asked the workers to do the job—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the job to which the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Hogg, for drawing that to my attention. However, the engineering industry continues through the night and on Sundays. My comments are relevant to postal ballots and will show the Minister how difficult it is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman speaking for the union that sponsors him, which is opposed to working on a Sunday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the Minister's benefit, let me inform him that I am a member of the AEEU. I am fully paid up and have been since the age of 16. I am sponsored by USDAW. I know that the Minister has been a wee bit devious so I shall be a wee bit more devious with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0466">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>213</span>
A case may arise in which certain jobs have to be completed in a certain period and workers may try to bring an issue to a head by forcing the company to introduce proper safety measures or to agree to a final payment on the job. Suppose that we have a seven-day cooling-off period in respect of ballots. Most trade unions dealing with bonuses would allow the status quo to prevail. Therefore, if a job was not on bonus, it would be handled at less than bonus rate and so might not be done in time. The management would not want that, and arguments would ensue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one incident, a strike was threatened and the men voted to strike but the negotiations did not end there. I have never in my life heard of a case in which the strike vote and the threat of industrial action were the end of the matter and everyone hit the street thereafter. If the Minister believed that, he would be living in cloud cuckoo land. In my experience, when a decision was taken on industrial action, we still tried to negotiate ourselves out of walking out and losing wages. We usually tried to get the management to see sense but we were prepared to fight it all the way or, failing that, compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Solutions can be found 97 per cent of the time and no strike action need to be taken. Workers continue to work and, at the end of the day, progress is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am convinced that the Minister thinks that a postal ballot is a sensible and democratic road and will lessen the influence of the militants, the hard left or even the nutcase right—and the Minister knows a number of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions would be a recipe for some of the more irrational elements to beaver about in a small squad of 30 workers and to visit 30 houses, scrutinise ballot papers, and persuade members which way to vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must be aware that the home vote can be a nonsense. He has done a lot of research and I am sure that he knows that workers bring their ballot papers into work and ask their more experienced, more knowledgeable colleagues what they should do. In certain circumstances, postal ballots can be manipulated not to prevent but to encourage strikes. I am sure that the Minister is devouring every word that I am saying and that he will come back to this point when he sums up. If that is the way in which the Government intend to run trade unionism and the country, they have another thing coming. Employers would go bananas if such a provision were imposed on them. They would not be able to influence the workers in the example that I have given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A postal vote in that context would probably be more manipulated, more interfered with and less democratic than a ballot that is held at the workplace, where there are men and women with knowledge of the industry and of their particular grievance. I am sure, however, that the Minister will still wander down that road and support the clause. I would encourage him not to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have worked in good factories that have been well organised both by the employer and by the trade unions. Good, harmonious relationships have survived in such factories. I say "survived" because of the many pressures on companies outside the workplace. Those relationships have survived the Government's stupid policies—their mad economic policies and their policies on safety and Sunday trading. Workers, management and employers have to operate within those circumstances. I believe that
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
good common sense prevails in British industry none the less. A minimal number of strikes take place and it is not those strikes that cause the Government heartbreak.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fundamentally believe in the right to a ballot. I am delighted that workers have a right to a ballot. We can go overboard on ballot madness, however. This is strangely crazy. I have outlined many areas that could cause problems—disputes on bonus, disputes on times and bonus, safety, wages not being paid on time. I have mentioned ballots. Bullying can take place at home. There is propaganda of different kinds. However, if a worker takes a decision at his place of work, he is likely to be more informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may not have worked in the places that I have, but surely he does not believe that workers are thick and must be led by the nose and bullied. The British worker is a very powerful man. He is a trade unionist who knows his rights. The ordinary men and women in the street, especially the women, put on their tackety boots and their knuckle-dusters and know what they want. They will not be bullied by ballots and strike action; they know what they are saying and doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must realise that, in Britain, we are endowed with common sense. However, when I look at the Minister's proposals for secret ballots, common sense flies out the window. It has "gone doon" the Clyde on a banana boat. I thought that the banana boat was built in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must put another point to the Minister. Who takes part in postal ballots? In a squad of 100 men, eight or ten may be sick. Will they have to have a postal vote during a crisis on bonus, safety or disputed wages?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know the term "to be on the sick", which is used when someone is on sickness benefit. If someone is on the sick and the lads and lassies at work decide that a safety issue is important enought to warrant strike action, will seven days' notice have to be given?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That person may be off work because of a heart attack, in which case he could be away for months. That is not good for democracy. It is a slap in the face to suggest that one can run a small company or a small group of men and women in the same way as a national organisation. The Government have no consideration for the finances of trade unions or for the workers. The Minister must understand that much industrial action need not take place. The threat of industrial action—the ultimate deterrent—is sometimes enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and his cohorts have told us that nuclear weapons are used as a deterrent, but they would never allow their use. Workers should have the right to their ultimate deterrent. The postal vote is undemocratic and will cause nothing but problems. In fact, it could be a recipe for real industrial action. That is the last thing we want. We want Britain to be a wealthy, powerful, manufacturing nation. We would all benefit from good industrial relations, but the measure is a recipe for bad industrial relations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

registered in Britain but fly flags of convenience and engage foreign labour at miserable wages, having sacked tens of thousands of British workers. The hon. Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste) and I had the dubious honour of being paired—a contractual arrangement which may require seven days notice or terminating. The unions which did not take public finance for their ballots were sensible and probably foresaw the day when such funding would be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some aspects of the clause intrigue me. What is the position if a union wants to take industrial action and is required to hold a postal ballot, but the postal service is on strike? How could the union then hold a ballot? Would a union that was unable to conduct a ballot due to industrial action in the postal service have the right to damages from the postal workers union?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is said that approximately 18 million employed people in this country do not belong to a trade union. It is odd that those 18 million people may withdraw their labour without ballot, without notice and without stating the nature or cause of the dispute and suffer no consequences; yet, people who belong to a trade union are subject to the useless rigmerole that was so succinctly described by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham), who has now left the Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must try to tease out the real reason for the clause. It has proved difficult to do that on the previous 13 clauses and no doubt the reason for clause 14 will not be clarified either. I suspect that its purpose is to reduce the turnout in ballots on industrial action, to question the legitimacy of the result of such ballots and, perhaps most cynically, to extract finance at a rapid rate of knots from trade unions, which will then be less able to help their membership. In his opening comments, the Minister seemed to be stuck in a time warp of the 1960s and 1970s when mass meetings were held in the open air at great industrial complexes and the result of a show of hands was determined by those conducting the meeting. The Minister does not realise that Britain's industrial landscape has been blighted by 13 years of this Government's economic policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has found little favour with the organisations that responded to the Green Paper. Nevertheless, the Government are proceeding with no legitimacy, necessity or good intent. To be valid, a ballot must be secret and must have the highest possible turnout. Clause 14 would reduce that turnout because it has been proven that postal ballots produce lower turnouts. No doubt, another trade union Bill will be introduced because the Department of Employment appears to be in competition with the Department for Education to see which can churn out the most Bills. In two or three years, a Bill will be introduced with a clause stipulating that a valid ballot must have a turnout of 70, 80 or 90 per cent or some such ridiculous figure. The clause is a nonsense. The Minister knows that and I wonder why he insists on pursuing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hutton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has had the benefit of listening to my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde who brought to our proceedings something that has been lacking from Conservative contributions—common sense. He appreciated some of the practical difficulties that would arise if the Bill, as drafted, became law. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras because they would put some sanity into this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us could agree in principle with the idea that union members have the right to be balloted, especially on issues that fundamentally effect their terms and conditions of employment. That is common ground between both sides of the Committee. What the Conservatives lack is a practical appreciation of how the clause would secure the results that we all want—an improvement in the level of participation in decision-making processes in trade unions and a general improvement in the conduct of industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a sense of dèjà vu about some of the proceedings. My hon. Friends spoke earlier about how we constantly come back to Committees with further refinements to the balloting regime created by the Government because it is not working in the way that they wanted. It is clear from speeches made in the Chamber and elsewhere that the Government want less and less industrial action. It is a rather naive assumption that that could be produced by changing the decision-making process—that, somehow, postal balloting would effect decisions made by trade union members. The evidence proves that it would not effect the outcome of a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends also spoke about other motives behind the clause. In the present climate, and given the Government's statement last week about the trade union postal ballot scheme, it should be apparent to all members of the Committee that we are witnessing the imposition of a substantial and unjustifiable financial burden on to the trade union movement. There are reasons why Opposition Members have reservations about the Government's ambitions and motivation in pursuing this clause at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to speculate about what lies behind the clause in the wider context of how the Government formulate their industrial relations policy. Have they, at any time, listened to representations or studied the research about this aspect of industrial relations? Have Ministers read precis of the key research papers produced by independent academics and practitioners in the industry on the effects of the Government's balloting policies? Have they studied the Undy and Martin report produced in the early 1980s? I am sure that they have, but there is no evidence that they appreciate the evidence of that report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do the Government formulate industrial relations policy? Do they study the journals and the independent research or do they draw on the editorials of 	<i>The Daily Telegraph?</i> It is a 	<i>Telegraph</i> clause. It is not rooted in experience and is not based on what industry or the unions want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To illustrate my point, I have a copy of the Undy and Martin report. I shall hold it up so that the Minister can see the cover, because I suspect that he may not have seen it before.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a valid point. The Minister has never refrained from making silly observations in the past. We have just heard another one this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to read one or two brief passages from the report. The authors considered the impact of balloting systems on the outcome of a ballot and the likely effects of different sorts of balloting systems on membership participation rates. I quote,
	<br><blockquote><p>"As in elections to union office the level of participation is likely to be higher in workplace ballots than in postal ballots."</p></blockquote>
In short, the use of ballots is likely to have a limited, but positive, effect on the level of membership participation, but a more substantial effect on the accuracy of the count.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with the two latter points, but the reservation of Opposition Members is that, in preferring postal balloting to other types of balloting, the Government are cutting off their noses to spite themselves. If the common ground between us is a desire to see higher participation rates in the democratic decision-making process, why do the Government prefer a balloting method that is likely to depress rather than increase the level of participation in that process? That seems extraordinary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is even more extraordinary if one considers the earlier legislation that the clause seeks to amend. Subsection 230(3) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 shows the sort of common sense that should be displayed in the Bill. That subsection makes it clear that a variety of balloting practices is sustainable and acceptable. Although the clear preference of the previous section was for postal ballots, a variety of ballots is acceptable. I have yet to hear a convincing case from the Government as to why one sort of balloting system should be preferred to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not be driven by ideology. We do not want legislative zealousness. We need a system that will produce higher participation rates in the decision-making process and provide a balloting system that is convenient and practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some practicality in a ballot paper arriving at home; there is also some practicality in having access to a secret ballot at the workplace. In previous legislation, the Government have supported workplace ballots. They have never argued that workplace ballots are fundamentally corrupt, or incapable of delivering a fair and secret ballot result. If the Government have access to such information, let us hear it. We have not heard it before, and I suspect that we shall not hear it today. Why, therefore, are the Government driving ahead? My hon. Friends have suggested that the Government are pursuing
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
something other than the express desire to improve the decision-making process within trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider the history and background to the clause, there is evidence of the Government's surprising change of direction. If we consider the Green Paper, which preceded the publication of the Bill, the Government conceded the point that there may be an argument for postal ballots in cases involving more than 50 members, but not in other cases. In the 1987 Green Paper, the Government adopted an almost hostile view towards postal ballots on industrial action. The 1987 Green Paper states in column 95 that postal ballots were a "less suitable" way of deciding on strike action. Suddenly they are the only possible method of public consultation of trade union members. That makes no sense at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other interesting part of the clause is that, back in the 1970s when the Government first began their review of industrial relations legislation, they favoured having no postal ballots to decide on industrial action. The Industrial Relations Act 1971 imposed no compulsory requirement for unions to consult their members about strike action. The Government then took the view that union members were militant. The last thing that the Government wanted was to impose trade union balloting, as they suspected that it would produce the wrong result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later in the 1970s and during the 1980s their attitude changed. Union leaders were perceived to be militant. The solution to that problem was to have more postal ballots. All such suppositions are complete rubbish. There is no evidence that the balloting devices used will affect the results in any way. The Undy and Martin study makes that clear. I wonder whether the Government have referred to that study at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is unnecessary. The Government would be forcing a particular balloting practice on the trade unions, which would not improve industrial relations and would depress rather than increase levels of membership participation in the decision-making process. Why will not the Government listen to common sense and support the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, so that there would be access to a proper ballot, practical operations for the ballots to take place and improved industrial relations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to add to the arguments of my hon. Friends by expressing my fundamental objection to the clause, as drafted. I have no objections to postal ballots; on the contrary, I am in favour of them. I voted by post recently in the elections to the executive of my building society. I was happy to do so, as there was no opportunity for a workplace ballot. I found it convenient to vote by post in the past three general elections. I have voted by post on several other occasions. I have no objection to postal ballots per se but I object to the way in which the Government would prescribe how an independent organisation, which is owned and controlled by its members, conducts its business. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) has already made that point. It is a fundamental freedom in society that organisations of individuals, who come together to decide their own fate and who contribute financially to each other, decide the way in which to organise and control their business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0469">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey said, if the Government had treated Solidarity in the same way, they would not have expressed support for Solidarity and it would not have developed. Such restrictions are, in my view, unacceptable, for those fundamental reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not prescribe the way in which charities regulate their activities. Charities take major decisions but there is no prescription about whether they should hold a postal or workplace ballot. The same is true of political parties. There cannot be a more major decision than the election of the leader of a political party, yet there is no prescription by the Government as to how the ballot for that organisational change should take place. I am a member of the Royal Automobile Club. The Government do not prescribe how I should be consulted about my membership or how I should control or participate in the future direction of that body. I am a member of the Liverpool football club supporters' association. There is no prescription set down by Goverment about how I could influence or control that organisation. I suspect that the Government do not intend to introduce such a prescription. Why are the Government intent upon prescribing how another group of people, who want to participate in a free and fair decision-making process, should organise their own business?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We share much of the Government's concern about objectives. No Opposition Member is against secret ballots, although ballots in the home are not necessarily secret. Opposition Members want high turnouts and decisions to be made rationally, without hotheadedness and without militancy, under the general procedures. The clause will create lack of flexibility and will prevent unions at local level from deciding on the best way to organise their affairs—not the Government's affairs or the employers' affairs, but the unions' affairs at local level. Turnouts will be lower and participation generally will fall. In addition, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey said, the additional costs will be crippling for many unions, which I am sure is the Government's secret agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Transport and General Workers union—before the Minister flicks through "Dod's" I can tell him that I am not a member and never have been—will be approximately £900,000 a year worse off. That figure will increase as ballots continue. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey referred to £4 million being spent last year on ballots, and that figure will increase. The stipulation for postal ballots will make those costs more and more crippling for unions, which will reduce the valuable services that are provided by responsible trade unions to help their members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support all the arguments of my hon. Friends. The provision will increase costs and administration, reduce turnout and flexibility and will put unnecessary burdens on trade unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the time is right. What has changed since his predecessors issued the Green Paper saying that that was not so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to column 166 of the report of our proceedings on 10 December. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For those Conservative Members who attach importance to the manifesto on which they were elected—I genuinely believe that they should, even when it does not suit me—".[	<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee F, 10 December 1992; c. 166.]</p></blockquote>
If the hon. Gentleman genuinely believes that, I refer him to the Conservative manifesto which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We will legislate to require that all pre-strike ballots are postal and subject to independent scrutiny, and that at least seven days' notice of a strike is given after the ballot."</p></blockquote>
That is clear and categoric. Last week, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that we should stand by our manifesto commitments. That is exactly what we are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the Minister again: what has changed? He cannot claim that the Tory election manifesto puts forward an argument; it announces a policy. There is no argument in the manifesto. We are asking what has changed. What is different? Which considerations have been brought to bear to bring about this substantial change in the Government's attitude from all previous Green Papers that they have issued?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have always said, and I have heard it said on several occasions in Conservative circles, that we should move to fully postal ballots. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden says "Golf club". I am not a member of a golf club. The only organisation of which I have been a member and on which I can enlighten the Committee was the National Union of Mineworkers, which had workplace ballots. I took part in several of those workplace ballots and did not believe them to be the most satisfactory way of conducting a ballot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has undergone a great conversion on the question of ballots for industrial action. I wish that they had been singing a similar tune in 1984 when a ballot which was conducted by various members of the National Union of Mineworkers overwhelmingly rejected strike action. Nevertheless, strike action was forced upon us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, Labour's great conversion is treated with scepticism. What a comment the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) managed to make this morning. He told us how wise our previous industrial relations legislation was and how wise was our attitude to ballots. Had he been a Member of Parliament at the time, I doubt whether he would have said anything like that, and I doubt whether we should have had the support of the Labour party when we took that Bill—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall carry on because I should like to make progress. The hon. Gentleman might find my next comments interesting.

	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
I am trying to be as non-controversial as possible in examining what the Labour party has said in the past. This morning, Labour Members spoke about funding ballots. That has a long history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Norman Atkinson, a former Member of Parliament who took part in the Second Reading on what was then the 1980 Employment Bill said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sure that trade unions will want to be very careful indeed about applying for money to cover the cost of ballots."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17 December 1979; Vol. 976, c.92.]</p></blockquote>
Michael Welsh said that it would be "immoral" for money to be made available to subsidise ballots when there were so many other calls on the public purse. John Grant said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far as I am aware, there is no demand from anywhere, certainly not from any trade union, for these funds … Indeed, the general view is that this is not a desirable development."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> Standing Committee A, 24 January 1980; c.25.]</p></blockquote>
What Labour Members are saying this morning is not the same as what was said when the funds were made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I correct the Minister on one point? When he reads the record of what I said today, he will note that I did not say that the Industrial Relations Act 1971 was a good idea. I was drawing attention to the fact that in 1971 the Conservative party had a different view about the role of balloting in industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point that he has just made about trade union ballots and funds for them, will the Minister confirm that the Government have changed their minds? You have just scrapped the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that you have, Mr. Hogg—the Government have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I wrongly attributed my earlier comments to the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness, I withdraw them in relation to him. He was praising the way in which the previous legislation gave a variety of opportunities. We can argue about what the record says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we have moved to a system of fully postal ballots and that is the law, I think that it is right to say that we shall give—and that we have given—the trade unions quite a lot of notice about our future funding arrangements. My hon. Friend the Minister of State promised that we would make an announcement by the time the Committee considered clause 14. That announcement is not usually made until January. The fact that we wanted to be open with the Committee and to give people time to be aware of what we were doing led us to make an earlier announcement than normal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton raised the concerns of the Chamber of Shipping Ltd. I shall reflect on those concerns. I shall consider carefully the representations which will be made about a specific and individual problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While on the subject of shipping, will the Minister confirm that what was the National Union of Seamen, which is now the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, conducts a postal ballot of its members involved in a dispute who are on shore, but that it cables deep-sea shipping to conduct a workplace ballot? The result is
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
conveyed by cable. What procedures would the union have to follow in order to hold a postal ballot? Would it send the postal ballot form to the home of a member who may be on a ship going from Rio to Sydney? Or would it send the forms to the ship? If the union were to do that, the Government's arguments in favour of postal ballots would not apply, because that would be a postal workplace ballot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that I shall consider the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton. I shall find an appropriate time to come back to the Committee or, more likely, I shall discuss it on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for what the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said about strikes and the number of work days lost under a Conservative Government and under a Labour Government. What a lie that gives to the fact that Labour Governments get on better with trade unions than Conservative Governments and that Labour's industrial relations were better. The hon. Gentlemen said that 29 million days were lost under a Labour Government as opposed to the 24 million days which were the maximum lost under a Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were maximums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were the maximums over all periods of Government. I am glad to say that that has been substantially improved and that the number of strikes is at its lowest level for over 100 years. Our industrial relations policy is one of the reasons why we are attracting inward investment. Full postal ballots would be another way of ensuring that members could freely, in their own time, express their view on whether they wished to vote for strike action. None of the Opposition's arguments has convinced me that that would be a wrong step. All that Opposition have told me is how it would inconvenience trade union members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister seems to be unwilling or unable to say what has changed between the time of this and previous Government proposals, will he explain why postal ballots would be the only fair way of conducting trade union ballots? Is he dissatisfied that general elections are held in a static place, which makes that election more like a workplace ballot?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that is a fair comparison. We have made it easier for people, such as those on holiday, to obtain postal ballots. We have made considerable progress on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been trying to understand the Minister's arguments. Will he confirm that the Government were persuaded to insert clause 14, which demands postal ballots in all elections, by the Conservative party election manifesto which contained that pledge? If that is the case, will the Minister explain why the Bill would abolish wages councils, which were not mentioned in the Conservative party election manifesto?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not everything a Government do is set out in their manifesto. The Government made it clear on several previous occasions that there was no place in the labour market for wages councils. That has been the Government's opinion for some time and we have taken
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0471">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
this opportunity to put that into operation. To offer full postal ballots is important and gives a greater democracy to trade union members. I ask my hon. Friends to vote against the amendment and to support the clause as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have not adduced a single cogent argument for insisting on full postal ballots for all industrial disputes. The Minister has not provided a single recent example of a misconducted ballot in the workplace. I have found one, but the Minister has not found any. Out of almost a thousand representations that have been made in the four years that CROTUM has been producing annual reports, in only one case that has gone to the High Court was there a finding in favour of the complainant. The Minister has not even come up with spurious, lying reports from 	<i>The Sun</i> or the 	<i>Daily Mail,</i> because even they have not been able to find any. Therefore the Government's case is based completely on prejudice and nothing else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the basic point. We know that the Tories encourage postal ballots. They have gone to enormous lengths, spending millions of pounds of taxpayers' money, on encouraging people who live abroad and pay no tax in this country, to sign on, so that they can have a postal vote in order to impose the council tax on the rest of us. We know that they are keen on postal votes. That is their Hong Kong approach. Nevertheless, they have produced no evidence that, a postal ballot on an industrial dispute will be any fairer—not a jot. They have adduced no evidence that the system of voting that brought Members to Parliament is inadequate for people in their place of work, using exactly the same method of a secret ballot—a ballot box and guaranteed secrecy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that they did not like the Social Science Research Council and duly abolished it, but they cannot invalidate the facts adduced in the report referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness, because it was not a question of opinion-polling. It checked the turnout at elections and sought the reasons for those turnouts. In the proposal, the Government insist on a form of voting that they expect will reduce the turnout in such elections. As I said earlier, anyone involved in election legislation who tries to reduce the turnout is always on the fiddle. The Government are once again on the fiddle. We believe that they are wrong. That is why we oppose the clause. I shall press amendment No. 65 to a vote, but I shall not pursue amendment No. 63 further. Therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I realise that because of the time, the Committee will hear my speech in two parts. I shall try to divide it for the Committee's convenience. Originally this was intended to be a probing amendment. I was tempted to withdraw it when I saw a copy of the letter that was issued to Committee members last week. However, I now think that the amendment is worth discussing in some detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In earlier discussions we heard about the important role that the scrutineer—someone of integrity and repute—will play in all trade union ballots. The Government and the trade union will consider that person to be suitable to conduct ballots. However, from the way in which the clause has been drafted and from the discussions that have taken place so far this morning, that person cannot be regarded as suitable to determine the method of ballot. I want to probe that aspect in some detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that failure to allow the principle of flexibility goes to the root of concerns about freedom of association. The question must be put on record: do the Government believe in freedom of association or not? We have heard interesting points—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
