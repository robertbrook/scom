	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was tabled to raise general issues on the clause, partly to give the Attorney-General, whose presence we welcome, the opportunity to explain the Government's view on the rather complicated legal aspects of the Bill. Before he does that, I should like to make a couple of preliminary points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Community recognised from the outset, in the treaty of Rome, that a common market was not being set up for the benefit of business and the bosses alone. It was recognised that Governments and Community institutions would have social obligations to the people of Europe and to work forces. Against that background, on the basis of the treaty, a directive was issued, as long ago as 1979, to protect the rights and entitlements of employees whose jobs were transferred from one organisation to another. The basis of that directive was that employees were not pawns or chattels but people with rights, whose pay, conditions and collective agreements should be sustained and honoured by their new bosses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between 1979 and 1981, the Conservative Government attempted, as usual, to water down and/or evade the provisions of the directive. Eventually, they were forced to seem to comply with the directive, and they passed the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations which were supposed to meet the terms of the directive. Clause 26 aims to amend those regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Introducing the regulations, the Minister, who later became Lord Waddington, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am recommending them with a remarkable lack of enthusiasm."</p></blockquote>
He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have done a great deal to mitigate some of the worst effects of the directive."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 December 1981; Vol. 14,</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
What he called "worst effects", most people call the rights and entitlements of employees. In particular, what the Government referred to as non-commercial ventures were excluded from the regulations. That was intended to ensure that the regulations did not cover transfers arising from privatisations, from compulsory competitive tendering and from market testing in local government, the civil service and the national health service. As a result, people who were transferred, threatened with transfer or whose undertakings were being transferred could be sacked, have their pay reduced or their holiday and other entitlements removed when the transfers took place, solely to ensure that employing them or others in their place would be cheaper for their new private operators than was the case in the public sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most disturbing features of that history is that, as early as 1983, the Law Officers of the Crown advised that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the limitation in the Regulations to commercial undertakings was not a satisfactory implementation of the United Kingdom's Community obligations."</p></blockquote>
Those are not my words but the words of the Treasury Solicitor. I remind the Committee that those Government obligations were not just to the European Community but to fellow citizens, tens of thousands of whom were laid off, paid off and saw their standards of living reduced. Through that admission—made way back in 1983, nine long years ago, which until recently has been kept secret—we know that the British Government at that time were knowingly breaking the law and robbing people in this country of their rights. Those rights were not theoretical rights but rights to a job, to pay, to holidays, to sick pay and to maternity leave. Many people who were badly off were made worse off as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For nine years there was a cover-up by well-paid Law Officers and Ministers. Had not it been for events outside Britain, it is clear that we should never have known that the Government believed and knew that they were breaking the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government faced problems when cases that needed interpretation of the directive arose from incidents in other European countries. The European Court of Justice was called to rule on those cases and its judgements made it crystal clear that the Tory Government were robbing people in Britain of their rights. The decisive legal test was whether the business transferred had retained its identity and whether the functions performed were carried out or resumed by the new organisation. The European Court of Justice said that the directive had
	<br><blockquote><p>"the object of guaranteeing the rights of employees"</p></blockquote>
Therefore, even the switching of funding by a public body could be a legal transfer for the purposes of the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As recently as October last year, in the Anne Watson Rask and Kirsten Christensen 	<i>v.</i> Iss. Kantinservice A/S case, the Advocate General of the European Court stated that contracting out the staff canteen from an employer to a contractor was covered by the directive. That really put the cat among the pigeons. Several cases were launched in the British Courts. Industrial tribunal cases were brought by trade unions in support of members who had been deprived of their rights. I suggest to Conservative Members that, that is an example of the immense value of having trade unions to represent workers, because workers definitely need help when they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>503</span>
are up against a combination of ruthless employers and a Government who were deceiving the people of this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission recently reported that the British Government were breaking the directive in no fewer than five different ways. The Government finally had to take action. They have introduced the Bill. In many senses, its major function is to delete the exclusion of non-commercial transfers so that they will be included in the regulations. However, Mr. Knox, I can assure you that the Governmment have not given up trying to keep the exclusion going. When local councils have quite properly warned would-be tenderers for services that the directive may apply and that tenderers may not be able to reduce terms and conditions of employment if they undertake a new function, those councils have been warned by the Department of the Environment that they are breaking the law on competitive tendering. Warnings have been issued by the Secretary of State for the Environment who, in his previous incarnation as Secretary of State for Employment, should have been sorting the matter out throughout all the years that he was doing that job. Of course, his main job at that time was fiddling the unemployment figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are telling honest councils that they should clam up and mislead people who are tendering for jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hartley Booth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman persists in saying that the Government have deceived and robbed the public. Does he accept that the public benefit every time that there are savings through efficiency of up to 20 per cent? How does he explain the fact that when Manchester council put out its bids, following the 1988 legislation, it said that it would win all the open tendering contracts and find 17 per cent. savings by means of transfers within its own departments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the council in question had not reduced the pay or terms and conditions of employment of the people concerned, no deception was involved. Most of the cost reductions have been at the expense of badly paid street cleaners, dustbin collectors and dinner ladies. Any reductions in pay or terms and conditions were unlawful, and since 1983 the Government knew that they were unlawful. The hon. Member for Finchley (Mr. Booth) should have waited a minute. It is clear, from documents that have come into my possession, that every honest lawyer in Government service and most counsel from whom they have sought advice, at taxpayers' expense, have said, "The game's up, the Government are in the wrong and the Bill must put things right." In short, they have been advised to plead, "It's a fair cop, guv, we're bang to rights."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government dislike having to admit that. In recent years, when the Government have been found guilty of breaking British domestic law they have responded not by obeying the law but by changing the law to what they would like it to be. It comes as a shock to them to discover that under European law that cannot be done, because European laws apply to Governments as well as to individuals and companies. This causes trouble for the Government. It irritates Euro-sceptics, free-market fanatics, and—perhaps most importantly—may cause
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
embarrassment and financial difficulties for various supporters and financiers of the Tory party who have made fortunes by taking over public services, cutting wages and worsening working conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should put everything right, but since it was published there has been a ministerial smokescreen. The hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth), usually a man of plain words, has said that just because the existing exemption excluded privatisation from the rules, that does not mean that, if the exemption is dropped, privatisation will be covered by the rules. That is a fair summary of his position. The Secretary of State for Employment wrote to the hon. Member for Shipley (Sir M. Fox) saying that Britain may try to have the directive, formulated as long ago as 1977, withdrawn because of concern about subsidiarity, an invention of the devil of recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may seek to have the directive withdrawn, but they will have problems if they consult the Edinburgh summit declaration, which made it quite clear that it had nothing to do with the social chapter and the social charter. The European Community expected that there would be more, rather than less, social legislation based on the treaty of Rome and the Single European Act. It is fairly unlikely that the British Government will succeed. However, the Attorney-General has been wheeled in to clear everything up. He will explain the law to us, and I wish him well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like answers to the following questions. If the Law Officers knew that the Government were breaking the law and robbing thousands of citizens of their rights as far back as 1983, why has it taken nine years for them to do anything about it? Could the Attorney-General tell us whose fault it is that there has been a nine-year delay? Did the Law Officers do nothing, or did they make representations to the Cabinet, who turned down their representations? Can he tell us what the changes in the Bill will mean? Will there be a dodgy, British exemption which has not applied hitherto? If there is, no doubt it will eventually end up in the European Court of Justice, with the taxpayer having to pay for the pleadings when the Government, as usual, are found guilty. When will the Government comply with the law and when will the various Departments, including the Scottish Office, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Health and the Welsh Office start to give lawful advice to the authorities with whom they deal? Will the tens of thousands of badly off people who have been unlawfully and since 1983, knowingly robbed by the Government be repaid and compensated—and if not, why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General (Sir Nicholas Lyell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Committee's invitation to explain the meaning and effect of clause 26, which introduces amendments to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always a pleasure to listen to the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) and I am pleased to see that he is in no less good form than when I see him across the Dispatch Box in the Chamber. If I recognise a little hyperbole and over-enthusiasm, the hon. Gentleman is in familiar form, which we welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>505</span>
The hon. Gentleman asked several questions. From the way in which he phrased his last few questions, he seems to know that I am here to answer some of them, but not others. I am here in my capacity as a Law Officer to help and advise the Committee on the meaning and effect of clause 26.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law on employment rights on the transfer of undertakings is sometimes considered to be more complex than it is. I suspect—my suspicions are confirmed by some of the hon. Gentleman's comments—that the clause and the amendments it makes are believed to have more effect in changing the law than is in fact the case, but I shall come to that aspect later. The interpretation of the law in this area depends to a great extent on case law, both in domestic tribunals and in the European Court of Justice. Those who examine the case law will know that it derives from cases which are by no means confined to the United Kingdom and that most of the leading cases come from other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interpretation of the key question of whether there has been a transfer of an undertaking has been well settled for some years. I shall refer later to the leading case of Spijkers in 1986 [1986] ECR 1119. It may be helpful if I first say something about the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The acquired rights directive was adopted by the Community under article 100 of the treaty of Rome in 1977. The transfer regulations were made in 1981 to implement the directive. Their scope was expressed to be limited to transfers of undertakings in the nature of a commercial venture. This was not intended to restrict the regulations to the private sector or to commercial undertakings in a narrow sense. Those words were included to reflect the view then taken on the scope of article 100 of the treaty. The European Commission has challenged those words as too restrictive and the Government have accepted that it is appropriate that they should be removed from the regulations. That change of wording is thus designed to render our regulations more clearly in conformity with Community law—I emphasise the words "more clearly in conformity" because that is one of the aspects that is required of European law, even though the law applies in substance, in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the period since 1981, the regulations have, in fact, often been applied in the public sector in circumstances where the operation being transferred could be described as an undertaking, or part of an undertaking, which is in the nature of a commercial venture. It is important to note that the undertaking does not actually have to be a commercial venture, or to operate commercially, or to make a profit before transfer, although it will usually be the intention that it should do so after transfer. The Committee will recognise that it is now often considered, for example, that self-contained public sector operations are capable of being transferred to a private sector body as a going concern and run commercially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not, therefore, the case that the amendment in subsection (2), which removes the restriction to undertakings
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the nature of a commercial venture",</p></blockquote>
has the effect of extending the regulations to the public sector. They have always covered the public sector. The extending effect of the amendment is very much more limited. In practice, it extends the scope to undertakings
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
that are not run on commercial lines—as, for example, some charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the amendment does not "extend" the regulations to contracting out or to competitive tendering. The regulations already apply to such activities if they involve a transfer of an undertaking—I pick my words carefully—or part of an undertaking. It is clear from the case law that under both the directive and the regulations this means the transfer of an economic entity which is capable of operating as a going concern and which retains its identity. The contracting out of a service is not a transfer of an undertaking unless it involves enough of the elements of the original operation, such as premises, staff, good will or customer base, to constitute the transfer of a going concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those criteria, whether they apply to a commercial business providing products or to a service, are not affected by the amendment in subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if I spell out the criteria for the benefit of the Committee by referring to one of the leading cases—the Spijkers case. Lawyers and others who examine the law will discover that what I am about to quote will be found in many cases. It is common for European Court judgments to pick up and reiterate principles by, very sensibly, using the same words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one is trying to decide whether there is a transfer for the purpose of the directive or the regulations, one can take guidance from the Spijkers case—case 24 1985 with judgment on 18 March 1986. I quote from the middle of paragraph 11:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It follows that the decisive criterion for establishing whether there is a transfer for the purposes of the directive is whether the business in question retains its identity.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Consequently, a transfer of an undertaking, business or part of a business does not occur merely because its assets are disposed of."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Indeed, it is necessary to consider, in a case such as the present, whether the business was disposed of as a going concern, as would be indicated, inter alia, by the fact that its operation was actually continued or resumed by the new employer, with the same or similar activities.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In order to determine whether those conditions are met, it is necessary to consider all the facts characterizing the transaction in question, including the type of undertaking or business, whether or not the business's tangible assets, such as buildings and movable property, are transferred, the value of its intangible assets at the time of the transfer, whether or not the majority of its employees are taken over by the new employer, whether or not its customers are transferred and the degree of similarity between the activities carried on before and after the transfer and the period, if any, for which those activities were suspended. It should be noted, however, that all those circumstances are merely single factors in the overall assessment which must be made and cannot therefore be considered in isolation."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my right hon. and learned Friend will agree that it is important to clarify at this stage, especially in the context of his statement, the difficult issues that have arisen, perhaps as a result of Opposition propaganda or as a result of the uncertainty of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my right hon. and learned Friend focus on the problems currently faced by schools in Leeds, which will be given full responsibility for their budgets in the coming year? Many of them may wish to consider cancelling centrally provided services such as cleaning, catering and landscape gardening, which may be provided by the local education authority, but which schools may wish to put out to other organisations. Will the schools, breaking up

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
what was presumably, a large contract, be caught by the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My answer has two parts. The first is that, as a matter of law, it will depend very much on the way in which the new operation is carried out compared with the way in which it was carried out in the past. The principles that will be applied by those giving legal advice to the schools or anyone else in that position, are exactly the principles that I have just read to the Committee from one of the leading cases. It might be possible to do it in more than one way: one might lead to the transfer of a going concern as an existing entity and another might involve creating a new entity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must be clear about my function in coming to the Committee. My function is to advise the Committee on the meaning and effect of the law, not to gloss the European Court cases or to purport to give general advice on what are, inevitably and rightly, limited facts. However, I have explained to the Committee the way in which one approaches such questions and the body of law—I have read out some of the more detailed legal aspects—that would be considered by lawyers advising those schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Attorney-General. Does he have an opinion on whether the hospitals that have transferred to trust status, which are doing the same jobs with the same staff and the same customer base—I prefer to call it patient base—will fall within the scope of the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's question ties in with what I was going to say in the second part of my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste). I am not here to answer questions about hospitals in the hon. Lady's constituency, but the broader points of construction do apply to that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of my answer is that the amendments to clause 26 are unlikely to affect the position greatly one way or the other. The principles that will be applied can already be found in existing law. Although the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras entertained us, and although much of what he said may make good copy in the newspapers, he was glossing the issue and, unintentionally, giving an impression that may cause some to believe that the changes caused by the clause are far more radical than they actually are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Attorney-General give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, in a second. To answer my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet and the hon. Member for Wallasey, those issues will be dealt with in accordance with principles which are already well established by the case law and are little, if at all, affected by the amendments to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my right hon. and learned Friend confirm my understanding of the situation? When the regulations were introduced, they extended to employees of unincorporated businesses the same protection that applied to company employees when the shares of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
company were acquired. In other words, the transaction that switched control of the entity did not affect the employees' terms of employment. Nothing in the regulations prevents the new owner of the business from making changes and variations to the terms of employment contracts, once the transfer has been effected. However, the costs of implementing those changes have switched from the transferor to the transferee. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To pick up the latter part of my hon. Friend's question, if the employee has acquired rights within the meaning of the directive and the regulations, and if there is a transfer of an entity—an undertaking as a going concern—the employee takes those rights with him and the new employer becomes responsible for those rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The big question is whether the transfer is of a going concern. That is to be tested and decided in accordance with the principles that I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows from previous encounters that the last thing I want to do is pretend to be a lawyer. When we pretend, we usually try to raise our status in life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman confirm that other rulings by the European Court confirm that a switch of funding from a public body could be a legal transfer for the purposes of the directive? Could he also confirm that, in the Rask case, the Advocate-General's decision—which is, admittedly, not a decision of the court, although most Governments would be dubious about challenging it—was that the contracting-out of a staff canteen from an employer to a contractor was covered by the directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to both those questions is yes, they maybe but I doubt that the position is as dramatic and wonderful as the hon. Gentleman believes. The first case to which he referred is, I think, Dutch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Redmond case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Redmond case. That was a case in which public funding was provided for a drugs unit in Holland to help drug takers on a charitable basis. That public funding was switched from one charitable foundation to another, which took on the same employees. There is nothing remarkable about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also possible for a canteen that is a going concern to be transferred to a new undertaking and to carry those rights. It would probably be possible for the services of the canteen—the provision of food and drink to people at large or in a particular area—to be transferred in such a way that the acquired rights directive would not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Rooney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Attorney-General saying that all activities generally regarded as compulsory competitive tendering fall within the jurisdiction of the TUPE regulations and that, in the past 10 years, their application has been misinterpreted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman would do well to listen to my contribution as a whole, or to take the opportunity of reading it. Such a transfer could fall within

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>509</span>
the ambit of the regulations and the acquired rights directive. The object of the regulations is to implement in British law the acquired rights directive which, through our membership of the European Community, is part of British law. One reason why we are making these changes is that the law should be clear beyond doubt. That is why, by means of subsection (2), we are taking out words that, although they do not have a vast effect, were thought to be misleading. Whether or not a particular contracting-out, such as a market testing for example, which has been much discussed in the briefing material before the Committee, will constitute a transfer within the regulations and, therefore, attract the effects of the regulations will depend on the way that it is done. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would know that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 26 does not make remarkable or radical changes to the law. However, some people seem to have woken up to the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and to the acquired rights directive, neither of which they seem to have considered before. I strongly suspect that, in all the hyperbole and discussions many trade unions are doing themselves an injustice. I find it hard to believe that they were not aware of the regulations before. Time will tell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the right hon. and learned Gentleman to mean that each case should be judged on its merits. He has also said that the law has not changed since 1981 and that all that the Government want to do is to clear up some unfortunate wording in the law. If that is the case, can the Attorney-General tell us what legal advice led the Department of Health to stop compulsory competitive tendering in the national health service? The first meeting of the TUPE group on 3 December 1992 was chaired by Mr. T. J. G. Pratt and the secretary was Mrs. V. Collett. A minute from that meeting states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Following a meeting with Department of Health officials there was now a moratorium in the Health Service on market testing".</p></blockquote>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows about legal advice. What legal advice was given to the Department of Health that led it to introduce the moratorium? We must bear in mind that the regulations were always in place. According to the right hon. and learned Gentleman's legal opinion, nothing whatsoever has changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has changed? Was the Department breaking the law since 1981 and was it legally advised that it had been breaking the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can understand the hon. Gentleman getting excited about the document from which he is reading, although the only really exciting thing about it is that it was leaked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the best of my knowledge—I have to take my advice from others—there is no such moratorium. If he wants to pursue that point, he must do so with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health. I am here to explain the law to the Committee, not to answer questions such as that which the hon. Gentleman asked me, which is unsoundly based. I am sorry to disappoint him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not ask the Attorney-General about a political point, because I realise that he is here to clarify the law. I asked him what legal advice was given by the Treasury Solicitor to the Department of Health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>510</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received some assistance and I shall pass that information on to the hon. Gentleman, although it may be more limited than he would hope. I understand that the Department of Health is continuing its market-testing programme. It has to await the outcome of the judicial review in the South Glamorgan district health authority catering contract case before it can begin to let similar contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) asked about the Redmond and Rask cases. It is absolutely standard that a European Court judgment should be to the effect that in such cases there could be a transfer. That is not to say that there necessarily was a transfer. Whether there was a transfer in either of those cases was not decided by the European Court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will appreciate, when one goes to the European Court, usually on an article 177 reference, one is going for a preliminary ruling of the Court about the nature of the law. The case goes back to the domestic courts—those in our own country—which decide the case on the facts, in accordance with the enunciated principles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Attorney-General's constructive interpretation of the Redmond and Spijker cases, which have perplexed many people. Clarification of the law has to be the first duty of legislating. If it comes down to the discretion of the court adjudicating—whether or not following a 177 reference—are not those companies which have relied on Government policy to produce tendering proposals and which have won tendering contracts left in a fog? How can we ensure that clarity prevails?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will understand from what I have said that the principles to be applied are well settled. The burden of much of my advice to the Committee is that those principles have been well settled for a long time. They would not be radically affected by the changes proposed in the clause, which would tidy up and bring the law into conformity with the principles. The principles used in cases such as those mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley have been well settled for years. They are not too difficult to apply. There is no need for those companies to be in a fog. When people realise that the clause would not produce radical and dramatic effects which undercut the law as it was previously understood, they should be able to be calmer and to approach it according to basic principles, as I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The burden of part of the Attorney-General's advice to the Committee is that the clause would do a little tidying up and that the law will remain what it was. He suggested that I had gone in for a bit of exaggeration—which I do from time to time—but I was being careful today. Can the Attorney-General confirm that the Treasury Solicitor's letter on 18 December to the legal secretariat to the Law Officers, asking them for the ruling that we have today, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In 1983 the Law Officers advised together with Professor Francis Jacobs … that the limitation in the Regulations to commercial undertakings was not a satisfactory implementation of the UK's Community obligations"?</p></blockquote>
If it was not satisfactory, why has nothing been done?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a great deal of argument on that point. Eventually the discussion with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
the Commission led to an article 169 letter, a reasoned opinion and eventually the bringing of proceedings. We have put in a defence in those proceedings. The Government, very sensibly, have taken the view that, rather than fight over this matter, it is better to tidy up and clarify this area of the law. That is right and proper, and in accordance with the advice that has been proffered for some time. Nevertheless, this is an arguable point which may need to be ventilated further—although we hope that the Bill will be enacted and the matter put beyond doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to clause 26(2), I am anxious to explain to the Committee the confined ambit of the change in the law. As the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said—he is inclined to exaggerate from time to time, but I acquit him of malice in that—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would rather be guilty of malice than exaggeration!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was savouring some of the hon. Gentleman's earlier remarks, but rather than focus on his words, which may not have reverberated round the law offices of the world in the way he would have hoped, it is important to focus on the real effect of the change set against the well-established state of the law as it covers the vast majority of the transactions with which we are dealing. Clause 26(2) amends the law in a confined way and makes it clear that the kind of charitable operation to which I have referred is capable of falling within the ambit of the directive. The extra words, which will now be expunged, may have been misleading; but people would have been unlikely to be misled about the general interpretation of the law governing normal commercial operations, whether public or private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hutton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the right hon. and learned Gentleman clear up one point which is still a source of confusion? When the regulations were drafted in 1981, was it not the Government's purpose to make it clear, by including the word "non-commercial", that privatisations would not be covered by the regulations? Is it not arguable that the Government's original wording of the regulations failed to implement the terms of the acquired rights directive?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the Attorney-General worried that there could be a substantial volume of claims for compensation under the terms of the Franco vitch judgment, based on the fact that, since 1981, the United Kingdom Government have failed to implement the terms of the acquired rights directive? The Francovitch judgement would be of particular benefit to the many thousands of workers in the public sector who have not had the benefit of the protection of the acquired rights directive when their businesses have been transferred into the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The straight answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is no. I return to some of my original remarks to the Committee. The transfer regulations were made in 1981 to implement the directive. Their scope was expressed so as to be limited to transfers of undertakings in the nature of a commercial venture. Those are the words to which the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>512</span>
referred. That was not intended to restrict the regulations to the private sector or to private undertakings in a narrow sense. Those words were included to reflect the view taken on the scope of article 100 of the treaty—that the Community is an economic one and the treaty is an economic one. The words were put in to emphasise that aspect of the treaty, not, as the hon. Gentleman seems mistakenly to think, to say that they would not apply to privatisation and so on. No one has taken them to have that extended and worrying meaning. That matter has arisen as a result of misunderstandings, perhaps the sort of misunderstandings that led to me being invited to the Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other amendment which requires some detailed explanation is in subsection (3). This makes it explicit that it is not necessary for property to be transferred for the regulations to apply. This amendment is also prompted by EC infraction proceedings. Its effect is to clarify rather than to change the way in which the law applies. For there to be a transfer under the regulations, it is necessary, as I have explained, for sufficient features of an operation to be transferred to amount to a going concern. One of those features is very likely to be the physical assets of the undertaking, others will be the employees, the customer base, and so forth. But no single one of these is essential for there to be a transfer. The case law makes it clear that the overall sum of what is transferred determines whether there has been a transfer of an undertaking. It is the overall picture which has to be considered. At the same time, it is also clear that ownership of the assets does not need to be transferred. Both the directive and the regulations are concerned only with the employment relationship, and it is the change of employer which is relevant, not a change in ownership of the assets being transferred. Transfer of assets can be an indication that the undertaking is being transferred, and, indeed, it may be a strong indication. But some decisions of our domestic courts—for example, the Seligman decision—have suggested wrongly that unless the assets are transferred there can be no transfer of an undertaking. This is mistaken and this amendment makes that clear. This has always been the case and it is now made explicit in the amendment in subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope this explanation has helped to clarify the meaning and effect of subsections (2) and (3), which are relatively limited technical changes required to ensure that the wording of the regulations more closely follows the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>513</span>
impression that he thought that the right hon. and learned Gentleman had given way to him. The hon. Gentleman is making a speech and whether anyone wants to intervene is a decision not for the hon. Member who is on his feet but for the hon. Member who wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I am grateful for your guidance, Mr. Knox. These procedures are new to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to two clauses which have caused confusion in the United Kingdom, particularly in the context of regulation 7, which excludes occupational pensions. It would be helpful if the Government could clarify whether there was a legal basis for regulation 7 being excluded from the original European directive. If not, on what basis did the Government reach that conclusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[SIR MICHAEL NEUBERT 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>The Committee would be interested to know whether or not some of the current pension scandals, particularly the Maxwell scandal, could have been partially averted by the clause being amended or excluded from the original regulations. We need to consider those important points of principle.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Attorney-General</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) raises issues that are of importance and interest to the Committee. Knowing of your musical background, Sir Michael, when I made my main speech, I tried to slow my remarks to a rallentando, in the hope that hon. Members who wanted to intervene would take the hint. I am pleased to intervene in the hon. Gentleman's speech in order to clarify the issue that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful to mention the amendments set out in clause 26(4). Regulation 7 provides that the provisions in contracts of employment and collective agreements relating to occupational pension schemes are not transferred. It was never intended that the exclusion should range wider than that in the directive, which excludes employees' rights to old age, invalidity or survivors benefits. However, it has been suggested that, where occupational pension schemes deal with other matters, such as redundancy rights, those rights could also be excluded. That would mean that, were he transferred, an employee would technically be entitled to redundancy payment, even though his employment was continuous. That should not happen. Nevertheless, the regulations require clarification, which subsection (4) provides by limiting the exclusion expressly to benefits for old age, invalidity or survivors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be clear from my remarks—I picked my words carefully in order to focus properly on subsection (4)—that the amendments do not bear on the wider issues relating to the case of the late Robert Maxwell. The amendments seek to cut out any possible entitlement to redundancy payment that could arise from the regulations, as originally drafted. It was obviously nonsense and it is desirable that it should be clarified. I hope that helps the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for that reply. It seems to show that the Government still intend to allow an incoming employer to seek to gain ownership of any surplus that is left in a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>
pension scheme. As a matter of principle, that is entirely wrong. The regulations could have been tightened to prevent that from happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Attorney-General may be aware of a recent case in the Chancery division, GEC 	<i>v.</i> Plessey Pension Fund et al, which may not have come to trial had the regulations been drawn considerably tighter. I realise that other pieces of legislation are fundamental to my point, but the Attorney-General came to the Committee to explain the picture in the round from a legal standpoint. The Government should take a fresh look at that point.

Regulation 11 concerns the failure to inform or consult. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] I notice that the Attorney-General is leaving. We have driven him away. He has had enough. A note was passed to me asking whether I would fancy being represented by him in court. I think not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that different interpretations are placed on regulation 11 elsewhere in Europe. That has given rise to cases in which workers in the United Kingdom were disadvantaged, because of the lack of harmonisation up to the highest standard. It is a pity that the Attorney-General has left the Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can I explore the issue a bit further?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I grant the Government that other pieces of legislation need to be considered, but there are examples of workers in other countries being consulted at a substantially earlier stage because of the structure of the law in their countries. A particular example concerns a purchase by Unilever plc which was covered by the transfer regulations. The subsidiary was being purchased in the Netherlands. The work force there had advance notification before the work force in the United Kingdom. The regulations need to be tightened up. There should be harmonisation to the highest standard. We should not try to disadvantage the British work force. That is yet another argument for considering what the Attorney-General described as an economic Community from a social standpoint as well. Hon. Members who were in the Chamber during the last few hours of yesterday will have heard several comments on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government need to have a fresh think about the implications of the regulations in the context of the Companies Act 1989 for my latter comments and, for my previous comments, in terms of the legislation and regulations governing the conduct of occupational pensions. In both areas, there are substantial disadvantages. I do not believe that the Government deliberately intend to disadvantage British workers—although perhaps I am being too kind. I think that the amendments could help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall discuss later clauses dealing more specifically with some of the issues that I have raised. I rose to make a general point about pensions in the presence of the Attorney-General because there is a clear disadvantage. This is not a European-wide issue; it is specifically associated with the United Kingdom. The issue is recognised by the Government as being problematic and I wanted the Attorney-General's views on how it could be resolved. Unfortunately, he gave me no hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It has been said that there is always a good turn-out for a public hanging. The Committee Room was bursting at the seams this morning. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, who admits that he is prone to exaggeration, was on the gallows this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that clause 26 does not alter the legal position, but some of the issues should be debated and I shall pursue amendment No. 183. I hope that it will become clear during the debate whether it will be necessary to press that amendment to a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot commend amendment No. 181, which is a transparent spoiling device and amendment No. 178 must be rejected, not least because it would be impossible to define an identifiable economic unit reliably or consistently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is topical to resist the laws that are forced upon us by Europe while the House is sitting in Committee and considering the European Communities (Amendment) Bill. The directive which the Committee is scrutinising today is badly flawed and far from clear. Clause 26 and the Bill before us draw attention to a highly complex legal problem relating to TUPE, contracting out of TUPE and acquired rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we have the opportunity to help the courts, companies, employers and Government Departments by defining more clearly in clause 26 how the law might operate and also by defining what constitutes a going concern and a transfer—and, more importantly, what does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 26 implements European Community directive 77/187, which was issued in 1977. The directive provides that if any staff are transferred from one company to another as part of a takeover or other transfer, their existing terms, conditions, salary and union negotiation rights are transferred with them. The transferred rights may include a specified level of redundancy pay, physical working conditions, break times, general working practices and perhaps protection against compulsory redundancy, such as the automatic right to an industrial tribunal hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive will prevent modernisation of our industries and services and will condemn the United Kingdom to being an industrial backwater with falling standards of service and increased costs. It will prevent us from being effective competitors in the international market, which we must be if we are to maintain jobs in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1981 the Government's interpretation of the directive was that it applied only to commercial transfers, not to non-commercial transfers. That distinction precluded any public sector transfer. Amendment No. 183 would enshrine in clause 26 the legal advice that was given in 1981 by defining specifically the exclusion of contracts for the provision of services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It may help him and the hon. Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson) if I make absolutely clear what the position is. There is nothing that we can add to the clause which would have the effect of amending or altering the terms of the directive. Indeed, the courts regard the directive as their source. Even if we added to clause 26 material of the sort suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point, the courts would look at the directive and overturn any legislative provision made by this House that relates to the terms of the European directive. My hon. Friend is seeking to change the terms of the directive, which it is beyond the power of this House to do by passing legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indebted to the Minister for that advice, which I accept. Throughout the 1980s, hundreds of local authorities, health authorities and Government Departments let contracts worth billions of pounds to private companies under the protection of the tacit interpretation given by the Government in 1981. For example, the Local Government Act 1988 obliged more than 400 local authorities to seek competitive tenders for grounds maintenance, refuse collection, vehicle maintenance, street cleansing, leisure management, cleaning and catering contracts and other functions. That market today is worth approximately £2 billion a year. Compulsory competitive tendering has saved the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds over the years and has released money for the national health service to improve patient care and to increase the number of patients treated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman admit that because compulsory competitive tendering takes place in highly labour-intensive areas, such as cleaning and catering in hospitals, in which wages make up most of the cost of providing the service, the so-called savings to the public purse have, more often than not, been made at the expense of already low-paid workers? Those workers have seen their hours and their pay cut and their entitlement to sick pay and holiday pay cut. After long years of service at the same hospital, their general standard of living has been decimated by compulsory competitive tendering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that for one moment. In my local hospital, the number of patients treated has been increased by 40 per cent. during the past 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The real beneficiaries of those savings are the people who are now employed in undertaking contracts to clean hospitals and provide other services, as well as the additional number of patients who are treated in hospitals.

Many companies sought to take advantage of the opportunity offered by compulsory competitive tendering and won contracts all over Britain. Many of them were small companies run by former local government staff and managers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to check that I heard the hon. Gentleman correctly. Did I hear him say that the beneficiaries of compulsory competitive tendering were the work force that provides the services? Will he tell us what sort of world he lives in? The effects of compulsory competitive tendering are precisely as I have just described them: lower wages, poorer pay and conditions, fewer hours, less entitlement to holiday. Can the hon. Gentleman tell me how he arrived at his conclusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to say to the hon. Lady that those workers were the beneficiaries.

The Minister of State said elsewhere that clause 26 would not impact upon public sector service contracting. That is not the unequivocal view of many trade unions, local authorities, health authorities and other Government departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Mr. Knox. That has been made clear to the Committee in a number of examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point, he must not misrepresent what I have said. I have never said that clause 26 would have no impact upon competitive tendering. I have made it clear that all that clause 26 does is to make clear the position that has always obtained in relation to the application of TUPE as part of the competitive tendering process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that further explanation from the Minister. Since the Bill was introduced in the Commons, the impact on the market has been profound, whatever the Minister says. Unions have seized upon it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>518</span>
to spread uncertainty, to muddy the waters. They have pursued a malicious campaign in an attempt to damage CCT. They have been supported in their efforts by the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle), for instance. NUPE, NALGO and the TGWU have issued notices of grievance to hundreds of companies holding service contracts in the public sector. The trade unions are also bringing intense pressure to bear on local authorities and health authorities to include a transfer of undertakings clause within all tender documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of this calculated confusion, spread by unions in a tactical battle, the Welsh Office has written to health authorities in the Province advising them to suspend contracting, pending clarification of the legal issues. We heard about that from the Attorney-General this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Foreign Office has suspended market testing. The Treasury Solicitor has written to the Central Office of Information saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I cannot confidently advise you that either the UK regulations or the acquired rights directive does not apply."</p></blockquote>
Local and health authorities are inserting TUPE clauses into contract specifications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the hon.

Are they not being assisted in this misinformation and dreadful cause by CAPITOL, Capital Catering Management Services Ltd., who wrote to everyone and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are concerned this will bring about the early demise of the Government's highly successful Compulsory Competitive Tendering (CCT) programme."</p></blockquote>
I presume that he would like to condemn that company as an outrageous company that spreads malicious lies and disinformation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to assist everyone by clarifying clause 26. I suggest that amendment No. 183 does just that and would welcome the support of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) for my move.

I trust that the Attorney-General's statement today will serve to calm fears and to reassure people and organisations about the effect of clause 26 on compulsory competitive tendering, the citizens charter, privatisation and market testing.

I feel sure that hon. Members wish to do what their French counterparts would certainly seek to do—attempt to frustrate inappropriate European directives which improperly impinge on national legislation. The principles of subsidiarity, so skilfully won for the nation by John Major at Maastricht, should be brought to bear—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did I hear the hon. Gentleman refer to the Prime Minister by name? In any case, subsidiarity is not relevant to our discussions, unless one alludes briefly to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just a brief allusion, Mr. Knox. I am thankful once more for your guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom's economy is different from most of our European partners' economies. Many of our public institutions traditionally provide their own services,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>519</span>
which does not happen in the rest of europe. We can rightfully claim, therefore, to be a special case, and should apply the principles of subsidiarity accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I do not want to keep intervening in his speech, but it is important that he appreciate that the House cannot alter the terms of the directive, and we cannot make statements about our views on subsidiarity. Were we to do so, we would not only breach the directive's terms, but we would make no difference to judgments made by the courts, which look to the directive for guidance and would strike out anything to the contrary contained in the Bill, or Act, if it is passed. It is important that my hon. Friend and other Committee members realise that in order to understand the dilemma faced by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am indebted to my hon. Friend the Minister for that further clarification. I only want to apply the advances secured in respect of subsidiarity by the Prime Minister at Maastricht; I do not want to amend the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned earlier, the Department of the Environment thought that the Employment Act 1981 provided that the directive did not apply to local authority contracts because they were not commercial activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past few years, however, several court cases have begun to swing the argument away from and against the private sector and in favour of the vested interests of public sector unions. I would like to be assured that some of the lower court decisions, mentioned today by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, were wrong. I welcome the firmer guidance on interpretation that we received this morning from the Law Officer, most notably in the case brought by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education against the Secretary of State for Employment. The High Court held that the union's staff, being transferred from local education authority control to that of the further education corporations, were protected by the acquired rights directive, despite the fact that it was a public sector, non-commercial organisation. The implications of that case need careful review by the Law Officer. I would like further advice on the implications of that case and other such cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were the Bill to amend the wording of the 1981 Act, so that non-commercial, public-sector contracts were placed within the scope of the acquired rights directive 77/187, the costs of private firms bidding for contracts would be drastically increased. Why should they bother to bid if they are restricted by the directive's broader definition, which would prevent them from making the improvements in efficiency and effectiveness that compulsory competitive tendering aims to achieve?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Spellar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Efficiency and effectiveness are words that have been used, not just in our debate but in other debates in other Committees. Could the hon. Gentleman define what he means by them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My intention is to imply that the services would be carried out at a lower cost to the taxpayer, who would benefit from more services of better quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way at this critical point in the debate. Efficiency means a range of things besides cost—it also means the efficient use of resources. In other words, if companies paid no wages, they would be able to provide a lower-cost service, but that would not be a more efficient use of resources. The key question is whether the companies are managing resources more efficiently or whether they are doing that by cutting wages. The hon. Gentleman should examine the auditors' report on that to see how they use the word "efficiency."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with part of what the hon. Gentleman has said. Indeed, it is because the new service contracts let to private organisations are operated more efficiently, with more effective working practices, that savings have been made and passed on to the general public. I would guess that there are ways to make working practices in the mines more efficient—if the National Union of Mineworkers would allow that—thereby reducing the price of coal and enabling more mines to be kept open. I am surprised, Mr. Knox, that you have not yet called me to order, but I shall return to my speech before that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several authorities see in clause 26 either the potential costs involved or an opportunity to frustrate compulsory competitive tendering by retaining services and contracts in-house and suspending their compulsory competitive tendering programmes. Leeds city council, which we heard about earlier, will issue no further tenders until 1994 and that will rob the people of Leeds of their money and of improved services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recognise that Leeds council sees clause 26 as an excuse for suspending the compulsory competitive tendering process? It certainly is not a reason for doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to the hon. Gentleman carefully. He listed the effects that uncertainty about the TUPE regulations has caused in Departments and in bodies involved with compulsory competitive tendering, yet his right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General tried to persuade us earlier that the regulations had always been applied in this way and that nothing had changed. Will he explain the sudden panic in the Government and among others, if nothing has changed since the regulations were passed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the hon. Lady must have left the Committee Room when I explained that the unions have started to run a campaign using the Bill to muddy the waters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"The resources of all our unions will be combined to fight the threat posed"</p></blockquote>

	<br><blockquote><p>"by contracting out. To that end there have already been a number of strikes in various departments."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>521</span>
Clause 26 is being used to draw attention to the fact that the unions are completely opposed to the sound principle of competitive tendering. I hope that that substantiates my hon. Friend's claims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the expression is: QED.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oswestry district council is preparing a case for judicial review of the Department of the Environment's section 14 notice, which has charged that council with anti-competitive behaviour and orders it to re-tender a refuse collection contract. The Department stated that the new contract should
	<br><blockquote><p>"omit any reference in tender documentation to a successful private contractor having to take on the DSO's workforce under their present terms and conditions of service."</p></blockquote>
It seems that the Department of the Environment is issuing a section 14 notice requiring a council to do what the Department of Employment could be interpreted—if we are not careful—as obliging it in law not to do. Clearly, there is confusion and uncertainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 183 endeavours to cast light on the interpretation of clause 26 and to prevent it from damaging compulsory competitive tendering and fettering market testing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another crucial factor is that the Council of Ministers is to consider a new acquired rights directive this year. That would replace the old directive issued in 1977. Drafts of the new schedule are expected to be available in the near future. To pass into European law, the new directive must have the support of every member state, so the United Kingdom can play a pivotal role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should consider any new TUPE legislation with scepticism. I believe that such legislation should be resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter, to which I shall allude briefly, is whether the 1977 directive could be applied retrospectively. Most contractors have assumed that it cannot, but it must be noted that there is no time limit on EC legislation such as this. As the Minister said, it would not be possible to pass a retrospective law, even in clause 26, to give retrospective protection to any company for previous contracts. That issue has not been missed by the trade unions' legal departments, which have been mischievously developing the theme, although the hon. Member for Wallasey does not accept that. We have the opportunity today to assist the courts in interpreting the issue by accepting amendment No. 183 or a similar device.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does my hon. Friend mean when he asks whether the directive could be applied retrospectively? The TUPE regulations have operated since 1981, when they were made. My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General explained that the effect of clause 26 is one of illumination, not of changing the terms of those regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the Minister has further comforted companies. He will know that the unions are running a campaign on this issue. I trust that the Attorney-General's comments will also have comforted companies being challenged by the unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
Amendment No. 183 wants it specified that the provision of services is not a relevant transfer. Equally, the Minister may find a means of specifying that the transfer of undertakings should not include contracting out by companies, by Government and by local Government. That would also be an acceptable device and I recommend that it be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister claims that these ideas already apply and that all is well, surely he can find a way to enshrine them in clause 26 of the Bill so that they can be clarified, comfort can be given and confidence in the marketplace can be promoted. We know that there is confusion and a lack of confidence in the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that all hon. Members will support my attempt to resist the excesses of inappropriate European legislation and, thereby, to protect the jobs of people working in the various industries that are involved. I want the Committee's support for amendment No. 183 in order to sanitise clause 26, and I apologise for using such a remote pun.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only conclude from amendment No. 183 that the hon. Gentleman was not listening to the legal advice given by the Attorney-General. As I understood the Attorney-General's remarks, he made it clear that it is possible that compulsory competitive tendering contracts can be caught by the acquired rights directive and will indeed be covered by the 1981 regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Attorney-General made it clear that that is European law. As a result of litigation in the European Court of Justice, we know that the acquired rights directive already covers compulsory competitive tendering. It is not possible for the Committee, or the House, to accept the amendment because it would result in our domestic law being in direct violation of our obligations under the treaty of Rome and under the acquired rights directive. The hon. Member for Castle Point and other Conservative Members may be concerned about the Attorney-General's remarks. Many companies in Britain that have been involved in the compulsory competitive tendering process will be alarmed by them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is not in a position to accept amendment No. 183, because we cannot make laws that directly violate our obligations under the treaty of Rome or that result in domestic law conflicting directly with any directive established under that treaty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Castle Point spoke on the virtues of compulsory competitive tendering. If I were to speak in opposition to his comments, I should be slightly wide of the amendment. However, there is a division of opinion in the Committee about the merits or otherwise of compulsory competitive tendering. That is not the purpose of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be concerned with the broad thrust of clause 26. I listened with rapt attention to the Attorney-General's words. It is clear that we are not just clarifying the 1981 regulations but dealing with a substantive issue of employment law. We are confirming in British law the recent opinions of the European Court of Justice about the breadth of the acquired rights directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not tidying up the 1981 regulations, but we are admitting that they were originally drafted in a way that does not comply with the acquired rights directive. I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>523</span>
reminded of the remarks of the then Minister when he introduced the regulations. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am recommending them with a remarkable lack of enthusiasm".</p></blockquote>
He also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have done a great deal to mitigate some of the worst effects of the directive."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 December 1981; Vol. 14, c. 680–97.]</p></blockquote>
I conclude from looking at the orginal regulations that by litigation, the Minister conceded that the directive was being neutered. The provisions drafted in such a way as not to apply to certain key elements of the Government's economic policy; one of the remaining key elements is compulsory competitive tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The historical records are a clear admission that the Government originally drafted the regulations to exclude compulsory competitive tendering. As a result of litigation in the European court, we discovered that compulsory competitive tendering was capable of being brought within the terms of the acquired rights directive. Today, the Attorney-General told us that, after all the events of the past 12 years, we are obliged to spell it out in British law that compulsory competitive tendering can now be covered by the 1981 regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is another example of the merry-go-round on which we have been riding over the past 12 years. Conservative Members have trumpeted the cause of subsidiarity. That is their programme; many Opposition Members agree with that and wish that the Government would extend it to all their schemes. But if we were to listen to Conservative Members, we should be convinced that the Government were resisting the tide of European social legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will concede that, in this instance, the Government are not resisting and that they are bringing British law into line with the terms of the directive. The Government have accepted the competence and jurisdiction of the European Commission in those areas. Although the hon. Member for Castle Point tried to argue the case, neither the Committee nor the Government are involved in a heroic campaign to resist the tide of creeping European competence. The Government have accepted European competence in this area. The purpose of the clause is to confirm European competence and the jurisdiction of the European Court because they have no other choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government know perfectly well that if they do not amend the 1981 regulations they will be in deep trouble with the European Court of Justice. The Committee is unlikely to be impressed, therefore, by protestations of Opposition Members about resisting European competence and jurisdiction. We have accepted European competence and jurisdiction and Conservative Members will support the clause, although, to judge by the expression on their faces, with extreme reluctance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Castle Point—amendment No. 183 is a good example—Conservative Members are clearly concerned about what they are being asked to support. The Attorney-General tried to reassure them—and, I suspect, a wider audience outside the Committee—that there is nothing to worry about and that the Government are simply confirming existing practice and procedure. We know that that is not true. We know, for example, that, when the health authorities were advised about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
implications of compulsory competitive tendering in 1983, they were told that the TUPE regulations did not apply to the contracting out of health service provision. Now we are told that the Government had always understood that compulsory competitive tendering did not come within the scope of the 1981 regulations. The Government's position is clearly inconsistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a lawyer, I can understand why the Government need to defend that difficult position. When the regulations were drafted in 1981, despite what the Attorney-General said it was clearly with a view to excluding compulsory competitive tendering from the scope of the acquired rights directive. That was manifestly the Government's intention. Compulsory competitive tendering could not be made cost effective and could not produce the savings that the Government hoped for without ensuring that workers did not have the protection of the acquired rights directive. That made it easy to reduce terms and conditions and to cut wages. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey made clear in an earlier intervention, it was that which produced savings for the taxpayer, because those services are predominantly labour-intensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is pathetic to hear the Government claim that the 1981 regulations were designed to apply to the practice of compulsory competitive tendering, which is what they would like us to believe today. There is no evidence that even Conservative Members believe that that is true. Conservative Members and many companies were convinced, as a result of advice from Government Ministers and Government Departments, that the TUPE regulations did not apply to compulsory competitive tendering. That was their whole purpose. That is the mitigation to which the Minister referred in the House in 1981.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening to the extraordinary conspiracy theory which the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) is setting out for the Committee. He seems to be arguing that the regulations were in some way rigged in 1981 to deal with the Government's requirements for compulsory competitive tendering. I have a problem with that argument; compulsory competitive tendering did not exist in 1981.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification, but in truth that is a disingenuous contribution to our proceedings. There is no doubt that the Government clearly had compulsory competitive tendering in their sights when the regulations were being prepared. Surely the Minister is not going to tell the Committee and industry that compulsory competitive tendering was suddenly invented some time between 1981 and 1983. The Government had been talking about it for some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might like to ask the Minister the date of publication of the Coopers and Lybrand report on compulsory competitive tendering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will provide information to the Committee at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can return to the substance of our discussion, the kernel of the argument against the amendment is one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0640">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
which, I am sure, will be put by the Minister in due course. The Committee cannot accept the amendment because that would directly violate the treaty of Rome. There would also be tension between British domestic law and the employment rights directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most interesting point about the amendment is that it reflects the desire of Conservative Members to ensure that compulsory competitive tendering is not affected by the regulations. Sadly, the Committee cannot entertain that possibility. There is immense inconsistency among Conservative Members. I suspect that the Attorney-General was trying to persuade Conservative members of the Committee to support the clause. He is trying to assure them that there is nothing to worry about and that the provision has to be accepted. Some Conservative members of the Committee want dramatic changes. Sadly for the hon. Gentleman and, I suspect, gladly for many hundreds of thousands of British workers, those changes are not possible. I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, I said that I thought that our employment legislation should be made in the United Kingdom so that it meets United Kingdom circumstances. The acquired rights directive is a good reason for that proposal. The United Kingdom has a tranche of legislation that is far more complex than it need be. We are relatively powerless to simplify it because it has to accord with the wording of the directive, which does not reflect our domestic circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive was introduced by the previous Labour Government but it had to be implemented by the legislation of the Conservative Government who followed them. I do not think that a Conservative Government, with their commitment to subsidiarity, would have yielded that area of jurisdiction to the Community in the first place. The debate that we have had today shows how wise we should have been if we had not done so. However, there is no point crying over spilt milk. We have to deal with the reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no problem with the change in the legislation that was introduced by the regulations, other than the consequent complexities of the phrasing of the legislation.

The change is neither unfair nor a great big deal. Until the regulations were introduced, people who worked for an unincorporated business were treated, on the transfer of that business, in a different way from people who worked for a limited company whose shares were sold. On the transfer of shares, all the terms and conditions of employment of the people working in the business were automatically transferred. However, the person who acquired that business or company was not prevented from changing the terms and conditions of employment of his employees later. When a company's shares were acquired by another group, changes would usually be made to the terms and conditions of employment. For many companies, it made no sense for their employees to have different terms and conditions of employment. The changing of terms and conditions of employment involved costs. Those costs might have been incurred because of redundancies, or because previous rights of employees were bought out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No equivalent cost arose for unincorporated businesses. Before a business was transferred, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>526</span>
employees were often made redundant. Not long afterwards, the acquirer of the business would employ them all back again. That cost was often unnecessary because, in many cases, the businesses prospered in the hands of the new employers and more employees had to be recruited. That resulted not just in a loss of rights for the individuals concerned but in redundancy costs, incurred in the first place, becoming unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TUPE regulations forced the vendors and purchasers of unincorporated businesses to behave in the same way as limited companies by identifying the costs of the changes proposed, and incorporating those costs in the commercial transaction. That is not unsatisfactory, nor should it be pretended that TUPE makes it impossible for the acquirers of businesses to change the terms and conditions of the employees whom they inherit. TUPE transfers the costs of such a transaction from the vendors to the purchasers and, in most circumstances, that would be reflected in the purchase price, in the terms of the contract that was being negotiated or in the terms of the tender price for the service. That is no big deal, although, from a lawyer's point of view, the documentation required to implement such transactions was far more complicated and, therefore, a burden on business, as it was expensive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concept of TUPE is not the core of the problem. If a coherent business is being transferred, it makes no sense to treat the employees differently from those of a limited liability company. Equally, if no coherent business is being transferred, there is nothing to move on and it is right to start with a clean sheet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The core of the problem is trying to define what is a transfer of a business and what is not, in the sale of assets or the placing of a new contract. That is causing difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that I have not practised in this area of law since I became a Member of Parliament. It seems to me that the broad principles around which a definition of the business is determined have been set out quite well by the courts. Inevitably, some cases will go one way and some another. People will draw upon cases which suit their own circumstances to make political points, but the weight of evidence shows relatively clear definitions, given that the core of the problem is that instead of defining legislation in terms of our own domestic traditions, we try to shape legislation that reflects a European directive. Our difficulty today is that the Labour Government were not as concerned about subsidiarity as we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The crucial point this morning was when the Attorney-General said that there will be no real change to the application of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations, but clarification that they should always have applied to any transfer within or without the public sector, as appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems odd that in 10 years the two main players—the Department of the Environment and the Department of Health—have consistently given no guidance on the application of TUPE to compulsory competitive tendering. The Department of Health has gone so far as to spend money on legal fees to defend cases before employment appeal tribunals to try to deny the existence of TUPE.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the first Departments to recognise TUPE was the Department of the Employment. When the skills training agency was transferred, the then Minister arranged for letters to be sent to all employees of the agency stating that their employment had been transferred from the civil service to the company and that in accordance with TUPE conditions of employment their
	<br><blockquote><p>"past service as a civil servant counts as part of your continuous period of employment with the Company."</p></blockquote>
The Department of Employment said that TUPE applied but at the same time the Department of the Environment and the Department of Health were trying to say that it did not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is talking nonsense. There is all the difference in the world between a Department saying that TUPE need not necessarily apply in every case—for example, in respect of compulsory competitive tendering—and saying that it will not apply in any case. It is conceivable for the Department of Employment to say that TUPE applies in one case when at the same time the Department of the Environment may say that it is not necessarily the case that TUPE will apply when compulsory competitive tendering occurs in local authorities. The hon. Gentleman should not try to make the sort of mischief of which my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point complained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his usual sharp intervention. Is it not the case that in the health service guidance on contracting out, dating back to 1983, there is no reference to TUPE? Is it not also the case that the Department of Health has spent tens of thousands of pounds on legal fees to argue at employment tribunals that the regulations do not apply to contracting out? With the best will in the world, that suggests that the Department takes the view that the regulations do not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that in 1981 there was no compulsory competitive tendering. He may or may not be aware that the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980 introduced compulsory competitive tendering into the work of direct service organisations on housing maintenance, building work and road maintenance. That Act was the forerunner of the present legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the one person who seems to have been consistent during the past six years in his attitude to TUPE regulations and competitive tendering is the Treasury Solicitor. The Treasury always have the final word on Government matters, so perhaps it would have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
been better to have had the Treasury Solicitor with us. When giving advice to the Central Office of Information on the contracting out of photocopying services, which is hardly a major operation, he said that there
	<br><blockquote><p>"is increasing unease about tribunal and EAT decisions that the contracting out of services does not attract the application of TUPE. This is principally because of decisions of the ECJ on the Acquired Rights Directive which TUPE implements. These suggest that essentially all that has to be shown is that there is a transfer of an economic entity"—</p></blockquote>
not necessarily a commercial venture in the terms that the hon. Member for Castle Point is so desperate to impress on the Committee—
	<br><blockquote><p>"i.e. that the operation of the entity is being continued by the new employer with the same economic or similar activities. The emphasis is on the change in identity of the employer and the purpose behind the directive, which is to protect the rights of employees who are being taken over by a new employer.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>You will no doubt be aware that, despite recent tribunal and EAT cases, the government does not rely on the qualification in TUPE that the undertaking being transferred should be a commercial venture."</p></blockquote>
It is not clear when that conversion took place, but the Treasury Solicitor has decided that it has. He goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It cannot be assumed that a service carried on within government is free of TUPE considerations for that reason alone."</p></blockquote>
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implication is that, undoubtedly, tens of thousands of people have been wrongfully dismissed since 1982 and that tens of thousands of people are entitled to enormous compensation. According to current law—although a quick Act could be rushed through to change it—those costs stand to be borne by the contractors that have taken over services and gained their profits by the sacking of workers and the introduction of dreadfully low wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why the campaign is running. It is not a valid reflection of the truth to suggest that, on the day the Bill was published, all of a sudden the trade union movement decided, "'Ey up lads, we're gonna have a bit of fun with this. Let's get a campaign going." There are industrial tribunal cases going back seven years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not have put it better myself. That is exactly what happened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I am being complimented or insulted. Far be it from me to comment on how Keighley has benefited from being taken over by Bradford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The malicious disinformation—that the trade union movement is trying to destroy the private contracting sector—is just that. Trade unions exist to represent employees. Tens of thousands of workers have been abused by the misapplication of the original directive and by the Government's idea that public sector services were non-commercial ventures and, therefore, outside the 1981 regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although dressed up differently, this has been a capitulation. This will almost certainly be the death knell of compulsory competitive tendering as it is currently practised. I do not necessarily share my colleagues joy about that because I admire the ability of the Conservative Government to devise new ways and means to achieve the same objective. I have no doubt—I see the Minister nodding—that high-powered minds and hand-picked brains are at work to devise them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>529</span>
If we consider the interventions by the Secretary of State for the Environment who has issued notices about anti-competitive activity, we note that in almost every case the local authority has tried to impose on a prospective new employer the cost that the local authority has to bear. That has been described as anti-competitive and hence illegal, even though it appears to be in line with the acquired rights directive. The misworded 1981 regulations appear to have been overlooked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was a shame that the Attorney-General had to leave the Committee. Several questions have been left in the air; perhaps they will have to be dealt with in another way. The advice of the Committee, which will no doubt be transmitted to the outside world, is that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 try to ensure across all areas, be they public or private sector, that workers have rights, that they cannot be trampled on, that their wages cannot be pinned down and that they cannot be disgraced. That must be to the benefit of society as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been treated to an extraordinary sitting. There are two strands of thought as to the implications of the extension of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981. First, if we are to believe the Attorney-General, everything is as it always was but the regulations also apply to some areas of the public sector. If that is what we should believe has been going on, it is somewhat tarnished by the other strand of thought expressed by Back-Bench Conservative Members: that this could well mean the end of compulsory competitive tendering and that therefore the extension of the TUPE regulations has to be nipped in the bud and stopped so that compulsory competitive tendering can proceed. This interpretation is more accurate. The evidence for that is, first, that the number of people in the Room watching our proceedings—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no Public Gallery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My apologies, Mr. Knox. I sometimes do not believe my eyes. This is a significant occasion. The implications of an extension of the acquired rights directive is causing a great deal of anguish in some Government circles and in some areas of the private contracting sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was demonstrated in the interesting contribution from the hon. Member for Castle Point who thought that this was so significant that it had to be destroyed before it emerged in order to save the sector he likes so much. He was so carried away that he moved an illegal amendment. Despite interventions from his own Members, he carried on moving his illegal amendment. He managed to estrange his own Front Bench as well as to raise the blood pressure of Opposition Members who do not agree with his rosy view of the effects of compulsory competitive tendering on real people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a technical debate, starting with the Attorney-General. I should like to translate the debate into real life and examine the effects of compulsory competitive tendering on ordinary men and women, ordinary people in the work force, who have been at the rough end of compulsory competitive tendering and its effects in the last decade. They hope that because of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>530</span>
treatment that has been meted out to them they may have some redress in law and that they might not be subject to such drastic treatment in future. That is why we have interpreted the debate as significant rather than as no big deal—that is, the Government attempting to bluff it out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I told the hon. Member for Castle Point, compulsory competitive tendering relies on a vast reduction in hours and in hourly rates of pay, and on wiping out well-established pay and conditions and holiday and sick pay entitlements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, I worked for the Confederation of Health Service Employees before I became a Member of Parliament. In that sector, many workers have been detrimentally affected by compulsory competitive tendering—80,000 ancillary workers have lost their jobs, and many have had their hours cut to such an extent that they no longer have access to the limited employment protections which the Government have deigned to put on the statute book. In the pursuit of their dogma of deregulation, the Government have removed many employment protections. People in the ancillary and catering sectors of hospitals, for example, have had their hours reduced below 16 and have lost their access to some employment rights; others have had their hours further reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have met many long-standing ancillary workers in hospitals. Some have worked in hospitals for 20 years, and before compulsory competitive tendering was introduced, were regarded by nursing staff, patients and managers as an important part of the health care team, simply because they often had time to talk to patients.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady and I am listening carefully to her comments about compulsory competitive tendering in the health service. In my previous incarnation, I was a Health Minister north of the border. Both north and south of the border, in 80 per cent. of compulsory competitive tendering cases, contracts have been won by the in-house team, led sometimes by trade union officials—some of them from the union with which the hon. Lady was associated. Is the hon. Lady saying that those people were misled into taking action to their own detriment by their union leaders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that the Minister seems so ignorant of the workings of the free market which he advocates so passionately. Those who led those in-house tenders were between a rock and a hard place—should they try to maintain as much as they could of what was there before, or should they give up the ghost and throw their members to the wolves in some of the less reputable firms that were applying for the tenders?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree not only that hours and wages were cut, but that the efficiencies to which the hon. Member for Castle Point referred often forced workers who received basic pay into depending on family credit, income support and housing benefit? The efficiencies to which the hon. Gentleman alluded in one sector may be met by Government expenditure in another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has gone on during the previous decade has been praised by Conservative Members as a tremendous

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>531</span>
achievement. The significance of today's debate is the effect that the change has had on the work force. Considerable distress and material hardship have been caused to ordinary hard-working men and women, many of whom have given years of service—in ancillary roles, perhaps, but those are as important as any job. It pains and annoys me to hear Conservative Members dismiss the human aspect and the effectiveness, as my hon. Friend the Member for Delyn was saying, of the work force. Cheaper, lower wages and deregulated conditions create inefficiencies in other sectors of the economy which cannot be simply measured in a profit and loss account. The effects are much worse and create more inefficiencies than Conservative Members believe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many firms and individuals have made a very nice profit indeed out of these contracts. Their profits have been made through the suffering of ordinary working men and women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady mentioned the sector that she likes so much. Unlike her, I represent the interests of all people in this country, not just one sector of them. Compulsory competitive tendering benefits people not by depressing wages but by making efficiencies through increased and improved investment in plant and equipment, by changed and better working methods and practices and by different organisation and structures of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wallasey tends to paint a one-sided picture of the changes. Is not she aware that some people affected by those changes have increased their earnings as a result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps those people are managers of companies that have come to cream off the contracts. The work force have not been the beneficiaries of the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that some people who benefit from such contracts are likely to be closely associated with companies that trade in, or close to, the public sector, and management consultants who offer advice to companies that want compulsory competitive tendering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that if the hon. Member for Castle Point had a financial interest in this matter as a management consultant, he would have declared it before he made his contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The extension of the regulations to compulsory competitive tendering offers protection to what has been a vulnerable work force. Rather than condemn trade unions, as Conservative members of the Committee have done, merely for protecting effectively the pay, conditions and interests of their members—the unions' role and reason for existing—I would like to commend their work. The implications of an extension of the regulations are fivefold. First, a new contractor would take over the contract of employment of employees on existing terms and conditions. Mr. Webb was worried about that because, he said, it would take away the point of tendering. Secondly, collective agreements and negotiations by recognised trade unions would also be transferred.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>532</span>
Thirdly and importantly, local authorities which have been forced by the Government to transfer services would not be liable for redundancy payments. Some of my hon. Friends have expressed fears that local authorities would be liable. The burden of those payments would be transferred, quite rightly, to the new purchaser, not the vendor. Fourthly, employers would have the benefit of continuity of employment; and fifthly, any dismissal connected with the transfer would automatically be unfair. If, as the Attorney-General said earlier, all this has applied, thousands of people might have the right to take action and some right to compensation for their treatment over the past decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive provides that collective agreements must remain in force for a year after transfer. The clause does not include a similar provision. Will the Minister clarify whether the clause would be taken to mean that such contracts had to remain in force for a year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive that we signed states that some pension protection will be provided. Again, there is no provision for that in the clause. As we all know, in the light of recent events, pension protection is extremely close to the hearts of many workers because it affects their ability to have a reasonable standard of living during their old age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome today's debate. I support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. The Minister and I are at one in opposing amendment No. 183.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will be keen to get in before we adjourn so I shall limit my remarks. In the words of the Under-Secretary of State for Employment who starts all his speeches in the Committee with, "We have had a very interesting debate." Perhaps that is how his brief begins—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not give the hon. Gentleman a lift if he says that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he will not give me a lift anymore, so I will not pursue the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear to Opposition Members from this morning's very interesting debate that the Government are extremely confused about the implication of what is taking place and how to present that implication. One presentation is the "no big deal" argument made by several Conservative Members. The other presentation has it that contracting out will be extremely difficult, following all this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must take time, once the Committee have dealt with this, to think about the matter and return with a coherent response. My interpretation of their plans, which is shared increasingly by many others who are concerned, is that compulsory competitive tendering, although not dead, is severely disabled. For its continued existence it will require the Government's help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Attorney-General tried to tell us that clause 26 would not affect the 1981 TUPE regulations. If one believes that, one will believe anything, and quite simply we do not. That is a difficult and dangerous line for the Attorney-General to argue. He is saying that since 1981 there has been no change in the law and that the TUPE regulations apply to compulsory competitive tendering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>533</span>
So everything the Government have done since then has been illegal and, furthermore, they know that they have been breaking the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will say that that is not true. But that was the law in 1981. Over the years, the Government have changed their position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us return to that. The Department of Health has imposed a moratorium.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is not intentionally misleading the Committee, but it is nonsense to say that the Government's position on tendering has changed. As I have already said, compulsory competitive tendering did not exist in 1981 when the regulations were introduced. My hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir T. Taylor) asked my noble Friend Lord Waddington, who at the time was the Under-Secretary of State for Employment introducing the regulations, whether an undertaking could
	<br><blockquote><p>"possibly refer to a local authority cleansing department being privatised, or must it be a private business?"</p></blockquote>
Lord Waddington replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It certainly does not have to be a private business."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 7 December 1981; Vol. 14, c. 683.]</p></blockquote>
It was clear from the day the regulations were introduced that competitive tendering by local authorities could fall within the scope of TUPE. It is wrong for the hon. Gentleman to say that the Government's position on the interpretation of the regulations has changed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the 1981 regulations always applied, but the Government tried to give the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>534</span>
impression that they specifically did not apply. No one in the Department of Health, the Scottish Office or the Welsh Office said that TUPE applied. Over the years, we have come to realise that the position must be more explicit. That is what was interesting in the Attorney-General's decision and the Minister's intervention. TUPE has applied since 1981, although the Government have tried to give a different impression. In his recent letter to 	<i>The Guardian</i> the Minister stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, the regulations do not normally apply where local authorities contract out in-house services".</p></blockquote>
That is slightly different from what he has just said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that both positions may be held and that they are not logically inconsistent, because the general regulations may apply, but, in the case of a transfer of an undertaking, they may not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. That is the impression which the Government have always tried to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have just received a note asking me to sit down before 1 o'clock so that the Minister may make a point, so he will not be upset if I raise further points when we return to the matter. It is clear that TUPE applies and has always applied. Court cases, European legislation and the 1986 Spijkers case made it clear that it applies, and I shall return to the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
