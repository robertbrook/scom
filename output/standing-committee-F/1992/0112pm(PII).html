	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 103, in clause 20, page 37, line 42, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>",provided that such variation is fully consistent with the terms of the EC directive".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendment: No. 109 in page 38, line 17, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>", provided that such variation is fully consistent with the terms of the EC directive".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to ensure that the Government do not misuse their power to vary the Bill's terms in a way that would be inconsistent with the European directive, that this part of the Bill is supposed to implement. It is not clear to us whether the Government feel that they would be under any obligation always to remain within the terms of the directive. Perhaps the Minister will tell us how he intends to work under the freedom that he will have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel strongly that the Government need to act in a way that is consistent with the terms of the directive and are worried not that the Government may stick to the directive's minimum requirement but that they will be tempted to make provisions that fall below that level. The Government have been dragged unwillingly into improving maternity and other employment rights by the EC and their record is such that they might wish to use their freedom to escape from European obligations. We are trying to save the Government possible future embarrassment. We would not like them to be hauled before the European Court of Justice because they were implementing measures whose standards fell below those set by the European directive, or were contrary to it. The Government have been in such embarrassing circumstances before. It was clear in our earlier discussions that my hon. Friends were worried about any Government failure fully to implement and that some of their actions were contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that when the Minister replies, he will say that the Government intend to act within the terms of the directive and that they consider that we have a good record on implementing directives that we have agreed to. That may be true of the internal market measures, but I can think of occasions when the Government have not fully implemented directives. The Minister of State is looking at me with complete astonishment, as if such a thing were unimaginable. I shall cite the example of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>348</span>
directive on the cleanliness and quality of bathing water. Only about a dozen United Kingdom beaches qualified under the directive's terms, and yet Luxembourg, which has no coastline, managed to find 29 beaches along river banks and lake shores which qualified. That shows why we are anxious that the Government act in accordance with the European directive. As the United Kingdom has by far the longest coastline of all European Community countries, its failure to implement the directive is even more astonishing. I am glad to say that, because of pressure from European institutions, the Government have had to Change their position and now far more beaches in Britain come within the terms of the relevant European directive. However, it took many years for that to be resolved, and we do want a similar occurrence with the implementation of this directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given her wide experience of European matters, can the hon. Lady explain how the amendments are anything other than what is implied already in law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to stop the Government from making an overt commitment to continue to act within the terms of the European directive. Such clarification would give much assurance, particularly to outside organisations that are worried that the Government may not fully implement the EC directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled the amendment for another reason. The directive forms part of the EC social dimension and was envisaged in the social charter. Since the Government have negotiated a foolish opt-out from the social protocol of the Maastricht treaty, we want to ensure that they continue to act in accordance with the directive, whether or not they are part of the social dimension of the EC in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, we have winkled out the purpose of the amendment, which is to tie this country into the social chapter, even though under the Maastricht agreement and the treaty that we shall implement, we shall not be a party to it or bound by it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not catch everything that the hon. Gentleman said. He started by saying that he had managed to winkle out that information. However, I assure him that I intended all along to make that comment; it was simply a matter of time when I did so. The information does not need to be winkled out of me when it involves attacking the Government for the social opt-out negotiated in Maastricht. That was a foolish decision, even from the Government's view, and is not in the interests of the British people. I am happy to make that point. Assuming that the Maastricht treaty is agreed with the social opt-out in place, will the Government feel able to disregard their responsibility under social legislation that they introduced under pressure from the European Community?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given a few reasons for the importance of the amendment and for the Government making a clear commitment that they will not in future act in a way that is contrary to the terms of the EC directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mclaughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Lady moved the amendment slightly tongue-in-cheek. I assure her that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>349</span>
never contemplate introducing regulations inconsistent with the directive's requirements. Working women make an enormous contribution to the nation's economy and the Government have accepted the directive as a valuable improvement to their employment rights. If it had not been for the successful handling of the United Kingdom presidency by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, the directive would not have been agreed. We made a commitment to various parts of the directive in our manifesto. The United Kingdom is bound by the treaty of Rome to full implementation of Community obligations. It is the Government's policy to honour that commitment, as they honour all international commitments. I hope that other member countries will also abide by that commitment, as there is much concern about compliance with directives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to hear the Minister's assurance regarding the Government's commitment to abide by European legislation. Therefore, I ask him to relate that commitment to other issues arising under the Bill as well as the principle of improved maternity provisions in European legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was somewhat worried about the story of the pregnant-women-at-work directive and its history, which we debated earlier. I am also worried about the statements made by Ministers on this subject in the past two or three years. I refer in particular to the evidence of the Minister's predecessor, the Under-Secretary of State for Education, the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth) given on 22 May 1991 to the Select Committee on the European Communities, Sub-Committee C. The hon. Gentleman stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our view is that the best way forward would be to remove from the draft directive the following elements: maternity pay"—</p></blockquote>
We have discussed that already and know that the Government have not included it in the Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"maternity leave, employment protection and the burden of proof in legal proceedings."</p></blockquote>
That evidence shows that the Government did not simply want to water down the essential elements of maternity provision in the Bill—maternity pay, maternity leave, employment of protection and the burden of proof in legal proceedings—but to remove them altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been discussing the absence of maternity pay provisions in the Bill. We are still at the bottom of the league of European countries for maternity leave. The absence of employment protection provisions will mean that women hoping to enforce the maternity provisions will have no effective access to law or industrial tribunals. As for the burden of proof in legal proceedings, it has been said today that if women are denied their rights under the Bill by their employer, it is up to them to do something about it. So although I welcome what the Minister has said, I do not understand how his commitment to follow European directives links with the Government's evidence to the Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about what was said about the appropriate article of the treaty of Rome under which maternity leave provisions should appear. We were told earlier that the Government were not opposed to improved maternity provisions and that the decision to abstain in the final vote on the directive on pregnant women at work in October 1992 was motivated purely by reservations about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>350</span>
the article to which the directive referred. In other words, the Government did not wish the issue to be seen as one of health and safety. We see no reason why it should not be regarded as an issue of the health, safety and welfare of women at work. But the Government believed that maternity provision was not appropriate for inclusion in health and safety legislation; the Minister stated today that it was much more appropriate in relation to employment protection directives and legislation. Yet the issue of employment rights as opposed to health and safety rights is the one aspect of European legislation and the social chapter that the Government have opted out of. They appear to say that this should be not part of health and safety provision but included in employment protection legislation, which gives them the pretext on which to opt out of the final vote and then claim for themselves the right to divorce and to opt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot have it both ways. Either they wish to stand by their opt out from the social chapter or they want to lay down provisions that we think should be in health and safety legislation. Will the Minister do something about this apparent contradiction? Have the Government now abandoned the view that they expressed to the Select Committee on European Communities on 22 May 1991 that they do not wish these elements to be part of the draft directive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.30pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hoped that the Minister would respond to my hon. Friend. Perhaps I should allow him a few minutes to collect his thoughts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister seems determined to confuse us. He gives the impression that he is keen on the European directive and that the United Kingdom was almost determined to get it through during its presidency while at the same time letting us know that the Government are not keen to have social legislation at European Community level. Indeed, as my hon. Friends and I have shown in our examples, he has seemed keen to sabotage the directive at every stage. I hope that he will respond to the points that we have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the Minister's statement that he will not act outside the scope of the EC directive in a manner that would reduce the protection that the directive affords. None the less, the points that we have raised should be taken seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have dealt seriously with those points. The hon. Member for Northfield whines on with the same arguments that I have answered at other times. I do not think it worthwhile detaining the Committee by repeating yet again what I have already said precisely and clearly. We are implementing the directive according to our manifesto commitment. I shall not listen to a lecture from the hon. Gentleman that we are failing to do that or somehow trying to get round it. If we wished to do that, these clauses would not be in the Bill. That they are there is proof that we intend to implement them, so I see no point in prolonging the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that before the debate ends the Minister will answer the question that I asked instead of one that I did not ask. I made a statement about our belief, and that of many outside the Committee, that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0543">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>351</span>
Government have persistently tried to get out of enshrining these measures and have tried to water them down when they have been unable to get out of incorporating them into legislation. That was a statement of belief rather than a question, as the evidence shows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question is, do the Government now take a different view from that articulated by the Under-Secretary of State for Schools when he gave evidence for the Government to the Select Committee on European Communities on 22 May 1991. He stated clearly that the Government wished not to water down but to remove references to maternity pay, maternity leave, employment protection and the burden of proof in legal proceedings. Will the Minister admit either thay they are to be included because the Government have no way out, in which case they stand by that view, or that they have changed their mind and now think that those references should be included?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before Christmas, I took my son to a pantomime. One of the catchphrases in the show was, "We'd better say it again." For the benefit of the hon. Gentleman, I will say it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I will say it again, simply for the benefit of the hon. Member for Northfield, in the hope that he may be able to understand what I am saying. Had it not been for Britain's presidency of the EC, we should not have reached a common position on this issue and these provisions would not have been in the Bill. On 13 May 1992, the European Parliament adopted amendments to the common position, one of which was to set maternity pay at 80 per cent of pay. The European Parliament took the view that it was undesirable for an agreed formula to equate pregnancy with sickness. That view was supported by the Commission and Italy. A unanimous vote in the Council of Ministers was needed to reject the European Parliament's amendments and to adopt the common position agreed in 1991. The hon. Gentleman's argument that we wanted the proposal not to be agreed under health and safety legislation because we needed unanimity is false and inaccurate. The Bill will greatly enhance the rights of pregnant women in the future. We need no lessons from the Opposition on how to achieve that protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may regret having used the analogy of a pantomime, which may stimulate the fertile imagination of my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's assurances go some way to allaying our anxieties about the clause. However, my hon. Friend made many valid points about the history of the directive and the way in which it was negotiated, which give us great cause for concern about how effectively such directives will be implemented in future. We tabled the amendment as a safeguard, but having listened to the Minister's assurances, I shall not press it to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 104, in page 38, line 2, leave out "fourteen" and insert "eighteen".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>352</span>
There is widespread support among those concerned with maternity rights for the entitlement to 14 weeks leave to be extended to 18 weeks on purely practical grounds. The proposal has the support of such reputable bodies as the Maternity Alliance, the Daycare Trust, the Equal Opportunities Commission and Working for Childcare. It has the singular merit of coinciding with the present period laid down for entitlement to statutory maternity pay with which the Government have, presumably, been satisfied until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot do better than to spell out in detail what the various groups have said. Many women choose to leave work 14 weeks before their baby is due, but that is a rather imprecise period, as everyone knows. The McCrea study, carried out for the Policy Studies Institute, showed that 48 per cent of women in the survey had stopped work by the 11th week before their baby was due and 37 per cent of women said that they had stopped work because of illness, tiredness or because they did not feel up to working any longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new scheme, if a woman leaves work 11 weeks before the baby is due, she will be entitled to only three weeks maternity leave after the birth. Most people would agree that that could be detrimental to the health of the baby and the mother. Because of the imprecise guestimates on gestation, some women might have even less than three weeks maternity leave after the baby is born.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A reputable survey carried out by the North-Thames regional health authority in 1990 showed that just over 20 per cent of all deliveries occurred between 41 and 44 weeks gestation. The figures also showed that 47 per cent of deliveries occurred before the 40th week, 32 per cent occurred at 40 weeks, 16 percent at 41 weeks, 3.8 percent at 42 weeks and 0.2 per cent at 43 weeks. If that were translated on to a national scale, under present arrangements, several hundred women would have to return to work because their maternity leave had expired before the baby was born. No one would believe that that is a sound way to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will reduce a woman's choice as to when to start her maternity leave if she is ill in late pregnancy. If she falls sick even for one day after the 28th week of pregnancy, she will be forced to start her maternity leave if the sickness is pregnancy related. Under the existing scheme, a woman can receive sick pay until the sixth week before the childbirth if she falls sick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under present arrangements, if she is sick for a short period, she can return to work before she starts maternity leave. Our interpretation is that that would not be the case under the proposed procedure. Only 14 weeks leave are offered by the new scheme, so one can envisage that a woman who is forced to start her maternity leave from 11 weeks before the birth may have a shorter period of maternity leave after the birth than she would have sensibly planned and for which her medical advisers might have called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision will apply to those women who currently qualify for up to 14 weeks leave before birth and the right to return 29 weeks after the birth. We are concerned that that contradicts the basis of the European Community directive, which makes it clear that there should be no regression from existing rights. As presently drafted, the proposal is a step down from existing rights even though it is supposed to be an improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>353</span>
Extending maternity leave by four weeks—from 14 to 18 weeks—will affect about 40 per cent of working pregnant women—160,000 a year. The remaining 60 per cent will qualify for 11 weeks maternity leave before the birth and 29 weeks after the birth. The figure of 18 weeks maternity leave fits in with women's current use of maternity rights, if that is how they can be described. At present, British women take, on average, 20 weeks maternity leave for their first child and 18 weeks for subsequent births. The Bill will bring the law into line with practice. We are in favour of the law being aligned to practice although those who make money out of it not being aligned may be unhappy with that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The primary purpose of maternity leave is to protect and promote the well-being of the mother and her baby. We question whether 14 weeks leave is long enough to do that. Recendy, a Department of Heahh study on the health of women following childbirth showed that just fewer man half of mothers reported at least one unpleasant symptom within three months of the delivery of their child. The symptom continued for six weeks and they had not experienced it before. It was a birth-related unpleasant symptom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A mother in those circumstances may return to work because feeling rotten does not justify her being on sick leave. Work will be unpleasant for her and probably unsatisfactory from the employer's point of view because most of us do not perform at our best when we are feeling rotten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the birth is not straightforward, 18 weeks will be better for the health of the modier and the baby than 14 weeks. One of the trends in births is the increase in the number of multiple births. In 1990, 30 births in every 1,000 produced at least triplets compared with 10 per 1,000 20 years ago. Babies born in multiple births frequendy have low birth weights and need special care. Their mothers may suffer high levels of fatigue and are more likely to have undergone caesarian deliveries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pre-term births often necessitate a period of hospital care for the baby, and in some cases for the mother too. Many women rightly feel unable and unwilling to return to work while leaving a sick baby at home or to collect me baby from hospital and return to work almost immediately. In recent years more than 10 per cent of babies have been delivered by caesarian section for which the period of recuperation is longer than for the more common and traditional method of birth. Those categories of women would benefit from the four-week extension from 14 to 18 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Government's new timetable, immunisation against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus has to be completed within four months of birth. In its publication "Birth to Five", the Heafth Education Authority—a Government body—welcomes the fact that under the present scheme immunisations can be completed while the baby is visiting the clinic or doctor regularly and before the mother goes back to work. It recommends that approach, but under the new scheme, most women will not be able to do that. The Heahh Education Authority is formally charged with improving the nation's heahh. It is odd that the Government are proposing measures that fly in the face of the recommendations of that authority.

Child care is difficult to find for young babies. There are various forms of child care—childminders or more formal care—but carers prefer to care for older children rather dian younger children and babies. It is increasingly difficult for mothers to return to work and place then-babies in secure care during the day. Figures show that 36 per cent of mothers returning to full-time work rely heavily on childminders for care. Many childminders are reluctant to care for babies under the age of six. The National Childminding Association has said that as small babies require particularly intensive care—that is common senste—the number of minders willing to look after them is reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Caring for a baby can make it impossible for a childminder to look after another child because a small baby demands greater attention and has many needs. More than half of working mothers rely on relatives to care for their children, but it is difficult to persuade relatives to care for small babies, for understandable reasons. Also, there are inceasingly compelling health reasons for women to maintain breast-feeding. Recent research in the United Kingdom has shown that babies who were breast-fed for 13 weeks or more were three times—not 3 per cent—less likely than bottle-fed babies to contract gastro-intestinal fllnesses. Breast-feeding also protects against respiratory infections, childhood cancer, diabetes, malnutrition and cot death. The longer a woman can breast-feed her babies the better for those babies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Baroness Cumberlege, Under-Secretary of State for Health, speaking on behalf of the Government, so presumably she was outlining Government policy, has stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are quite clear and unequivocal that mother's milk is best for babies—particularly for the first few weeks of life. This is the message we must get across to all mothers."</p></blockquote>
It is plain daft for Baroness Cumberlege to tell the rather ageing clientele in the House of Lords that we must get across the message about baby care to all mothers—few of whom are to be found in the House of Lords—while the Department of Employment is introducing a measure which will make it more difficult to act on that message.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are also a signatory to the Innocenti declaration on breast-feeding, which states that all women should be enabled to practise exclusive breast-feeding and that all infants should be fed exclusively on breast milk until three to four months. There has been a decline in the number of breast-feeding mothers. That decline, which is contrary to common sense, medical advice and Government policy, could be exacerbated by the proposal. Mothers who wish to maintain breast-feeding will find it difficult to do so if they return to work three weeks after birth. Few workplaces provide the necessary futilities for breast-feeding at work, even if there is some form of child care there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several organisations also hold the view that there are advantages for employers, not just for women and babies, in the provision of 18 weeks leave, particularly as that coincides with the present statutory maternity pay arrangements. We are in difficulty because we still do not know what the Government wtil do about various entitlements to maternity pay, and to what those entitlements will be related. It is possible that the 18-week period for pay will be retained, but that there will be a 14-week period for maternity leave. That would pose administrative difficulties for employersThere would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0545">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>355</span>
two different periods. More than 50 per cent of employers recently reported that they were happy with the present statutory maternity pay arrangements, although they admitted that, initially, they had been discontented with the 18-week arrangements. As employers are already administering the 18-week statutory maternity pay scheme, it would seem sensible and practical to try to dovetail the new arrangements with the present ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested that the cost to employers and to the Government of extending maternity leave by four weeks would be offset by some savings. For instance, if employers are already providing 18 weeks maternity pay to women, they incur no extra costs by the extra four weeks that we are proposing. A high proportion of first-time mothers—88 per cent—and 56 per cent of those having second or subsequent children receive statutory maternity pay or maternity allowance for an 18-week period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another advantage for employers is that, as our proposal means that more women would stay on at work, there will be no additional recruitment and training costs for a maternity leave replacement, as the employer will have paid already to recruit such a replacement. That cost will not be added to the four-week period, as it will have been incurred at the beginning of the 14-week period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the employer will continue to pay the replacement a weekly wage for four weeks, that money would have had to be paid in any case to the woman returning from maternity leave after 14 weeks. That is not entirely a gain for the employer, but it shows that the proposal does not represent only a loss for the employer. As has been said, the employer would make an administrative saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be emphasised that employers can make substantial savings if women staff return to work. It is much cheaper to continue to employ the same staff than it is to get rid of them or lose them and to recruit new workers. The recruitment process is very expensive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Women will be more likely to return to work, and they will be better placed to do so, if they have had 18 weeks rather than 14 weeks maternity leave. The cost of losing an employee is very high. When an employee leaves an organisation, the money spent on training is lost—although for many British companies that amount is minimal. Also, that employee's job-related skills are lost, as is the good will associated with an effective employee's relationships with people both in a firm and outside it. In the public service, the cost of training a nurse is £13,000. That is a lot of money to lose. Common sense suggests that our proposal would increase the retention of nurses in the national health service. It is estimated that the average cost of recruitment is about £2,000. The Midland bank has estimated that it could save between £8,000 and £10,000—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.20 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat the point that I was making before our proceedings were interrupted by the Division in the House. I was saying that the Midland bank recently estimated that it would save £8,000 to £10,000 a head on replacing employees who, without child care, would have left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several other savings would be made by increasing maternity leave from 14 to 18 weeks. There would be savings because a woman's return to work would be easier and smoother after 18 weeks leave. The staying-on at work rate would increase and there would be no need for protracted sick leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be savings to the Exchequer in terms of national insurance contributions, tax and social security benefits. For example, nearly all lone parents who are not working receive income support and about one third of women who worked during pregnancy, but were not working nine or 10 months after giving birth, receive some form of unemployment benefit. A substantial proportion of women who do not return to work receive benefits which they would not receive if they were back at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Probably the biggest impact of the extension would be on the poorest and lowest paid women. A statutory entitlement to 18 weeks' maternity leave would be valuable because while a number of women in reasonably well-paid jobs already have favourable arrangements, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0546">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>357</span>
would help women who are presently at a disadvantage but who need it most—the low paid—because, up to now, they have fallen outside the statutory maternity leave qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that those are sound arguments for extending coverage to 18 weeks. The move is supported by most of the organisations that campaign, year in and year out, to improve maternity rights and, therefore, the health of women and their children. Such women's performance at work would also improve when they. returned because a woman worn out and run down by childbirth and forced back to work before she is fit to be there will make less of a contribution than she would have done had she had more time to recover. There are good reasons for the extension to 18 weeks and we hope that the Government will be sympathetic to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Nicholls 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not view clause 20 as a welcome step. It will create bad legislation, but I accept that its passage is right and inevitable. The Government are introducing it because they are required to do so by European legislation. There is nothing inconsistent in the Government confirming that they will honour to the hilt their European obligations, yet saying that, ideally, they would not be taking such a step unless forced to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Minister were to reply that times and fashions have changed so much that this is a desirable, free-standing measure quite apart from our European obligations, I should, in the spirit of helpfulness, refer him to statements from the Dispatch Box when I was Under-Secretary of State—before the European initiative—in which we said the opposite. However, if that were considered to be an unsporting line to take, I should not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the passage of the clause is inevitable and that, to comply with our European obligations, it is right to introduce it. However, I think that it is bad and undesirable for two reasons. First, and most importantly, it is bad for women's employment prospects and, secondly, it is bad for employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is bad for women because at a time of high unemployment and when there is no sign that unemployment levels will come down in the forseeable future, anyone who may be thought to be offering a disadvantage to an employer in the labour market will be less favourably considered than another applicant. It is unsporting of me to say this, but as an employer I have knowledge of what I am talking about, which may distinguish my contribution from some other contributions that we have heard today. As an employer looking for a recruit, I must consider the obligations that the employee will bring and also those that will be imposed on me by the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the really bad old days, when the period before which an employee qualified for unfair dismissal was as short as six months, and with the burden of proof on the employer, I recall many cases in which I dismissed employees who were not coming up to the mark after five months because I could not take the risk of employing them for seven months. That was unfortunate, but reflected the state of the law at the time. In one case, I realised subsequently that I lost an extremely good employee because I ws not prepared to take a risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Like it or not, employers will look at somebody who is entitled, by statute, to take time off that was not planned to run in accordance with the business and at a time of great unemployment, they will say to themselves, "Do I really need to take that step?" Speaking from experience, I know that employers will say, "We do not need to take that risk." Women will be positively disadvantaged by the amendment.

Two points arise from that: first, that decision should be left to the employer who must weigh up the pros and cons of taking on somebody else: secondly, employers in small businesses who may employ five, four, three or even one employee may not have the time to wait for 14, 18 or 40 weeks to re-employ that person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Women have a different experience of life. In some ways, they are recognised to have skills that are not always taken account of in the labour market, but which are just as valid. Perhaps, as a potential employer, the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason why it would be relevant to consider whether an employee might be pregnant, in reference to 14 or 18 weeks, is the effect that it would have on the business if that person had to take leave of absence. When the hon. Lady says that people can become ill without intending to, that is the point—they can become
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>360</span>
ill without intending too. Except in limited circumstances, the employee can choose whether to become pregnant. However, the employer has no choice about whether to employ someone who has that capacity. There is a practical way forward, for which existing legislation provides.

I and other members of the Committee have received representations from a sect called the Strict Brethren. It is a tiny religious sect of 3,500 members. Its representatives have sufficient interest in the Bill to sit through our proceedings. They are worried about the amendment that we are debating. They acknowledge that it is unlikely that their arguments will be accepted by the Committee. However, I believe that the Committee would like to know their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most members of the Strict Brethren earn their living by working in small businesses. They employ 1,300 people. Their employees are not taken into a massive, international, soulless firm. The organisation that they join is almost an extension of their family. In the past, the brethren have retained the right to tell male and female employees that they expect specific standards of behaviour. If those standards are breached, members of the brethren do not understand why they should continue to employ the person responsible. A tiny minority of people believe that if they take someone into their family who then insists on having children out of wedlock, they are entitled to dispense with her services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Clause 20 does not repeal section 12 of the Employment Act 1980. That provision states that it is open to small businesses of five or fewer employees to clam that it would not be financially viable for them to have an employee returning to work after maternity leave. They have to prove that point, but, at least, they have the opportunity to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider this point, but as I understand it section 12 of the Employment Act 1980 remains in force. It may be that the distinction turns on whether it should be 40 weeks or 14 weeks or that, because of European principles, we are not allowed to repeal rights, but only enhance them. I do not know. Whether one considers the issue from the point of view of a tiny band of people or from that of what enhances women's employment and what enables employers to offer employment opportunities, the existing law recognises that small businesses may not be able to accept people back after maternity leave. If the law recognises that and section 12 of the 1980 Act has not been repealed, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to say that an exemption exists which is not immediately apparent in the Bill. If not, at the very least, although rejecting my view he can acknowledge that there is some merit in the Government's position so far and that because of European obligations we must not take a course of action that we might otherwise have adopted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First and foremost, I shall consider the points raised by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras before I turn my attention to those of my hon. friend the Member for Teignbridge. I cannot accept the amendment to increase from 14 weeks to 18 weeks the statutory period of maternity leave to which all women are entitled irrespective of length of service or the hours they work. That would increase employers' costs considerably and place an unacceptable additional burden on them. That would damage women's employment prospects. The figure of 14 weeks leave has been accepted by all European Community member states under the terms of the pregnant workers directive as a reasonable minimum statutory leave entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras spoke of the possibility of a woman returning to work before her child was born because of when the period of leave started. I have made this point earlier, but there is no question of any woman being required to return to work before she has had her baby. The Bill is designed to ensure that in the unlikely circumstances that were described, leave will be extended until the birth, after which the woman will have two weeks compulsory leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras referred to women who have the unfortunate experience of giving birth by caesarian operation and spoke of their level of fitness. That is different and other circumstances would apply to such ladies. I accept that the physical state of a woman who has given birth by caesarian section would mean that she is less available for work and that she would have difficulty getting round. Her problems are more difficult because of the incision in her stomach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Women who meet the qualifying criteria of two years service for those who work at least 16 hours a week or five years service for those who work between eight and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>362</span>
16 hours a week will be entitled, as at present, to longer maternity absence in addition to 14 weeks maternity leave, which may begin up to 11 weeks before the expected childbirth. They can take a further absence of up to 29 weeks from the beginning of the week of childbirth, giving them a total of 40 weeks absence or longer if the baby is late. That conforms with the provisions of the 1978 Act. That is what the directive requires and I have already described in detail how that can be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the deep anxiety of my hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge, which he expressed on behalf of the Strict Brethren. I cannot offer him any words of comfort on the 14 weeks statutory period because it is a new right, irrespective of length of service. My hon. Friend pointed out the changes available as a result of the 1980 Act when companies employ under five people. It is true that they would not necessarily be liable for the extended maternity provision. That still applies to those companies that employ fewer than five people. There can be no exemptions from the 14 weeks maternity leave which will be part of legislation for the first time when the Bill is enacted. It will apply to everyone. I hope that that will give some small comfort to my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friends, that the clause as drafted could mean that a woman must return to work before the birth of her baby because she has run out of time. The Minister said that that could not happen, but I do not understand how. He said that many women have up to 40 weeks, but that has nothing to do with the Bill. A large minority of women do not qualify for existing maternity provisions. Will the Minister please explain again how a woman will avoid running out of time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear earlier that the maternity period could not start until 11 weeks before the estimated date of delivery. A three-week period would still be available between 11 and 14 weeks. A woman would still be entitled to two weeks compulsory leave after the birth of the child. I cannot envisage any circumstances in which what the hon. Gentleman fears might happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Where is the reference to the two weeks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The two weeks compulsory leave will probably be introduced under health and safety regulations. They must be implemented because of the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is part of the directive; it will be implemented by the Health and Safety Executive, not by regulation. We do not tell the Health and Safety Executive what to do. It will need to consider the matter and we shall make representations to the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several hon. Members want me to give way. I shall sit down and let them make their points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the Minister is saying that irrespective of how much maternity leave a woman has had, she will, in any event, be entitled to two weeks leave after the birth or after 14 weeks of maternity leave. Let us suppose that the birth was two weeks late, which would not be unusual. Would she get two weeks leave plus two weeks or just the two weeks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I missed the hon. Gentleman's point and I do not want to misinterpret his question. Will he repeat the last sentence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not clear. The Minister said that under the proposed health and safety legislation, a woman will be entitled to two weeks leave after the birth of her child. Does that mean two weeks after the birth if it comes at 44 weeks—four weeks after the expected delivery date? If the birth were at 43 weeks, would she get one week plus one week or would she get two weeks plus one making it three weeks, or would she be guaranteed two weeks, irrespective of when the birth took place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to page 38 of the Bill which refers to new section 35(2) for the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsection (3), where any requirement imposed by or under any provision of any enactment or of any instrument made under any enactment, other than a provision for the time being specified in an order made under section 45(3), prohibits her from being employed for any period after the end of that period of fourteen weeks by reason of her having recently given birth, her maternity leave period shall continue until the expiry of that later period."</p></blockquote>
That answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it does not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not understand it, but it answers the point. For the woman to begin her maternity leave 11 weeks before the predicted date of birth and for the birth to be overdue by more than three weeks is unusual, but I bow to the greater knowledge of the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. However, she would still have a further two weeks leave even if the birth was at the end of the 14th week instead of at the end of the 11th week as predicted by the doctor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister is adding confusion to confusion. A few minutes ago he said that the extra two weeks would be dealt with in the health and safety regulations, but now he is referring to a provision in the Bill. He also implied earlier that a caesarian section was a different situation. Will he please clarify the different extensions that will be possible and whether they are covered by this Bill or by health and safety regulations? If they will be covered by the health and safety regulations to be introduced in the future, will they come into effect at the same time as the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I have confused hon. Members. That was not my intention, especially at this
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>364</span>
late hour. The Bill allows those provisions to be introduced by the Health and Safety Executive. We believe that that is the right and proper way to proceed. That is our clear intention but if there are difficulties, I will reconsider the matter in the light of the representations that have been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we dwell on this matter a little longer. The Minister clarified the Government's intention, but some of us are still a little confused about how they intend to put it into effect and about the timing. Is it the intention to bring forward the regulations to coincide with the implementation of the Bill? If not, although the Government may intend to allow two weeks leave whenever the birth takes place, some women may be caught in the intervening period—as we have warned—and may have to return to work before they have had their child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government have already thought through this possibility why have they not clarified the matter in the Bill? Are they thinking of clarifying it later, before the Bill is enacted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a prohibition on employment, as opposed to an employment right, during the period concerned. We shall be implementing the directive's requirements for two weeks compulsory leave around the time the legislation is in place. The new section 35(2) should ensure that the maternity leave period does not run out before birth. That was, I believe, the point that most concerned the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. We are considering the best way in which to clarify that. I am advised that it would be done most appropriately through the health and safety regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that the confusion illustrates the gross complexity of the maternity provisions—now almost three-tier provisions—with which we are dealing? Legislation and EC directives are coming at us from all angles. If Committee members are confused and need to have matters clarified, how on earth will those using the system—either employers or pregnant women attempting to find out their rights—make their way through it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been discussing the extra two weeks to be allowed to those women whose babies stubbornly refuse to be born on time. Why does not the Minister admit that a change to 18 weeks would be a simplifying measure? He has already spoken of adopting a 16-week period in many instances. Why on earth not simplify the whole thing and move directly to 18 weeks? We would all be much happier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if the hon. Lady finds the matter confusing. We are not already moving to a 16-week period. Worry has been expressed about certain instances in which the time might run out. I have tried to explain why that is most unlikely. In the very unlikely circumstances that somebody begins her leave on day one of the 11th week and then overruns the expected time of birth by three weeks, she would still be able to spend another two weeks after the birth away from work, as set out in the directive. I do not see that that is confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have told the Committee that I intend to draw the various rights together in one leaflet covering the different elements so that people can understand them better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I understood part of the Minister's clarification, but I have now ceased to understand. It relates to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. The Minister has just said that if a woman overruns the period by three weeks, she will have the facility for a further two weeks leave after the birth. That arrangement is based on the assumption that she exhausts her entire entitlement. What would be envisaged as happening under the forthcoming health and safety regulations if a woman started her maternity leave at the earliest date, the 11th week, and overran, let us say, by two weeks? There would be a week spare. Are the Government saying that there must still be two weeks left to her after that, or that, because the birth was within the three weeks, there would be no extra provision? It is still not clear to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mclaughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the birth was at 12 weeks as opposed to 14—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not think that the hon. Member for Northfield put his point particularly well, and I want to ensure that I get the figures right. If the birth was at 12 weeks, the compulsory two-week period in which the woman should not work because of having given birth would take her up to the 14th week. But if she gave birth in the 13th week, there would be a week extra because the two-week compulsory non-working period at the time of birth would apply and would overrun the period. That would happen in very few cases, but I hope that the provision goes some way to allaying the fear of running out of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am exceptionally surprised that the Government have not responded to so many of our good and sensible amendments. It sticks out a mile that maternity leave of 18 weeks must be good for womenfolk who have just gone through a pregnancy. The additional four weeks would make them fitter and more able and they would be physically attuned to going back to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fortunate as I have two sons. They were both premature, and there must be many cases of premature birth throughout the country. Not many premature births are completely free of difficulties—the mothers often suffer physical ailments as a result. They need a bit of time to get body and soul back together after the trauma of having a child. In addition, a child is a very costly item. I know that to my peril—I lived in poverty for years. It is only since becoming a Member of Parliament that my circumstances have improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will listen to us. The amendment would bring us in fine with a number of countries whose Governments show their womenfolk some compassion. The Minister should not always base his argument on what the Government are doing on minimum standards all over the world. If that were the case, we would still have slavery. I hope that any British Government would introduce provisions which could not always be compared with those of other countries, except to improve matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are lagging behind many of the countries that we have always prided ourselves on being in front of. That is now a bit of a myth. Environmentally, the United Kingdom is known as the dirty old man of Europe for many genuine reasons. If we refuse to consider the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>366</span>
compassionate extension of maternity leave for the womenfolk of Great Britain, we shall be known as the dirty, mean old men of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will know from experience that a four-week recuperation period is good for the health. Unfortunately, I happen to be an employer. I hope that I am compassionate and that I think of my female staff. I try my best to ensure that my staff do what is a very stressful job under the best circumstances. I give my secretary time off from the stress and strain of the job and ensure that she takes the appropriate holidays, plus a wee bit more. She started back after the holidays—I gave her a wee bit longer than normal—refreshed, raring to go and working like damn blazes for my constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe sincerely that there should be an 18-week maternity leave period. When looking at the state of us men here, I laugh like blazes! I wonder what we would do if we had a wain. We would want an extra six months off from work, not four weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am one of those fortunate Members of Parliament who has a very happy marriage. I still have that wee bit of flair, love and romance. I might not look the part—in my young days I was all right—but I have great love and admiration for my wife. I also have great love and admiration for other women. That is not a sexist remark; there are important dimensions to what I am saying. My mother is a wonderful creature. She is the woman who brought me into the world and who sacrificed much of her life to bring up me and two brothers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the womenfolk who work in hospitals, factories and offices and bring up families and who will continue, hopefully, to bring up families. Married women have the right to get pregnant and to bring up a family. Under the Bill, women will be allowed the statutory period of 14 weeks' maternity leave. Our amendment would allow those womenfolk, whom we all love, 18 weeks' leave. We would not be here if it had not been for our mothers. I ask all members of the Committee to remember their mothers, who would have loved to have had an additional four weeks off from their work to recuperate, become healthy and ensure that productivity in this country goes up and that we are served well in our offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of young women who have left work, had children and who, unfortunately, became ill. By that I do not mean physical illness. As the Minister will know, after childbirth, some women suffer mental traumas. Such problems are not easy to solve. It is not a matter of a woman cutting her wrist, having a few stitches, a bandage being wrapped round and her waiting for the wound to heal. Many medical illnesses that result from childbirth cannot be healed overnight. One of the best remedies in the world is "time healing". Surely, Britain should lead the world in the care of our womenfolk and we should not go back into the dark ages and apply minimum standards. Let us raise the standards for our womenfolk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having followed the hon. Gentleman's speech, it is only appropriate to acknowledge the importance—if indirect—of the contribution to the debate of Mrs. Graham senior.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes to increase the period of 14 weeks to one of 18 weeks. Indeed, amendment No. 105 proposes an unlimited increase. I have difficulty in deciding what the issues are in relation to clause 20, even
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0551">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>367</span>
more so to clause 26. There is considerable confusion about what we are obliged to do as a consequence of commitments made to the European Community and what we do in relation to our domestic affaire—making our own judgments, and achieving a balance between the rights of women and the economic necessities of providing greater employment for women. I make no bones about it: I am extremely concerned at how parts of the Bill follow the creeping competence of the European Community in extending jurisdiction into employment matters by using the lever of health and safety. In dealing with the amendments to clause 20, the focus of our argument should be the commitments that we have made to the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the points made by Opposition Members, particularly by the hon. Member for Gateshead, East, featured the creeping competence of the community. One suspects that the Labour party is trying to use this debate as a lever to promote their failed socialist policies in Britain, allowing the socialist Commissioner, who has now fortunately left the Commission, to cause considerable havoc in employment patterns. Will my hon. Friend the Minister tell us what we have agreed to commit ourselves to under the Bill? I understand that we have not accepted in principle that the Community is entitled in its directive to take competence in health and safety matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except for the two weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is correct, and we have abstained from voting in the council as a consequence of that objection in principle, we have left ourselves the opportunity to challenge that in the European Court. Before we deal with those details, we need to know whether it is the Government's intention to make such an application. I and many of my hon. Friends are profoundly concerned about that creeping competence, particularly in the pattern of employment legislation. I and most Conservative Members would regard that as pre-eminently a matter of subsidiarity—a matter that is best determined in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that the hon. Gentleman says that his party shares his fears about creeping competence and that such matters should be covered by subsidiarity, will he explain how the document issued after the Edinburgh summit at the conclusion of our presidency could confirm the Community's commitment to implement all the provisions of the charter of the fundamental social rights of workers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not much of a secret that the most important element in the development of Community is the single market. Several changes may flow from that, but much of what has been brought forward as a result of Maastricht is considered premature by many people. It is no secret that we sought exemptions from some of the policies that our partners were prepared to take on, to avoid damaging our economy. The social chapter is one of those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Sykes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that we have implemented all the recent EC social employment directive? The Greek Commissioner who tried to implement the 48-hour week represents a country that shares joint bottom place with Eire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>368</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is significant that that Commissioner has left the Commission and has not been re-appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Knox. As a new Member of the House, I seek your guidance. I had understood that the Government presented the Bill as a consequence of their acceptance of a European directive. The speech that we have just heard, and that of the hon. Member for Teignbridge, (Mr. Nicholls) had no bearing on that principle. The Committee has important matters to deal with. It is immaterial to me whether they are dealt with at 3 o'clock in the morning, because, like fellow members of the Committee, I shall stay in London. I seek your guidance, Mr. Knox, on whether those speeches have strayed too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first part of the hon. Gentleman's question is not a matter for me. However, the debate has certainly strayed much too far. Committee members on both sides have been guilty and we should, in the remaining time, confine ourselves to the choice between 14 and 18 weeks. The European single market has nothing to do with the matter, nor have most of the other matters that have been mentioned, with the exception of those raised by the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras and—with one or two small exceptions—by the hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My points are germane to the amendment, and indeed to the next amendment, which extends—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not debating the next amendment. I propose to keep the debate strictly to the question of 14 or 18 weeks. Unless members of the committee refer to that they will be ruled out of order straight away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am seeking, Mr. Knox, precisely to refer to the question of 14 or 18 weeks and to ask the Minister to clarify his position on that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, what effect would it have if the Government chose to challenge the directive on which the amendment and the clause are based? Secondly, what commitment—if any—have we made to the European Community concerning the number of weeks that we shall insert in the clause? I make no apologies for saying—I suspect that many Committee members would agree—that the matter should be determined on its merits in the British situation and in the interests of the British economy, not imposed on us from outside.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our arguments for the amendment are twofold. First, there is a case in logic and commonsense for bringing the period of maternity leave into fine with statutory maternity pay regulations and providing for a period of 18 weeks for both. That is sensible and most people would regard it as reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, and more compellingly, the extension of the period to 18 weeks would provide a much more adequate period of maternity leave for women in several key categories, particularly those who might otherwise be at risk of mental as well as physical injury if they were compelled, or felt under pressure, to return to work too early after the birth of their child.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>369</span>
The Minister referred earlier to an extra two-week period that he said would be introduced by various health and safety regulations. That is an interesting admission, because at the beginning of this discussion—it feels rather a long time ago—I understood the Government's case to be that they did not accept that there was a health and safety connection between pregnancy and maternity leave. They appear now to be saying that they are preparing health and safety regulations for another two weeks' maternity leave. We are now, therefore, disputing a two-week not a four-weeks period, since the Government have conceded the case for a 16-week period of maternity leave if there is a threat to the woman's health. So we are not discussing a substantive point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I try to help the hon. Gentleman? As I told the hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras, we will be implementing the directive's requirement for two weeks' compulsory leave around the time of the birth. New section 35(2) in the 1978 Act should ensure that the maternity leave period does not run out. We are not talking about extending the term of leave up to 16 weeks and if the hon. Gentleman had followed the earlier debate that would have been clear to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did follow the earlier debate, but I am sure that most of my hon. Friends will be even more confused by that so-called clarification by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bottom line for many Opposition Members is that if we consider a typical case of a pregnant employee who starts her maternity leave 11 weeks before the expected birth of her child—a very common pattern—she will be left with a period of only three weeks thereafter under the Bill. Many organisations, from the Maternity Alliance to the Equal Opportunities Commission, have stressed that that remaining period of three weeks, within which a woman will be compelled to return, is patently inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are several specific examples where that issue is highlighted. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras referred to some of them but I shall concentrate on three. The number of multiple births is increasing in Britain and those children are often of low birth weight and in need of special care. A number of other health hazards may face these women and especially their children. I wonder how many of us as parents would feel happy about our partners, who had given birth in those circumstances, feeling under pressure to return to work within three weeks—I suspect very few.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also draw attention to the immunisation programme against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus which must be completed four months after birth. That process is made easier if the mother and child regularly attend a clinic. Under the new scheme proposed by the Government it is likely—I do not claim that it will be certain—that some women will be unable to complete the programme, which would be a reprehensible development
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third health and safety aspect of the issue is breast feeding, a matter to which my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras drew attention. The Government are signatories to the Innocenti declaration on breast feeding, which makes it clear that they support the case for exclusive reliance on breast feeding for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>370</span>
children up to between four and six months of age. I am sure that all members of the Committee agree that it will be difficult to comply with that admirable declaration in the circumstances envisaged by the clause. If a woman returns to work as soon as three weeks after the birth of a child, the prospect of complying with it will be small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our case is based on logic and sound considerations of health and welfare for both mother and children, but two further points arise from the contributions of Conservative Members. The argument that our amendment is somehow tied up with the social chapter is spurious. The social chapter could not be described, as the hon. Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste) attempted to describe it as some sort of socialist tract. It is worth pointing out that that document is supported by all other member states of the Community, Conservative and socialist alike, and it is straining credibility to describe it as a socialist creed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant to Opposition Members that Conservative members of the Committee support the clause only under pressure from the Whips and with the greatest reluctance. The Minister has trumpeted the clause as a new social conversion undertaken by the Conservative party in support of the rights of pregnant women at work, but it is clear that most ofhis hon. Friends do not support him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to stick to your ruling, Mr. Knox, and keep strictly to the amendment, despite the provocation that we suffered earlier from the hon. Member for Teignbridge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not spoken on part II of the Bill. I do not have much expertise to bring to the matter. I have never represented women workers and I do not have the experience of some of my hon. Friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can wrap up the issue in whatever language one likes, but it remains fundamental and it is far from being a socialist issue. If one tries to justify it as Conservative Members tried to do, one can adequately represent it as a question of choice without stretching the facts. Fourteen weeks of maternity leave, starting at 11 weeks and ending possibly at only three weeks after what could have been difficult birth, is not an acceptable minimum standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fact of life that people in this modern age do not have the chance to change their employment when starting a family and cannot choose when to re-enter the employment market or take up their career again. It is a fact of modern life because the structure of the economy and employment has changed. Many people are absolutely dependent on the salary of a woman, whether they are single-parent families or couples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Teignbridge talked about people with employment experience as if they were the only people who were entitled to have an opinion on employment legislation. Some of us bring other experience to the House, but we do not try to force it on people. Some of us have experience of neighbourhoods of profound poverty and difficulty. People in work can suffer that sort of poverty as much as those out of work. There may be a dearth of such experience among Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A young family may find themselves in circumstances where the woman is obliged to give up work 11 weeks before the expected date—that is more likely under the

new legislation—and then required to return to work after three weeks. That is absolutely unacceptable and it does not allow women the choice of whether they choose to continue their employment. There is no doubt that some people are forced to break off their employment because 14 weeks is not long enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pregnancy is a stressful and difficult time. Much work has been done recently on the need for a time after childbirth for bonding between mother and child. The Government expect and will oblige women—not those in good financial circumstances, because they do not need such legislation, but ordinary working women, married or otherwise—to return to work three, if not fewer, weeks after the birth of the child. There is a two-week post-natal requirement in the health and safety regulations. That is not an adequate period. It is totally separate. There will be three weeks in somes cases and two weeks in others. If the Minister accepted the amendment there would be reasonable time and choice would be given to pjeople who do not have—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Eighteen weeks would provide an adequate period, so that they could, if necessary, break off their employment 11 weeks before the expected date of confinement The legislation would then provide substantial leeway after the birth, even if the birth was a little later than expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to protract the proceedings. The Minister has concentrated on the potentially absurd situation in which the Bill could put women. He says that that will be dealt with, adequately or inadequately and in due course, by Mr. Rimington of the Health and Safety Executive—if he gets round to making his two-week order. As my hon. Friends have pointed out, it is difficult to reconcile the Government's statement that the matter has nothing to do with safety—if they fight the case through the various European institutions—with their saying that part of the provision will depend on a rule laid down by the Health and Safety Executive. I would not like to be the Government's advocate in court, coping with that minor point That is just one inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>372</span>
I hope that none of my hon. Friends will take offence, but as my hon. Friends the Members for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde and for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) said, we are not here just to talk about the potential absurdities of the situation, but to say that there are clear and simple merits, from the point of view of the woman and her employer, in having 18 weeks instead of 14 weeks. The advantages to the woman are as plain as a pikestaff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sixteen weeks is a sensible period of time and it is supported by most organisations that have devoted their existence to promoting the maternity rights of women and the health and safety of women and their babies. It is also wholly in line with other Departments of Government which are advocating policies that are irreconcilable with the 14-week limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East said that the proposal would deprive many women of choice. I quarrel with that. Some women, if they stayed off work, would be entitled to 18 weeks off work. These women will have the invidious choice of returning to work at the end of their statutory period and forgoing an entitlement to four weeks' statutory maternity pay. Some badly paid women will be presented with that absurd choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all concerned about growing levels of violence and uncivil behaviour among children, especially those who come from certain poor communities. Much emphasis has been placed on the importance of bonding between a mother and her child and the contribution that it makes to a child growing up as a civilised human being For many women living in poverty and trying to work at the same time as bringing up a family, the possibilities of that bonding being developed beneficially are inhibited by the pressure to get back to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a whole host of good, sound, practical, health and psychological reasons why our proposed extension from 14 to 18 weeks should be supported. If the Government do not accept our amendment—not necessarily now—it will show that they are mean-minded. They will certainly not be in a position to trumpet the Bill as a triumph for the Government. The proposals would never have been drafted had it not been for the European directive. If the Government had had their way, they would have strangled it at birth. We shall stick by our proposition and fight for it all the way. It is a sound, generous, sensible, practical measure of help to women, their babies and society in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill will make an important change with regard to women's right to maternity leave. We are suggesting that it be 14 weeks. Much play has been made of the idea that that proposal would allow the mother only three weeks after the birth of the baby. That is not true. As I said this morning, it will be up to the mother when the period during the run-up to the birth will start. The nonsense that has been expressed time and again is exactly that—nonsense. The mother will have the option not to start the period of leave at 11 weeks. If she is ill as a consequence of her pregnancy 11 weeks before the birth, the period will begin. Otherwise it will not start until such time when she wishes it to start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In exceptional circumstances when the period may run out the two-week period of compulsory non-working will apply. We shall discuss later the appropriate regulations
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>373</span>
governing that procedure. There is no inconsistency in the Government using the Health and Safety Executive in this matter. Some parts of the directive clearly have health and safety implications, and we would not have argued had the directive been confined to those specific aspects. That the directive was widened was why we argued with its legal basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste), we are pursuing the proposal partly because of the directive. Moreover, it was included in the manifesto that we presented to the country when we were so successfully returned in April. For all the shouting by the Opposition, when faced with the choice, the British people decided to trust the Conservative party's manifesto rather than that of the Labour party. We clearly stated in our manifesto our categoric commitment to 14 weeks maternity leave and protection against dismissal on grounds of pregnancy. We are implementing the directive and we should reject the Opposition's amendment to extend the period to 18 weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 105, in page 38, line 2, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) An employee may extend her maternity leave if, before the expiry of her maternity leave, she gives her employer a certificate from a registered medical practitioner stating that by reason of disease or bodily or mental disablement or by reason of the health of the baby she will be incapable of work at the end of her period of maternity leave. In such a case, her maternity leave period shall continue until the expiry of the period for which she is certified by a registered medical practitioner as being incapable of work.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 113, in clause 21, page 39, line 26, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) after her maternity leave has ended she is dismissed and the reason for her dismissal (or, if there is more than one, the principal reason for her dismissal) is that she has given birth to a child or any other reason connected with her having given birth to a child where, before the expiry of her maternity leave, she has given her employer a certificate from a registered medical practitioner stating that by reason of disease or bodily or mental disablement she will be incapable of work at the end of her period of maternity leave,".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It makes sense for the two amendments to be discussed together because they have a common theme. Amendment No. 113, which we particularly support,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>374</span>
refers to clause 21 and the Committee might feel that it has made instant progress. Amendment No. 105 is a probing amendment to clarify some of the Government's intentions. We believe that amendment No. 113 is more substantive and we shall wish to vote on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised by the remarks made by the hon. Member for Elmet who thought that amendment No. 105 would grant unlimited maternity leave. I cannot understand that attitude. It could not have arisen from a detailed reading of the amendment which makes it clear that the conditions under which an employee may extend maternity leave would be connected with disease or bodily or mental disablement which would render the woman incapable of work at the end of her maternity leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is more appropriate than it would have been had the Government accepted our proposals to extend the period from 14 to 18 weeks. When we deal with clause 21, we shall be keen to maintain amendment No. 113 if there have been no concessions from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister does not seem to be listening I hope that he will respond to my next point. He still does not seem to be listening carefully to me. The reason we include in amendment No. 105 the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"by reason of the health of the baby"</p></blockquote>
is because, particularly if a baby has been born late, the baby will need care beyond the period of maternity leave originally envisaged. Another good reason for an employee to extend her maternity leave in accordance with our proposals would be if the baby's health was delicate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that the effect of the clause is unclear and that it would only provide protection for a woman whose work is such that she cannot lawfully return to work after 14 weeks. The clause does not protect a woman who is physically or mentally unfit to return to work at the end of her maternity leave. That important point must be dealt with at some stage in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arguably, if a woman is not fit to report for work, an employer who requires her to return would breach the general duty under section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974
	<br><blockquote><p>"to ensure, as far as it is reasonably practical, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees."</p></blockquote>
However, that is a general requirement and we believe that something more specific is warranted so that a woman in bad physical or mental condition or whose baby is ill, should be able to extend her maternity leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A woman with two years' service is entitled under current law to extend her maternity leave by four weeks for medical reasons. The amendment is similarly worded to provisions which apply to women with more than two years' full-time service. Some kind of provision should apply to all women whether or not they meet the current two-year limit. We hoped that the Government will take that aspect into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 113 relates to clause 21 and concerns women's rights as regards protection against dismissal. The amendment specifically refers to protection against dismissal when the mother is unfit to return to work. I hope that the Government are able to respond positively
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0555">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>375</span>
to that amendment. The amendment is clear, both in wording and intent. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"after her maternity leave has ended she is dismissed and the reason for her dismissal (or, if there is more than one, the principal reason for her dismissal) is that she has given birth to a child or any other reason connected with her having given birth to a child where, before the expiry of her maternity leave, she has given her employer a certificate from a registered medical practitioner stating that by reason of disease or bodily or mental disablement she will be incapable of work at the end of her period of maternity leave,'."</p></blockquote>
That is nothing like the open-ended commitment about which the hon. Member for Elmet seemed to be worried. It specifically relates to the production of a medical certificate stating that, for good reason, a woman is unable to return to work. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept the wording that we have proposed
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unclear whether clause 21 protects against such a dismissal. The clause seems to provide protection only for women whose work is such that they cannot lawfully return to work after 14 weeks. It does not seem to provide protection for women who are not physically or mentally fit to return to work at the end of their maternity leave, nor does it specifically mention the health of the baby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such women are likely to be entitled to statutory or contractual sick pay, but that right is contingent upon their continued employment. That is why they need protection against being dismissed if they are unable to work after 14 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned that, without the amendment, the majority of women will not have the two years service entitling them to complain of unfair dismissal. The existing statutory provisions provide a right to extend leave after 40 weeks by four weeks on health grounds. Obviously, Parliament accepted that that provision was necessary. The law provides for an extra four weeks in the case of women who have a full 40 weeks entitlement, but it is more appropriate that such a provision should apply to women who have only 14 weeks maternity leave. That is especially necessary because the Government have not been prepared to extend that right from 14 to 18 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would confer protection by introducing an additional ground on which to claim unfair dismissal, and it makes use of the wording that protects women who have worked for their current employer for two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once more, in support of the amendment, I should like to refer the Minister to the briefing that was supplied to members of the Committee by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. It is particularly interested in our amendment to clause 21 and it has provided substantial evidence to show that women are sometimes dismissed while on maternity leave. Although the Bill introduces a new right to protection from dismissal because of pregnancy, if a woman falls sick at the end of her maternity leave, it would be lawful for her employer to dismiss her. Amendment No. 113 would have the effect of protecting against dismissal women who are sick at the end of their maternity leave and it would give all women the rights that women with more than two years full-time service and five years part-time service currently enjoy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A CAB in south Wales reported the case of a client who was employed by a local newspaper for 16 years and who took maternity leave and gave the proposed date of her return to work after the birth. She was unable to keep to that date due to a car accident. She sent in a sick note and was assured by her line manager that everything would
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>376</span>
be all right She failed to return one month after the original date, at which point her sick note was still valid. She subsequently received notice of dismissal and she has since heard that her job no longer exists and was absorbed by other staff. She decided to take her case to a tribunal, but, as we know, that can be a long process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux also refers to similar situations in which male employees have been treated more favourably. For example, one employee successfully claimed unfair dismissal because of pregnancy by citing the comparable case of a man under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. On 23 October 1990, 	<i>The Guardian</i> reported that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a male colleague who had to have an eye operation was treated very graciously and was given as much time off as he needed."</p></blockquote>
Pregnancy should be treated no differently in circumstances in which a woman is physically or mentally unable to return to work after the maternity leave has expired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with the CAB that the Government should amend the Bill to ensure that women are protected from dismissal if they are sick at the end of their maternity leave. That right should not be restricted to those who have served the qualifying period with their employer, it should be available to all employees, as is the case with many other aspects of the maternity provisions which the Bill introduces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be interested to hear what the Government think about the amendments. We accept that there might be deficiencies in the wording, particularly of amendment No. 105, but we believe that amendment No. 113 should be seriously considered in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 105 would have little effect on the provisions of the Bill for a woman who could not return to work after her 14 weeks leave because she was sick. Under the Bill's provisions, she would be in the same situation as any other employee who was ill at the end of a period of leave and she and her employer would be bound by the terms of the contract relating to sickness. It is unlikely that a woman would be incapable of work because of her baby's health. In any case, I do not agree that the health of the baby should be a matter for employment legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the hon. Lady's comments on amendment No. 113. The Bill provides extensive protection against dismissal on maternity-related grounds. Opposition Members envisage cases in which an employer dismisses a woman purely because she is ill as a result of the birth of her baby and cannot return to work after maternity leave. Such dismissals must be a rare, but, in light of the hon. Lady's comments, I am willing to consider that issue and whether an amendment along the lines that she has outlined is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad of the Minister's comments concerning amendment No. 113. As I said at the beginning of our proceedings on maternity provisions, our amendments are designed as part of a comprehensive package to introduce a complete range of maternity provisions. In drafting amendment No. 105, we hoped that the Government would already have accepted the 18-week period of maternity leave rather than the 14-week period. Therefore, amendment No. 105 should be seen as complementary to the 18-week period rather than to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>377</span>
14-week period, which is the factor to which the Minister referred when he said that the amendment would make little difference. The amendment would have provided a helpful addition had the 18-week period been accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister has given some assurances on amendment No. 113, and I hope that, when we reach that part of clause 21, he will be able to give us more
