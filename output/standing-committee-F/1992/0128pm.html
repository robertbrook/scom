<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that, with this, we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 128, in page 43, line 41, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The Secretary of State shall not appoint a day under section 39 for this section to come into effect until three months have passed after the publication of a report on the terms and conditions of such workers by a committee

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: To recap—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no need to recap. If Members of the Committee did not understand what the hon. Lady was saying this morning, they never will.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That could be another back-handed compliment, Mr. Knox.<br><br>
I have spoken about the bad effects of deregulation on the labour market and considered some areas that are most vulnerable to exploitation. I was arguing that, although wages councils are far from perfect, they provide a floor, which prevents even worse exploitation from occurring. Because of imperfections in the operation of a totally deregulated labour market, some groups of workers are especially vulnerable. As such, we must oppose any other attempts further to deregulate, which Conservative Members refer to with a perverse use of language as "freeing up the labour market." We hope that other regulations will be introduced to protect especially vulnerable workers.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 610</span>
The purpose of deregulating the labour market can only be to lower wages further. The Government must want that to happen if they propose removing the few protections that are still available to people in that casual sector of the work force.<br><br>
A report in today's <i>Evening Standard</i> demonstrates some of the effects of deregulating the labour market. From a survey carried out by the factory inspectorate it has been shown that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Seven out of 10 firms in and around London are guilty of exploiting staff by either paying poverty wages or making employees work marathon hours … Breaches of employment laws have broken out across the country with South-East firms at the top of the league"</p></blockquote>
It reports breaches of the "hours" laws and states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Over 100,000 firms nationwide have been underpaying their staff over the last 12 years … only 82 were prosecuted"</p></blockquote>
That confirms two things: first, that deregulating the labour market encourages bad employers and, secondly, that if adequate safeguards—of which wages councils are but one—do not exist, deregulation ratchets down pay and conditions and increases exploitation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Lady referred to the article that appeared in the <i>Evening Standard.</i> It is based on figures that were produced a year ago and an interpretation of those figures by the Low Pay Unit. They are wholly misleading. The wages council inspectorate found that 99 per cent. of people in London covered by the wages councils are paid above or at the minimum level. I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw any suggestion that the article might be valid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not withdraw any suggestion that I have made about the exploitation of low-paid workers that has resulted from deregulation of the labour market. There are similar figures for my area in the north-west, which has one of the worst records for illegal underpayment of wages council workers and where the percentage of firms that underpay has increased. In 1991, 41.6 per cent. of all establishments visited by wages inspectors in the northwest were illegally underpaying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The article in the <i>Evening Standard</i> said that
<br><blockquote><p>"Seven out of 10 firms in and around London are guilty of exploiting staff".</p></blockquote>
The wages inspectorate found that that was not the case. It found that in seven out of 10 firms there was a problem with the records that were kept, which is quite distinct from the wages that are being paid to staff. It is very depressing that Opposition Members are prepared to accept propaganda from the Low Pay Unit but are not prepared to accept information from the wages inspectorate. The Committee is entitled to a more serious debate than the one that the hon. Lady is advancing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes the case for slowing down the proposed abolition of wages councils to enable members of the Committee to consider the statistics and discuss the matter. Alternatively, we could carry on bandying figures from one side to the other. The logic of what the Minister says is that he should put clause 28 on hold while we have a more objective look at what is going on.<br><br>
One of the oft repeated reasons for deregulation of the labour market, which will happen if the Conservatives abolish wages councils, is, to use their phrase, "to reduce
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0689">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 611</span>
the burdens on business." That seems to mean the reduction of wages and of the cost of hiring labour to such a low level that half the workers would take home wages that they could not live on. They would have to hope that the state would make up the difference. Reducing the burden on business would mean that the state and the taxpayer would subsidise bad employers who would treat workers arbitrarily. Those people would have to work long hours for little or no reasonable pay.<br><br>
Clause 28 would have other effects on employment. We have heard much about the possible effects of a statutory minimum wage—one of those areas of disputed statistics—or, indeed, of maintaining pay rates as high as £3.06 an hour. We are told by Conservative Members that the maintenance of such a high rate would destroy jobs. The Minister regularly argues that any job is better than no job, whatever the rate of pay. We even heard that a job with no pay is probably better than no job, which is a peculiar logic.<br><br>
There is another side to the coin that is not mentioned by Conservative Members. The attempt to reduce wages further is the only motivation for the Conservatives' attack on wages councils. If wages were to decrease, there would be a loss of spending power in the economy, which would affect jobs. I know that Conservative Members do not rate John Maynard Keynes or those who examine how the demand side of the economy is affected, but some of us believe that there is much truth in such an analysis of the economy.<br><br>
Before I was so rudely interrupted by the clock this morning, I was about to say that, in my area, it is estimated that about 330,000 people will suffer from the abolition of wages councils. There are no definite statistics on the number of people whose employment is covered by wages councils. If the Minister wants a good discussion about the reality of the effect of the changes, he should agree to collect such figures over several years to enable us to make a proper statistical analysis. That is another reason for delaying, for a few years at least, the arbitrary decision to abolish wages councils.<br><br>
In the north-west, about 330,000 people are likely to be adversely affected if wages councils are abolished because their wages will decrease. One in 10 households would be likely to lose spending power. A generous assumption is that the result of abolishing wages council will be to reduce wage rates by 20p, but the reduction is likely to be higher considering the rates that are being offered in jobcentres in the north-west. Assuming that the highest wages council rate falls from £3.06 by 20p and assuming that, given the number of people who work part-time in wages council industries, 18 hours are worked per week, the loss of spending power in Merseyside would be £10.2 million a year. The figure for the whole of the north-west would be £52 million a year—a significant reduction in spending power in the local and regional economy. Those reductions will in turn lead to significant job losses, particularly in service industries. Therefore, there is a further ratchet effect downward and a further increase in poverty.<br><br>
That is what has been happening since the neo-classical liberals gained power in the Conservative party and subjected us to their economic dogma, [hon. Members "Not Gilmour again."] Had we had the Gilmour faction, we should all have been far better off. He seems to be persona non grata for Conservative Members. There seems
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 612</span>
to be no respect for his views or for his strand of thinking, which is interesting. It proves that neo-classical liberals are alive and well and living on the Goverment Benches.<br><br>
If we were to take the Minister at his word and believe in the relationship between wage levels and employment, why on earth, as wages have plummeted, is there not higher employment? We have four million unemployed and wage-levels in the lower, more casual sector of the economy are plummeting. The Minister's figures do not add up any better than his theories.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span> rose—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister would get up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to oblige the hon. Lady. If she will not take my word on the relationship between pay and jobs and the undesirability of setting minimum wage levels through wages councils, perhaps she will take those of Mr. Gavin Laird, who said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It has never worked in the past, there is no logic for it; it does not work in any other country and it certainly will not work in Great Britain".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not wages councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that Mr. Laird's comments were about statutory minimum wages rather than wages councils. That is partly what we are arguing about. [<i>Interuption</i>]. That is because your Government—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is your Government, too, Mr. Knox.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Under no circumstances in the Committee is it my Government—nor, I add, is it my Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the most distressing features of the past few years is that such dogma has continued and there has been a refusal to acknowledge that real pain is being caused in the labour market by Conservative Members willingness to tolerate its existence. We had an example of that this morning, when they refused to say that any level of pay, no matter how low, was intolerable.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady must not slide away from the point. I have explained why Mr. Gavin Laird does not believe that statutory wage fixing at a minimum level will work in this country. The hon. Lady told the Committee that that was different from wages councils. Wages councils are statutory bodies that set minimum wages, and she cannot argue that they are different. However, if she chooses to do so, why does the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) argue that it will not be necessary to reinstate wages councils because he will introduce a minimum wage?<br><br>
The hon. Lady should explain why Mr. Gavin Laird is a neo-classical liberal, along with the rest of the Committee, whom she is denouncing for not accepting that wages councils were in the interests of employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Statutory minimum wage levels are set far higher than wages council levels, so, to an extent, the floor would be much higher, and I believe that it should be. Mr.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0690">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 613</span>
Gavin Laird's views are his own. There are millions of people in the trade union movement and I would not pretend to agree with the views of every one of them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Spellar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although there may be differences about Mr. Gavin Laird's views on the issue, they are of no great help to the Minister in dealing with the clause. To fix wages in a particular sector so that the worst employers cannot undercut the better employers is a sustainable position for someone who may still object to a national minimum wage. It may be an interesting, different and wider argument that we could have had in another debate, but it does not help the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his comments.<br><br>
I wish briefly to return to the argument about the burdens on business that Conservative Members advance to justify deregulation of an employer's responsibilities, such as terms and conditions of work, health and safety and so on. We have already discussed such matters as maternity rights. The logic of the argument is that any cost of employment is a burden on employers, which is an unsustainable position.<br><br>
Conservative Members then say that so-called "burdens on business" must be as light as possible and that they include the costs of employing and dismissing workers and training them. Our record on training shows how some of the people who run businesses in our country have reacted to that.<br><br>
We must improve the quality of employment and training if our economy is to succeed in an increasingly competitive world market. Good training, high pay and job security are features of other advanced western economies that are doing much better than our deregulated economy. It is not good enough to say that paying a living wage is a burden on business that should be shifted to the state. As my hon. Friends have pointed out, that means that the burden is just shifted on to taxpayers. That subsidises bad, inefficient and exploitative employers and leaves many people dependent on benefits, which are gradually being cut. It contributes to the consolidation of the one third-two thirds society that I mentioned earlier, makes no economic sense, and is inefficient and morally repugnant.<br><br>
My hon. Friends have described other effects of the abolition of wages councils. I should like to draw attention in particular to the predictions of the Equal Opportunities Commission and others about its effect on the gender gap in pay. Almost 80 per cent. of the industries covered by wages councils employ mainly women. The statutory wage council rate is gender blind and race blind and does not distinguish between part-time and full-time workers. That is only fair, especially when the structure of employment is changing. The need of what could be an advanced industrial base, if we had a Government who would strategically pursue one, is for flexibility. It has been recognised not only by Labour Members but by other enlightened people that discrimination between part-time and full-time work, between women and men and between those from the ethnic minorities and other sections of the work force must end. Although wages councils provide limited protection because their basic rates are so low, they do not discriminate in those ways.<br><br>
The EOC rightly claims that the decision to abolish wages councils is likely to worsen the pay of those who are in the most vulnerable areas of the economy. It is more likely to affect part-timers—who have fewer rights—than
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 614</span>
full-timers. It is more likely to affect black people—who suffer from discrimination at work and are more likely to be in sweated trades and traditionally exploited parts of the labour force—than others, and it is more likely to affect women than men. When the Government say that they want to abolish wages councils, they are saying that they are quite happy for such discrimination to continue. They are removing one of the few remaining barriers preventing it.<br><br>
I find it awkward to defend such a poor right at such a poor level, but we shall only develop an economy that reacts to changes in the world economy if we start to treat our work force not only as human beings but as people with employment rights equally available to all. To the extent that wages councils set a floor, they are to be applauded. Given the downward pressure on pay and conditions caused by the almost permanent recession that we appear to be in and given the extremely high level of unemployment, which makes people more vulnerable and more desparate to hang on to their jobs, the Government's proposal is no less obscene.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak; I feel that I have been awful coy for a while.<br><br>
I think it is important to review the reasons why we have wages councils before we ask the Government why they are considering abolishing them. In 1906, there was a sweated trades exhibition, which caused a hue and cry among the public throughout Great Britain. They demanded that something be done to stop the tragedy continuing, to stop what was more or less the extension of the slave system in Britain. Sir Winston Churchill introduced the wages councils in 1909.I do not believe that much has changed since then. There are still many sweatshops out there and many companies whose operations should be open to scrutiny and whose workers need wages council protection.<br><br>
It is important that Churchill's words should be on the record and that we should consider them as we participate in the debate. On 28 April 1909 Churchill said in the House of Commons:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is a serious national evil that any class of His Majesty's subjects should receive less than a living wage in return for their utmost exertions. It was formerly supposed that the working of the laws of supply and demand would naturally regulate or eliminate that evil …"—</p></blockquote>
the word is "evil"—
<br><blockquote><p>But where you have … no organisation, no parity of bargaining, the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad employer is undercut by the worst … where those conditions prevail you have not a condition of progress, but a condition of progressive degeneration."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 28 April 1909; Vol IV, <i>c</i> 388.]</p></blockquote>
I say categorically that the abolition of the wages councils is wrong, when we consider that companies are breaking the law regarding even the wages council rate. I shall return to that matter.<br><br>
We must protect our people from poverty. The Government and we who have been elected must do everything in our power to eliminate poverty. Every member of the Committee has been sent to Parliament to act in the interests of our constituents and for the good of people who have no right to vote in this place but who have a right to life and to a decent living. Laws that protected them are to be taken away.<br><br>
I am amazed at the Government's attitude to the great British worker. I know that the people of Great Britain can inspire to greatness if they are given the proper tools,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0691">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 615</span>
working conditions and wages. They will ensure that the country produces enough to survive, but everyone is entitled to share in that production. If the Government keep thinking that the British worker cannot take on the French, the Germans or the Americans, they should not be in Government. We need policies to ensure that working people have protection.<br><br>
What is the matter with ensuring that someone has a decent wage and that there is a bedrock below which he cannot sink? People have a right to a wage that does not need to be topped up with income support and all kinds of benefit. It is appalling that Members of Parliament make £31,000 a year but are not prepared to allow a basic minimum wage for the people who make the country survive. I find it embarrassing that members of the Committee have a good living, yet we would deny our people the backing of law to earn a decent wage.<br><br>
We should not be discussing the abolition of wages councils. We should be strengthening them and extending their role to encompass the men to whom the Minister referred earlier—security men. I shall describe a case that is no mythical story plucked out of the air. It is factual. The Minister has a wee smile on his face. He would not smile if he were earning the wage that one of my constituents earns taking that home to his wife and family and paying his mortgage from it.<br><br>
My constituent makes £1.86 an hour; he works hard for that. He must try to keep his family on it. He must try to keep body and soul together. If the Minister believes that any member of the Committee can live on £1.85 an hour, will he let me know? I would find it hard to do so. None of us knows what will happen at the next general election. Many of us could be out on the dole, including many Conservative Members, who would then wish that they had the wages councils to protect them.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hartley Booth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the existence of family income supplement? Will he consider what happened to a small factory in Hackney? It was run by people from Asia whose employees came from Asia, too. They were paid more than 1,000 per cent. more than they had been paid in Bangladesh. The wages council said that the wages were far to small for Britain. As a result, 20 people were put out of work and, two weeks' later, the factory closed. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can deal with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I consider that it is offensive for someone to work and have to have his wages topped up by the Government through income support and other benefits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has referred before to the person in his constituency who earns £1.85 an hour. He said that he finds it offensive that people should have their income topped up by the welfare system. Does he believe that this constituent would thank him if, as a result of the establishment of a statutory minimum wage, he no longer had a job and had to depend on the benefit system for all his income?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the fullness of time, I shall fully answer the Minister and most of the other questions that hon. Members throw at me.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 616</span>
The hon. Member for Finchley (Mr. Booth) referred to a factory. I do not know the details of that but I fully believe that ordinary men and women, no matter where they five, are entitled to receive a fair wage for a fair day's work. I remember reading when I was at school about the abolition of slavery. At that time, the establishment said that Britain would fall apart, that it would not be able to compete in the wide world and that it would become destitute. After slavery was abolished, Britain became greater. We cannot argue and legislate without protecting people.<br><br>
The Minister clearly said he would accept wage slavery and that £1.85 an hour is good enough pay. He asked whether my constituent would want to be unemployed. He would certainly not but neither does he wish to be subject to wage slavery. He wants to make a decent living, so that he can keep body and soul together. He wants to ensure that his house is heated, that his family is fed adequately and that he can go into the world a proud man. He is a proud man, but he believes that the wages council should operate for him, too.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is all very well, but what about the small business men, who are finding things really tough in the recession? Is the hon. Gentleman saying that their costs should be increased, making it impossible for them to continue in business? Does the hon. Gentleman want to destroy jobs in Britain?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have much sympathy for small business men. As a Member of Parliament, I have fought constantly to make things better for them—for instance by trying to help them deal with VAT, with which they have been lumbered by the Government. The Government have much to do to help small businesses. I am sure that the Minister is aware of the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland. I have often written to Ministers about what help small businesses would like. I try to assist small business men in my constituency, and meet them nearly every week. I assure the Minister that they do not criticise the Labour party; they criticise the Government for not doing enough to help them, it is small businesses that will enable more folk to be employed. I do not know many small business men who want to pay slavery wages. Most of them wish to pay decent wages, but they do not receive proper support from the Government to tackle the bad recession. The Government's policies continually inflict more damage.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way to the Minister in a moment. He has many opportunities to speak in the House; I do not.<br><br>
The Minister is a follower of Adam Smith. He might reflect on what Adam Smith said of low wages in "Wealth of Nations". If the Minister does not know, I am ready to tell him:
<br><blockquote><p>"Whenever wages are high, accordingly, we shall always find the workmen more active, diligent and expedious, than when they are low."</p></blockquote>
Low wages will not get this country moving. High wages, good conditions, people feeling vibrant and feeling good—that is the way to riches. Pay them buttons and they will produce buttons. That is not the basis on which the nation was built; it was built on the basis of a work force consisting of confident, trained, educated engineers and educated people among the working class. That is what enabled us to produce the finest ships in the world and to invent television. The greatest nation was enabled by their

production to go further. Do not criticise them, saying that the working men and women of this country cannot achieve greatness. They are the folk who will get us out of the hole, not the Goverment's mismanagement.<br><br>
Can I go further?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend.<br><br>
The Government wish to abolish the wages councils. They tell us that they care about our citizens. The Prime Minister has issued the citizens charter, the parents charter, the employers charter and the justice charter. Then, lo and behold, they issue the best one of all—the job seekers charter. Those on my patch will not get many jobs. What is the matter with a wages council charter? What is wrong with the wages councils? The Prime Minister will probably come back from India with a vindaloo charter, to tell us what curry we should eat. It is unacceptable in this day and age for people to work for £1.85 an hour. It is wrong that the Government should allow that and continually subsidise employers who pay low wages.<br><br>
The Minister and his supporters have told us that the abolition of the wages councils will result in extra jobs. A Low Pay Unit briefing states.
<br><blockquote><p>"The loss of the wages councils would lead to significant reduction in the purchasing power of the low paid, which would not necessarily be confined to the wages council sector. There is likely to be an unemployment penalty for removing minimum wage protection, particularly in the midst of a recession and depressed retail sales, the scale of which is currently being assessed by the TUC".</p></blockquote>
If ordinary men and women cannot purchase washing machines, hoovers, spin dryers, food and clothes, there will be more unemployment. Abolition of wages councils will not create jobs.<br><br>
Ian McNicoll of the Fraser of Allander Institute carried out a survey on remodelling the Scottish economy and extended input/output matrices for the Scottish economy. Scottish Enterprise published that survey, which covered jobs created by spending by different income groups. It made the important point that yuppies create fewer jobs than ordinary workers. In 1989 people with lower incomes created more than 30 jobs for every £1 million final spending power. People with more than £550 a week created only 22 jobs. Cuts in incomes which are already too low will cost jobs in Scotland, as is clearly the Government's intention.<br><br>
I have the facts and figures arising from that research and I could go on and on, but the important point is that people with low incomes must spend their incomes on food, clothing and shelter. They create jobs and if the Minister removes that spending power, there will be not more jobs but fewer jobs and more unemployment. Instead of a wee top-up, we shall have to pay the unemployed £9,800 a year to keep them on the dole. Is that the future that the Government are suggesting for people in a low-wage economy? Surely not.<br><br>
The tax bonanza for inflation-beating high earners only lines the pockets of those who create fewer jobs. Income-related state benefits—for example, family credit—will rise if minimum wage protection is removed. Family credit expenditure currently amounts to well over £600 million. I hope that that answers the point raised by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald). Facts will prove that family income supplement will need to rise.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 618</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nobody in the Committee would advocate low wages. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have not considered what happens if an employer is able to pay a wage which an employee is willing to accept but which the employer is prevented by statute from paying. The employee becomes unemployed, he claims more benefit and has a lower income than would otherwise be the case. What does the hon. Gentleman have to say about that situation, which pertains when wages councils destroy jobs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Minister—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman may not say that. He has done very well so far.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Minister—[<i>Laughter.</i>] I have my hearing aid but I am not picking up what Conservative Members are saying. Is the Minister saying that a wage of £1.85 an hour is acceptable? Is he saying that wages of 40p, 48p and £1 an hour for young kids who have left school are acceptable? Does the Minister sincerely believe in his heart that such wages are right and proper?</span></p>
<p>5.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try again. I accept that £1.85 an hour is a low wage. However, I ask the hon. Gentleman to say what happens when an employer, perhaps because his business is a victim of the current recession, is unable to pay an employee the agreed rate? If the hon, Gentleman had his way and the threshold was set at a wage level above what the employer could pay, the employer would have to sack the employee. Does the hon. Gentleman argue that that is better? If the hon. Gentleman's argument is that it is wrong for the employee to be dependent on the benefit system in so far as his income may be topped up by family credit or income support, is not it a great deal worse to have the policy that he advocates, which would result in people being put on to the unemployment register? Unemployment is the biggest single cause of poverty and lack of purchasing power. The evil described by the hon. Gentleman—which we accept is an evil—is one that would be caused by the poverty that he advocates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister described low pay of £1.85 an hour as evil. That evil rate has been paid at Coalport, a Government establishment, to workers who guard the security of this country.<br><br>
In response to the Minister's point, let me give him an analogy. Suppose I go into an Asda shop and pick up a loaf, a pint of milk, half a dozen eggs and two tins of beans. I go up to the check-out lassie and ask her, "How much is that?" She replies "£4.50, Mr. Graham." What would happen were I to reply, "Well, I'm sorry but I've only got £4 with me—will you do a wee bit of bargaining?" She would tell me to get on my bike because she would have her wages to make. If an employer is in business to make profit, he must pay appropriate wages.<br><br>
I am sure that if that hypothetical business man or employer were to go to Rolls-Royce and demand to buy a car, he would be quoted a price and told that he could take it or leave it. If he went to buy plumbing or lighting materials, he would have to pay the going rate. So why should not he pay the going price for labour? I do not believe that Britain will ever get back on its feet by having a low-wage economy.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 619</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. He is becoming a disciple of Adam Smith. Of course he must pay the going price, but that is the market rate and not a rate set by a statutory body.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the logic of the Minister's argument is that any employment that is viable at any level of wages is good. It follows, therefore, that if I can invent a business that is viable by paying 2p an hour, that has to be better than not being in business at all. As long as the market will stand it, that is an acceptable wage level.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Finchley has talked about people who have come from Bangladesh and now, in Britain, they are paid a thousand times more than they were paid in Bangladesh. The logic of the Government's argument seems to be that, if employers can compete with Bangladesh by paying 1,000 times less when the wages councils are shut down, that is good for the British economy. Is not that the Minister's argument?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always grateful to my hon. Friend.<br><br>
There are many ways to twist the story to suit ourselves but I can assure the Committee that I am not attempting to do that. I am firmly of the opinion that people must be entitled to fair pay. A fair wage means the right to keep a house and to have clothing, heating and shelter. Sensible, well-adjusted Governments accept that. Earlier, the Minister knocked the minimum wage. At least other nations accept the concept of a minimum wage—and on the basis not of the 40 per cent. about which the Government talk but of 60 per cent. of earnings.<br><br>
The Government's opposition to the social charter is in line with their abolition of the wages councils. It looks as if we are working a slave economy. I am not being emotional. The Minister told us about illegal pay of £1.85 per hour. Constituents of mine receive that rate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that £1.85 per hour is not a living wage for an individual and that the effects of a dynamic deregulated market system mean that others who are paid higher wages have them cut? Everybody's wages are reduced and deprivation spreads.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely.<br><br>
It is surprising that, even with wages councils, the Government do not carry out the law. Low Pay Unit research shows that there is massive illegal underpayment of wages council rates—about 20 times more than was revealed by the wages inspectorate. The wages inspectorate discovered pay as low as £1.60 per hour. That leads us to believe that abolition could result in pay falling rapidly.<br><br>
I come from a depressed part of the country—Strathclyde. I live in Linwood, which suffered the terrible closure of the Linwood car factory. Over 5,000 jobs were lost and many of the workers are still not working. Others are in low-paid jobs and receive benefit to top up their wages. I do not live in an ivory tower, a castle or a villa. I live in a terraced house in the heart of Linwood. My neighbours on the other side of the wall, across the road and down the street are all unemployed. I know how our people are suffering as a result of low wages and unemployment.<br><br>
I have some scandalous statistics which should never have been allowed to occur in this nation. I have a table of firms, region by region, which pay less than the wages
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 620</span>
council rates. I shall not go through all of it, as that would drive us all draft, but I shall give an example. In Scotland, 737 firms were caught underpaying in 1991. Two were prosecuted. Those working in industries covered by wages councils are living on a bare minimum wage, but in 1991, £180,000 in wage arrears was due. In the whole of Great Britain, almost £1.5 million is due in arrears to people who already live on poverty wages.<br><br>
Had the Government not expressed their disquiet with wages councils in 1979 and moved steadily towards today's lethal proposals, the situation might be better. Perhaps we would have had proper wages and decent conditions, which would have made us more competitive and given our people more heart to compete in the big, bad world.<br><br>
In Britain, 5,971 firms were caught underpaying. Earlier, I heard a statement about inspectors but it is obvious that there are not enough inspectors to scrutinise the low wages paid in this country. The Government have been happy to allow that to continue when they should have acted to improve matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman is criticising the Government for allowing that to continue, perhaps he will confirm that in 1976, under a Labour Government, there was only one prosecution in the United Kingdom and that the policy pursued by successive Government's has been the same.<br><br>
What the hon. Gentleman is saying is highly misleading, but I accept that that is not his fault because he is relying on information from the Low Pay Unit. He will find that in the firms that he cited perhaps only one or two employees were found not to be paid in accordance with the Wages Act 1986. I am not sure whether he is criticising the wages council system or Government's in general, including that formed by his party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may have quoted a wee paragraph from the Low Pay Unit, but those figures came from elsewhere. I believe that they were unearthed by questions asked of successive Governments.<br><br>
I came to the House in 1987. The only history lesson that I want to hear is that we have learnt from our mistakes and want to make progress. We should not hang on to the past unless it provides a good example. Wage councils are decent institutions and they should be improved, not abolished. The Minister could solve the problem by agreeing to the minimum wage, as proposed by the Labour party. I am sure that many people in this country would be delighted to be paid a decent wage of £3.65 an hour, which would solve the problem.<br><br>
The abolition of the wages councils will cause the pay gap between men and women to widen, which may leave the Government open to legal challenge in the European Court. They may be in breach of EC equal pay legislation, which requires member states to take necessary measures to ensure that the principle of equal pay is applied and observed.<br><br>
I wish to bring to the Committee's attention the experience of a member of USDAW, the union which sponsors me. I declared that interest earlier. Mary Paterson works in a fast food restaurant in Stirling. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I've been working all hours for 15 years but I've had to bring my daughters up in poverty. Wages Council rates are hardly a fortune but at least we had some protection. I worry for myself but I also worry about my workmates, our cleaners are not covered by a Wages Council and they earn £2 an hour. Both their wages and my pay will fall if Wages Councils are abolished."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0694">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 621</span>
Another USDAW member, Christine Richardson, who is a shopworker from south Wales, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are millions of people drowning in a sea of poverty and Wages Councils are their lifebelt. This Government wants to take that away from us. Low pay means having to work three hours for a dental check or four hours for an eye test. We work hard all our lives and then they do this. It's demoralising. It's not fair."</p></blockquote>
It is not just unfair but one of the biggest injustices that the Government could inflict on more than 2.5 million people. It is the road to slavery. The Government should realise that they do not have many friends among ordinary working men and women. I have a list of wages from a jobcentre that I am sure the Minister would like to see. In order not to waste the Committee's time, I am delighted to invite the Minister to visit the jobcentre in my constituency, where he would see that many of the wages advertised are miserable, or—as he would say—evil. I also assure him that, when the photographs are taken, I shall be there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I put on record that I did not say that the wages were evil, I said that the evil with which we are concerned is unemployment. The hon. Gentleman appeared to prefer unemployment to low wages.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman has made a great case for the importance of people in my constituency and elsewhere taking home a proper wage. Will he comment on the policy of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, which sponsors him, of denying people the opportunity to work on Sunday?</span></p>
<p>5.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not stray into the Sunday trading debate as I do not want to be called to order. I am surprised. I have always regarded the Minister as someone who stood his ground. Perhaps I was slightly wrong. However, I am convinced that he repeated the words "evil pay". Is not £1.85 evil pay? Is not 40p per hour evil pay? Is not 48p evil pay?<br><br>
The Government say that they listen and consult. I hope that they will listen to what I have to say. The Institute of Management believes that the abolition of wages councils will severely damage United Kingdom productivity. Its director general said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The success of organisations depends on the productivity of their work-force. A low wage policy leads to a vicious circle of low morale, low performance and low productivity. The UK cannot compete in the 1990s with a 19th century approach to labour. The way forward is through higher productivity and higher skill levels created and rewarded by higher pay."</p></blockquote>
Minister, any common sense that you have will tell you quite clearly that the Government, Mr. Knox—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was just going to say that the hon. Gentleman has done very well this afternoon, but he may be tiring after 42 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I am boring the Committee, I shall come to my penultimate point in 25 minutes. Low wages are not good for the country. Lowering morale is not good for the country's productivity. I entirely agree with the Institute of Management.<br><br>
I quoted an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 6 November 1992 on the Floor of the House and I ask Conservative members of the Committee to read it. It says that
<br><blockquote><p>"now, after nine quarters of recession and with the abolition of wages councils tacked on, the employment bill looks even more anachronistic".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 622</span>
Even religious organisations have written to us about the matter. The Religious Society of Friends—the Quakers-wrote:
<br><blockquote><p>"Quaker opposition to the abolition of Wages Councils is based on the conviction that a decent level of pay is essential in a civilized society in order to recognise properly the worth of each human being and provide them with self-respect as well as the means to feed, clothe and house themselves."</p></blockquote>
My union, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Abolition of the Wages Councils would be a direct attack on the living standards of the poorest wage earnes in this country and would leave us as the only country in Europe without any protection for minimum wages. At present 2.5 million people rely on Wages Councils to set minimum rates of pay".</p></blockquote>
After hundreds of years of industrialisation and of making this country what it is, we are not a nation of fools and illiterates. We are a nation of educated people who have fought for democratic rights. We have compassion and try to look after the interests of people suffering in the third world. However, we are about to create on our own doorstep the problems that we have tried to alleviate elsewhere. Thousands of people in Britain are living in poverty and need the Government's assistance and support.<br><br>
I conclude by quoting an editorial, but not one from a Labour paper or one whose editor supports the Labour party. The words are worthy of consideration by the Minister and his colleagues. I quote from the <i>Greenock Telegraph</i> which I am sure the Minister knows does not tend towards Labour party views. I am in a cynical mood. I shall try to speed this up, and I hope that the Minister will understand my Scots accent. The editorial says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Government plans to abolish wages councils are based on the fallacious claim that this will create more jobs. The proposal will be seen as outrageous by all fair-minded people.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>At best it is naive to suggest that doing away with the councils will open up more job opportunities. Low-paid workers are more likely to see this as a general move to allow employers to cut their wages even more.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It is really disgraceful to think that in 1992 some people could be paid as litte as £2.50 an hour, but even that may be considered a helpful supplement to families on the lowest wage levels.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>To suggest that, by abandoning the wages council limit, employers would be persuaded to take on more workers seems to be downright dishonest. Employers will not recruit one more worker if they think they can manage with their existing labour force. Employers will see this as a real opportunity to reduce their labour costs.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The councils were introduced by Winston Churchill in early 1900s. He realised then that, in a fair world, everyone should have a living wage. We are now stepping back in time and forcing wives and mothers who would rather be at home to go out to work for a meagre wage, simply to augment the family income.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It is even worse, of course, in the cases where low wage earners are the only people in the family who have a job. They are often being compelled to work long and unsocial hours, and, even then, do not make enough money to provide the basics for their families.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The shop workers' union, USDAW, will find a great deal of public sympathy for their campaign to stop the government axeing wages councils. Prime Minister John Major is promoted by the Conservatives as being a caring leader, but this image will be tarnished considerably if he proceeds with this regrettable course of action.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It does not make economic sense to risk wholesale slashing of existing wages without the guarantee that more poorly-paid jobs will be created. Cutting people's income will take their money our of the economy and mean they will not be able to afford to buy what many people consider are the basic, essential … items …</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>This, in turn, will feed back to the factories producing these goods and could lead to workers being laid off because demand has dropped for their products. The result of that will be to dig the country even deeper into recession.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0695">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 623</span>
<br><blockquote><p>It is difficult to escape the strong suspicion that the government's motives are simply to please some of their big business supporters who wish to increase profits by cutting their wage bill.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>These businesses, too, could suffer eventually as the vicious circle of wage cuts and reduction in demand feeds back into their own sector of the economy.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It is a recipe for further gloom and depression—and the government should see sense before it is too late."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to support Opposition Members by retaining the wages councils, and to strengthen them to ensure that workers in my constituency do not need to work for a miserable pittance of £1·85 an hour, but have the right to bring home to the family a living wage each week, and not have to try to win lotteries to exist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have heard deeply felt speeches from my hon. Friends who have spoken from the heart and the mind. It would be sensible of the Minister to listen carefully to the points that were made. My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) quoted from several intellectual tomes, one of which I shall refer to later. When she was in the Library researching such documentation, I, for my sins, was in the fiction section reading a document entitled "The Best Future for Britain"—the Conservative party manifesto for the 1992 general election. When hon. Members saw me reading it, it caused some hilarity and several ribald comments were made.<br><br>
In scouring through the document looking for references to wages councils, I found one or two interesting comments that are worthy of consideration. I refer members of the Committee to the foreword of the document, which was signed by the Prime Minister. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I believe strongly that you and not the Government should be in charge of your life."</p></blockquote>
The nearest reference that I could find to the rights of people to be consulted was in the section on workers and the unions. It stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The workers' rights we believe in are those which enhance an individual's status and opportunities. We believe people should be informed and consulted by employers about issues which affect their work."</p></blockquote>
I wonder why that policy does not extend to consultation by the Government. It is no good the Minister saying—as he has done on several occasions—"Ah, well, that was what the general election was about." Nobody was asked about the plight of the 2.5 million workers covered by wages councils and the Government's intentions regarding them.<br><br>
I shall question in a moment some of the statistical evidence that has been given to the Committee. It is a pity that several Conservative Members who made some curious statements on statistics have left the Room, because I can answer some of their questions. The Government should withdraw the clause because it is not only based on a false premise regarding the effect on the economy of wages councils, but it is being presented to us under false pretences.<br><br>
Interesting documents have been supplied to members of the Committee. I thank the organisations that have taken the trouble to supply us with that information, some of which was referred to by the Minister. The Child Poverty Action Group, USDAW, the national organisation representing homeworking, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and the Low Pay Unit have all provided excellent material.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 624</span>
5.45 pm<br><br>
The Minister intervened on my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey and made a cynical remark about the role of volunteers in our society. The organisations that provided the information—they all argue for the continuation of wages councils—are dominated and run by volunteers. Perhaps the Minister will comment on the validity of" volunteers arguing that people in other parts of society should have a better share of the nation's wealth than is allowed by the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Hanson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend said about the representations that we have received. Like other hon. Members, I have received a mountain of mail about the abolition of wages councils, before the Bill was published and during the Committee stage. I suspect that, like other hon. Members, I am not alone in receiving not one letter from constituents, organisations or companies in support of the Government's proposition. Perhaps, in due course, the Minister will comment on that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an interesting point. He asks for information from the Minister. I join him in so asking, because the Government say that "You, not the Government, should be in charge of your life". There should have been widespread consultation. That point was made admirably by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey when she argued the case for slowing the process. Not only is there conflict about the validity of the Minister's argument about the information available to us, but the argument is one-sided.<br><br>
Several interventions have been made about the basis of the Government's statistical analysis. I do not intend to give a lecture about how dubious the Government's statistical process is. Putting a hat on from a previous life, I would happily give the Government some advice on how statistical systems should operate. I shall quote Lord Gilmour, perhaps not the favoured son of Conservative Members. In his book, "Dancing with Dogma", which is dedicated to the officers and members of the Cheshunt and Amersham Conservative association, he states that
<br><blockquote><p>"The 1985 Government paper on wages and employment, designed to show that minimum wages cost jobs, which was often quoted by Ministers, was not a Government Economic Service working paper, was based on very dubious assumptions and, not surprisingly, had no identifiable author."</p></blockquote>
Lord Gilmour was referring to a paper called, "The Relationship between Employment and Wages, Review by Treasury Officials" dated January 1985. If the Minister wants to enter into a discussion outside the Room—because it is not relevant to the Committee—about the value of statistics that have been used in the debate, I would welcome the opportunity. The Conservative party claims to be the party of the individual. I want to demonstrate that that is a complete and utter myth. Earlier, I thanked several organisations for supplying me with information. I must add to that list my thanks to Mr. Coomber from the Conservative Research Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the paper to which the learned Gentleman is referring the paper that was produced by the Treasury in 1985 entitled, "The Relationship between Employment and Wages"? If it is, it is not a research study. That paper examined several studies, including Beenstock

and Warburton in 1984 and Nickell and Andrews in 1983. It is a survey of academic work, which I have never before heard questioned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that intervention. It is not for me to promote other people's writings, but I suggest that the Minister reads "Dancing with Dogma".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would rather not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an interesting book. The words that I quoted come directly from Lord Gilmour's text. Rather than engage in a statistical debate with me, the Minister should, perhaps, engage in a debate with Lord Gilmour.<br><br>
The paper from the Conservative Research Department makes interesting reading. There are about 26 wages councils covering 2.5 million workers and 250,000 employers. In other words, on average, 10 workers per employer are covered by the wages councils and some 400,000 workplaces are covered. In each of those workplaces, on average just over six employees are covered. So we are considering extremely small groups of people and, in many cases, individuals. The Minister criticised some of the contributions of my hon. Friends, on the grounds that wages council investigations often relate to only one or two people.<br><br>
I hope that hon. Members will bear those points in mind when I refer to the document. We are dealing with a Government who believe in the cult of the individual but who, in their attempt to abolish the wages councils, are standing on their head. The paper says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government has, for a long time now, made it clear that Wages Councils have no permanent place in the workplace."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the word "permanent" will tempt the Minister to consider the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras—that there may be some benefits in delaying the implementation of the clause.<br><br>
The paper continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Wages Councils set off a spiral of wage inflation. If employers are required to give their lowest paid staff increases of 5 per cent. they would find it hard to avoid giving their higher paid employees the same increases."</p></blockquote>
That point needs to be reinforced. There are plenty of examples of employers who give their employees an increase of 5 per cent. and who find it acceptable at the same time to give the directors increases of 20 or 30 per cent. How on earth can there be any logic in that? It is a nonsense. Employers could, if they wished, negotiate sensible increases with their employees. Companies have representation on wages councils and can make representations in the same way as employee organisations.<br><br>
The paper goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Wages Council are an anachronism. The world of 1992 is very different to that of 1909. Lower paid workers are, today, covered by a vast array of benefits."</p></blockquote>
I bet that that has caused controversy among Conservative Members. Is the paper suggesting that benefits should be taken away?<br><br>
Low-paid young people have already been referred to. I refer the Minister to an example in my constituency in which a young woman—a YTS trainee—is suffering from a life-threatening illness. She cannot afford all her prescriptions because she has to pay for them. She has to choose which medication to take. It is extraordinary to argue that low-paid workers are covered by a vast array of benefits and to use that argument to support the abolition
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 626</span>
of wages councils. The Government, who regulate that young worker's allowance, accept that that level of low pay is acceptable. That is not a tasteful example, but it is true and has been the subject of correspondence between myself and the appropriate Ministers—so far, to no avail.<br><br>
Hon. Members have made frequent references in the debate to individuals who, by and large, work in industries which are renowned as low-pay industries—security, the rag trade and parts of the retail sector. My direct experience of wages councils is a case involving one of the larger corporations, BTR Plc. That company is not renowned as a high-pay company, but as it operates in the manufacturing sector one would have expected poverty wages not to be an issue.<br><br>
The case concerned a club steward who was employed by the company to work in a club, managed by the company on company premises, that provides services to the employees. The steward was just over 60. He had a severe heart attack and his wife stood in for him as the acting steward. The case resulted in a wages council investigation which led to an award under the wages council regulations which proved that that giant corporation, BTR, had underpaid this gentleman for several years, had underpaid his wife and had failed to give him proper holiday pay and sickness benefits. The award, which was backdated for the two years that the wages council are allowed to backdate awards, was more than £12,500. That was the extent of the exploitation.<br><br>
I regret to say that the gentleman involved has recently died. Had not it not been for the wages council, his surviving partner would now be living in absolute poverty. That gentleman's case, and the associated award—I am sure that the legal minds among those on the Conservative Benches will realise that a subsequent breach of contract action was heard in another place—hinged on the wages council award. His circumstances were that because he was living in company premises, he had no home and no hope of finding proper accommodation. Only because of the direct involvement of the wages council system did that gentleman and his partner have anything like a reasonable life after his retirement.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey referred to vulnerable groups of workers. I have shown that, contrary to what Conservative Members have said, such examples are to be found not exclusively among low-paid industries or among young people. Some have referred to the words of Gavin Laird. The Minister can pluck examples at random to suit his argument, as we heard earlier in our proceedings, what he failed to point out was that some employers are on record as saying that they are opposed to the Government's action. A representative from the Yorkshire and Humberside CBI stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"A lot of small firms don't want to be wasting time in protracted negotiations with their people. It can detract them from the main task of running the small firm. And if they had a well-established national level of wages then that takes a lot of the hassle out."</p></blockquote>
The citizens advice bureaux in my constituency and the Low Pay Unit in Manchester have sometimes received queries from employers on what is a reasonable level of pay and what is a reasonable length of holiday in specific circumstances in specific trades. When reference has been made to wages councils rates, those employers have expressed their gratitude and said that that takes away the hassle.<br><br>

As someone who in a former life dealt with statistics every day, I shall conclude by making one or two points about the comments during interventions and especially that of the hon. Member who referred to the Bangladeshi situation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Finchley.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Finchley should have been on the tip of my tongue. I was going to quote the previous Member of Parliament for Finchley, but thought it inappropriate as I did not want to upset Conservative Members too much.<br><br>
I refer to a source that all members of the Committee accept as legitimate. In its research note No. 92/75 on wages councils, the Library published a table showing the number of workers covered by each wages council and the current minimum pay rates. The hon. Member for Finchley suggested that thousands of workers would be driven out of work because of the continuation of wages councils.<br><br>
First, that is demonstrably not the case historically, either here or in countries which have a minimum wage. Secondly, the suggestion is manifestly untrue: of those 2.5 million workers, almost 2.4 million are in occupations where there is no competition from overseas. Workers in a retail outlet, whether run by Burger King or McDonald's, or in a licensed residential establishment or in the retail food sector are not subject to wage competition from external sources. It is the governance over rates of pay, holidays and conditions that creates an equilibrium. Those are minimum standards set out by the Government, through the wages councils. Those workers cannot be considered to be at risk because of changes in wages and conditions as a result of wages council involvement. The relatively small number of people, particularly in the textile sector and associated sectors, who fall outside the equation, must be covered by general regulations.<br><br>
The Government have told us on several occasions how successful they have been in speeding up and resolving issues concerning the general agreement on tariffs and trade. If there is genuine, fair competition throughout the world, the example with which the hon. Member for Finchley tried to scare the Committee is nonsense. That can be illustrated by reference to correspondence with the Fertiliser Manufacturers Association, with whom I have contact because of a large factory in my constituency. It is run by a high-pay company, I am pleased to say.<br><br>
The company was under threat because of poor, cheap standards of manufacture in conditions which could not be tolerated because of health and safety risks to both the public and the work force. The company suffered because of imports from the former Soviet Union and from Poland. As a result of the Government's direct intervention, the Fertiliser Manufacturers Association has led me to believe that a resolution is forthcoming. If the problem explained by the hon. Member for Finchley is valid, it can be resolved by Government intervention similar to that which applied to the factory in my constituency.<br><br>
If conservative Members want a lecture in the finesse of statistics, that is for another place. The Government's actions are based on sheer dogma. Their attitude has no sound economic logic. They have no basis upon which to claim a mandate from the public to pursue these proposals. I urge the Government to withdraw this ham fisted clause.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 628</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In our debates on other Amendments it has been our custom to say that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee want to head towards the same destination but each side has a different way of getting there. The hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) made the same observation about these Amendments. I think that he was entirely. wrong about that. Indeed, I think that he is entirely wrong about many things. I think that there is an absolutely fundamental difference between Conservative and Opposition Members about the Amendments, their intention and the purpose of the clause.<br><br>
The proposal to abolish wages councils sums up some of the most grotesque idelogical prejudices that we have seen coming from the Conservative party recently. We have got used to Conservative Members saying that they are prepared to tolerate inequality and poverty but the idea that inequality and poverty, should not just be tolerated but increased, furthered and deepened in order to increase prosperity is not only wrong but outrageous.</span></p>
<p>[Sir Michael Neubert <i>in the Chair]</i></p>
<p>The Hon. Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes) quoted examples of employers, perhaps in his own constituency and from one close by, who break the law by paying illegal wages. I would imagine that, on virtually any other subject, the hon. Gentleman would be a stout defender of law and order, but when it comes to illegal undepayment of employees, suddenly he takes offence at a suggestion by opposition Members that such people are bad employers</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Sykes <span class='memberconstituency'>(Scarborough)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is welcome to visit my constituency whenever he likes. He will receive a warm welcome regardless of which party he belongs to. If he does pay a visit, he should remember what I actually said: one hundred per cent. of the jobs advertised in the jobcentre, were below the Labour party's proposed minimum wage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I apologise to the hon. Gentleman. Would he countenance and condone illegal underpayment of wages council rates?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sykes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must know that no one can condone illegal actions. I would also like him to propose a public apology to my constituents.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As somebody who has lived a large part of my life in Yorkshire, I know the constituency of Scarborough well and the levels of pay that prevail in parts of that area. I think that the hon. Gentleman's constituents would have no difficulty in finding their beliefs echoed, by Opposition members of the Committee.<br><br>
We have heard some strange statements and ideas from Conservative members of the Committee. Suddenly there was a rustle of activity when the word Churchill was mentioned. Suddenly, we were told that, at that stage in his political life, Churchill was a Liberal and not a Conservative. Suddenly, I was getting the idea that not only Winston Churchill but Lord Gilmour are regarded as dangerous pinkos by Conservative members of the Committee. They really must do better than that to convince not just Committee members but people outside the House that their proposals are anything more than a mean-minded attempt to have a go at low-paid people.<br><br>
Conservative Members have advanced two broad arguments to justify the abolition of wages councils.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 629</span>
The first argument is that they are somehow unnecessary, that more than 80 per cent. of employees in those industries are paid above wages council rates and that, if they were abolished, pay would not fall. Another broad argument is that wages councils are a barrier to employment, with the implication that the wages paid to employees in the industries that they cover are too high. Conservative Members must make up their mind about those arguments. They cannot have it both ways. They cannot, on the one hand, claim that wages councils are irrelevant because workers in the industries that they cover are paid above their rates and, on the other, constantly argue that not only wage rates but wage rises in those industries have been so high that they form a barrier to employment. That is a logical impossibility.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Robert Spink <span class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has missed a third argument, which is that the wages councils generate unnecessary bureaucracy and add to the burdens of business. They burden the taxpayer and so depress the economy. As we heard from the hon. Gentleman's mouth a few moments ago, they act to no good effect, as two thirds of the workers covered by them receive more than the minimum wage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I shall return to the issue of democracy. He spoke about burdens on the taxpayer, but we should bear in mind the point made by my hon. Friends: that if wages councils were abolished, a greater burden would inevitably be placed on social security payments, which would impose a greater burden on the taxpayer. But Conservative Members may believe that that scenario would not occur because the Government intend to cut social security benefits still further. In that event, I accept that no further burden would be imposed on the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Spink</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way and I shall not interrupt him again. Does not he accept that my hon. Friend the Minister provided clear evidence this morning that there will be no increase in the family credit and income support burden as a result of abolishing the wages councils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and a number of Conservative Members attempted to show that the removal of young workers from wages council protection did not lead to a fall in their pay. Opposition Members have produced different evidence, which I believe to be more soundly based. For example, we referred to the Greater Manchester low pay unit, but the Minister did not seem to know the size of the sample that it used. I believe that we are right and it is clear that the Minister believes that he and his hon. Friends are right. Opposition Members have said that there is an easy way of testing the truth by allowing time for further consultation on the issue of the abolition of wages councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot have been listening at the point in the debate to which my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Dr. Spink) referred. It was the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) who did not know the size of the sample used by the Greater Manchester low pay unit when I asked him about it. I told the Committee that I wrote to that unit to point out that the 1992 figures were based on 30 vacancies displayed in job centres. Opposition Members did not seek
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 630</span>
to contradict that. Surely the hon. Gentleman, who is a fair-minded man, would not choose to base his argument on such a fragile framework.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but perhaps he has forgotten that at that point in the debate my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras quoted the size of the sample. It covered a total of 66, not 30, vacancies. Those were all the vacancies available in Greater Manchester at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that that is wrong, but that was the information provided by people who carried out the survey and I believe that they had greater knowledge of the matter than the Minister.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that, based on walking round jobcentres and looking at 30 vacancies, it is possible to draw conclusions about what has happened to young people's pay? Is that the basis of his argument? Was that the basis of the study?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The basis of the study was empirical evidence from Manchester. The Minister's original point was that the size of the sample was 30. It was not. We have been told that by the people who carried out the study. The Minister should take up the matter with them and also allow time for consultation on the Government's crazy proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman says that the sample was not 30 vacancies—incidentally, the 1989 paper was based on 13 vacancies—what was it? Even if it was 60 or 100, how can he pit that against the evidence to which my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point referred, which was based on a sample of more than 1,000 and which studied the labour force across the country? It was compiled by statisticians who are independent of Ministers. The hon. Gentleman is ruining a good case by relying on flimsy evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for conceding that the Opposition have a good case. We certainly believe that we do. The sample of 66 was based on all the cases available in one city at that time, and they all pointed in the same direction. I would argue that that is more valid than a nationwide survey that, on a city-by-city and town-by-town basis, probably added up to less in each case. The Greater Manchester low pay unit sample is perfectly reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras that, on a statistical basis and compared with the overall population, the Manchester sample is twice as big as the sample to which the Minister referred, which was drawn from the whole country. He should undertake a much more detailed investigation which would lead to consultation and examination. It is surprising that he has not done so. Statistically, the Manchester survey is twice as large as the national figures that the Minister cites.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. If the Minister is interested in potential problems arising from selectivity of evidence and from figures being cited only when they support the argument, he should consider the claims that have been made by his hon. Friends.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 631</span>
Several parliamentary questions have been tabled to the Minister and his hon Friends about the studies undertaken into the potential effects of the abolition of wages councils. Two attempts at answers have been quite good in terms of listing the number of responses that the Department had received. The answers have sometimes been less than clear in listing the content of the responses. For example the study by Craig and Wilkinson in 1986 was never listed in response to those questions, even though it was within the total. That was a Department of Employment research paper. The Minister seemed to have difficulty with anything published by the Low Pay Unit, but the Craig and Wilkinson study said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It was unlikely that lower wages could induce a significant increase in employment … Few of the firms volunteerd the view that the level of pay on its own was an important determinant of their employment policy".</p></blockquote>
The LSE study carried out by Machin and Manning in 1992 said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We have found that the toughness of the regulation imposed by the Wages Councils has declined in the 1980s, that this has been a contributory factor to rising inequality in the covered industries, but that there is no evidence of an increase in employment from the decline in the effectiveness of the Wages Councils. If anything, our conclusions are that employment has declined as a result of the decreasing effectiveness of the Wages Councils … The current UK Government has argued that the Wages Council system should be abolished on the grounds that it has reduced employment. Our results suggest that the evidence for this view is at best weak and that the abolition of the Councils may do no more than substantially increase wage inequality."</p></blockquote>
That evidence was presented to the Government. The fact that they had received evidence from those studies was listed in parlimentary answers, but the content has never been presented. Why not, if the Government are so keen that such an important subject should be debated?<br><br>
There is no clear evidence—indeed, the evidence points to the contrary—that low-wage and ultimately a low-skill economy, as the Government seem to want, leads to a growth in employment. If the existence of wages councils drove down employment, why, in several of the service sectors covered by wages councils, did employment increase through the 1980s? The drop-off since then has nothing to do with the existence of wages coucils, because thay were already there. It has much more to do with the economic downturn and recession, which cannot be blamed on wages councils but only on the policies of the Government. But the Government persist in advancing that view.<br><br>
It was suggested earlier in the debate by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North that international comparisons showed that minimum wage legislation automatically produced higher unemployment. When asked to provide evidence by Labour members of the Committee, he used his Conservative party briefing that said, "When asked for that, quote the example of France." Let us consider France.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman slightly misrepresents what I said. I was making the point that the figures for youth unemployment are stark and clear. In countries with minimum wages, youth unemployment levels are far higher. I referred to three countries: France, Spain and Greece.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that minimum wages covering young people drive down employment, but minimum wages that cover workers as a whole do not?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 632</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I made referred specifically to the argument being advanced that young people in this county are suffering far worse than those in other countries. My point was that that is simply not correct. In countries with minimum wage legislation for young people, they do not get jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will find that there is~ general minimum wage legislation in those countries. For the record, let us compare the unemployment rates in France with those in Great Britain. Conservative Members are fond of quoting the straight unemployment percentages for the period between 1986 and 1991. In France it was 10.4 per cent. in 1986, while in the United Kingdom it was 11.6 per cent.—a bit higher. In 1987, it was 10.5 per cent. in France and 10.4 per cent. in Britain. In 1988, it was 10 per cent. in France and 8.3 per cent. in Britain. In 1989, it was 9.4 per cent. in France and 6.1 per cent. in Britain. In 1990, it was 9 per cent. in France and 5.5 per cent. in Britain. In 1991, it was 9.3 per cent. in France and 7.9 per cent. in Britain.<br><br>
In case any Conservative members of the Committee quote any such figures later in the debate, let us remember that that does not compare like with like.<br><br>
Let us consider the standardised unemployment statistics, which allow us to compare like with like between France and Britain. In 1986, France had 10.4 per cent. unemployment, Great Britain had 11.2 per cent. In 1987, France had 10.5 per cent.; Great Britain 10.3 per cent.—that one is lower. In 1988, France had 10 per cent. and Great Brtain 8.5 per cent.—still lower. In 1989, France had 9.4 per cent.; Great Britain 7.1 per cent. In 1990, the figures were 8.9 per cent. compared with 6.9 per cent. but in 1991 they are exactly the same: 9.4 per cent. Those are the standardised unemployment statistics. They provide no evidence that minimum wage legislation produced higher unemployment. The difference between the unstandardised and standardised British unemployment rate is about 19 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will let me make some progress.<br><br>
Even assuming that minimum wage legislation has an effect on employment levels, do Conservative members of the Committee consider it acceptable that someone should be paid less than £2.50 an hour or the princely sum of about £3.20 an hour, which is right at the top of wages council rates? The Government had never said whether that is acceptable to them.<br><br>
Abolition of wages councils will inevitably drive those already low rates down even lower. It has been argued that it will affect women disproportionately. The briefing from Conservative central office stated that that would not be so, and that it would affect both sexes equally. Of the people who are covered by wages councils, 80 per cent. are women, If the councils are scrapped, it will lead to a depression of wages. It must do so if the proposal is to create the extra employment that Conservative Members say that it will, and women will be affected disproportionately.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
It seems that Conservative Members acknowledge that to some extent. A standard form of wording is contained in any letter that is sent from the Department of Employment to anyone who writes to it querying the removal of wages
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0700">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 633</span>
councils. I refer to a letter to the chair of the Equal Opportunities Commission from the Secretary of State for Employment. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"You say that Wages Councils, act as a minimum wage protection for low paid women but, in fact, about two-thirds of all Wages Councils workers are paid significantly above the Council minima."</p></blockquote>
We have established today that that is not true. The workers may be paid more than the minima, but significantly more than that has not been proved. The letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"Moreover, most Wages Council workers work part-time; contributing a second income to the family home."</p></blockquote>
I shall now read out to the Committee part of a letter from the Minister of State, Department of Employment to the group secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union. It contains wording that is probably from the same word processor. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Most of the workers covered by Wages Councils are not poor; many work part-time and live in households with two or more earners. Evidence shows that there is no close link between the wage rates of such workers and their households' total income."</p></blockquote>
Interestingly enough, some of the statistics quoted in the letter are subtly different from those quoted in the letter to the Secretary of State, but I shall attribute that to a word processing error.<br><br>
A letter to the national women's secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union from the Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Employment states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Moreover, most Wages Councils workers work part time contributing a second income to the family home. Evidence shows that there is no close link between the wage rates of such workers and their household income."</p></blockquote>
I have drawn attention to three arguments that the loss of wages councils will not have a disproportionate effect on women, because of the preponderence of second incomes. That is the Government's view. Those who wrote the letters are the people who became so upset on Second Reading. We said that their view was that scrapping wages councils did not matter in respect of women's pay, because women work for pin money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were upset on Second Reading because Opposition Members accused my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State of having described women who were covered by wages council as working for pin money, when that expression is used by the Left, the Equal Opportunities Commission and others. The expression has never been used by my right hon. Friend or anyone else. In the House, that patronising term has been the exclusive preserve of Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify what he understands by the term "pin money"?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give the hon. Gentleman such a definition. It is as follows:
<br><blockquote><p>"Pin money was an allowance made by a husband to his wife for her separate personal expenses and was usually provided for in a settlement by a yearly rent charge on a husband's real estate".</p></blockquote>
The source of that definition was the case Howard <i>v.</i> Ear, of Digby in 1834. There are other definitions, but the term relates to the 19th century when a different view of women prevailed from that which is held by Conservative Members. I am shocked and appalled that Opposition Members continue to use it.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 634</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that definition. It implies that pin money is such only if a woman does not have an adequate independent income. In the Minister's example, the money was given by the husband to the wife and was therefore pin money. The argument seems to be that wages councils predominantly cover women employees, and that it does not matter if those wages fall because they are only second incomes. What is the logical difference between that and the argument about pin money?<br><br>
Women deserve and have the right to expect decent wages. We should abolish the gender gap in wage rates, employment and earnings, not increase it. Conservative Members seem to take the view that if two incomes are coming into a house, the right of the woman to have an independent income or to earn decent wages on her own account suddenly goes out of the window. Suddenly, it is not important; it is merely a second income. I could overlook that mistake if it was made only once, but it seems to appear on all the Department's letters about the effect of the abolition of wages councils on women's wages.<br><br>
That issue may not be clarified here. It deserves to be debated by the Nation, and it needs to be tested elsewhere. That is another reason for seeking to amend the Bill. Conservative Members are probably aware that considerable doubt has been expressed about whether the proposal to abolish wages councils is lawful under article 119 of the treaty of Rome, which provides for equal treatment between men and women under the various equality directives.<br><br>
The abolition of wages councils will not only drive down women's wages but will undermine the improvements that Conservative members seek for maternity rights. They have said that they will not discus how maternity pay will be affected by the Bill, but maternity pay and maternity leave are only partially relevant. If women's wages are driven down, more women's wages will be driven below the threshold. A higher percentage of women will then qualify for maternity leave, but their right to a decent income to go with it will be reduced. That is a matter not only for the Commitee; it needs to be tested in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Joyce Quin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may remember that the Government took some pride a few years ago in taking modest steps towards the independent taxation of men and women. They are now in danger of completely contradicting themselves, by treating women's wages as a second income rather than an income in its own right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend is, of course, entirely right. The Government's own words, set out in the Department's letters, show that that is their view. They seem to believe that wages need to be driven down to create employment. We have heard story after story about employers not being able to afford to pay decent wages. One of them mentioned in the Conservative central office briefing, was Grand Metropolitan, which gave an independent opinion on the subject of wages councils. The central office briefing stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"Grand Metropolitan has said that the system acts as a significant barrier to the building of an effective rewards system and it is increasingly difficult to understand how such a system … consistently produces settlements in excess of the general level negotiated in industry'."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0701">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 635</span>
Conservative Members are urged to quote such examples by central office. The chief executive and chairman of Grand Metropolitan was paid no less than £713,591 last year by a company that says that it cannot afford to pay workers a decent living wage. Such views are repugnant.<br><br>
Low pay is a problem. Examples of criminal underpayment are legion in my part of the West Midlands. Not only are wages council rates too low, but employers pay below those rates. One example from Birmingham concerns a 33 year old cafe assistant who works 25 hours a week for £2 an hour. Her legal entitlement is £73. She has worked for her employer for 10 months. If she tried to do anything about her pay—to bargain voluntarily in the way urged by Conservative Members—her employer could sack her on the spot and she would be unable to do anything because she has been employed for only 10 months and has virtually no employment rights.<br><br>
This is an employments rights Bill, so why are the Government not more concerned about tackling underpayment instead of scrapping wages councils? There are about three times as many workplaces for wages council inspectors to inspect as there were in 1979. What action is the Government taking to track down those establishments and do something about them? Absolutely nothing. It is strange that they have such a cavalier attitude to lawbreaking concerning wages councils, even though they know that each year about one third of the companies that are inspected are found to be paying below the lawful rates. The Government have evidence of illegal underpayment, but what do they do about that?<br><br>
I asked the Library to check up on the ratio of wages council inspectors to employees covered by wages councils. That ratio is about 1:40,950. That shows how much importance Conservative Members attach to tracking down lawbreakers. A few months ago, the Secretary of State for Social Security said at the Conservative party conference that it was important to track social security fraud and lawbreakers. It is interesting to see the ratio of Benefits Agency staff involved: it is difficult to work out from the Library's figures who should be included as claimants, but taking the generous figures of people in receipt of child benefit, retirement pensioners, people on income support and so on, the ratio was 1:14,000. Illegality involving social security claimants seems to be more important than illegality involving employers who pay poverty wages. Let us consider tax inspectors and how much importance the Government attach to tax fraud. The ratio there is 1:3,000.<br><br>
We have clear evidence that the Government, who describe the Bill as covering employment rights and talk at length about the need to free up employment and allow proper bargaining between employers and employees, are failing abjectly to track down and do something about illegal underpayment.<br><br>
I asked the hon. Member for Scarborough whether he condoned underpayment and he said, to his credit, that he did not. I challenge the Government to do something about underpayment. Instead of proceeding with the abolition of wages councils, why do they not increase the number of wages inspectors and ensure that they do their job properly? The Government may then discover that the extent of the illegal underpayment about which they know is the tip of the iceberg; they may realise the real value of wages councils and the need for them to be strengthened
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 636</span>
instead of scrapped and they may decide that the notional links between higher wages and lower employment do not exist. They may also find out the extent of the deprivation and poverty in the society that they have created during the past 13 or 14 years. They may conclude, as Opposition Members have done, that poverty should not be tolerated and should certainly not be increased. It should be, eradicated by retaining wages councils and by increasing their scope. In the longer term the scourge of low pay should be eradicated in the most effective way by introducing national minimum wage. We are proud of that policy and we are proud of the fact that we want to eradicate poverty, not increase it.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hutton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate. We are discussing a significant event. It has been brought to the attention of the Committee that wages council have been in operation for more than 80 years. They were introduced in this House by the Liberal Winston Churchill. Today marks the end of wages councils.<br><br>
It is a privilege for me, as a new Member of Parliament, to be involved in this debate. I hope that, as a result of today's discussion, the Government will change their mind. At best, the Government's case for abolishing wages council can be described as wishful thinking, in the sense that they hope that abolishing them will lead to an increase in the number of jobs and lift the burden from the backs of employers. I say "wishful thinking" because there is no economic evidence to suggest that abolishing wages council will increase the number of jobs. We have heard from the Minister little snippets of convoluted attempts to torture the data until it confesses. We have heard a tawdry patchwork of inconclusive economic data that, in his unique way, the Minister has moulded into a case for abolishing wages councils. A more realistic description of the Government's intentions would be the cynical condoning of exploitation by empoyers, who could and should be required to pay minimum wage rates.<br><br>
Another issue has been raised today, which lies at the heart of our debate on the amendments. During the debate, and on Second Reading, the Government have shown their fundamental hostility towards the notion that it is an appropriate use of out power to set minimum employment rights. Underlying the Government's case is the belief, foolishly held, that we can improve employment conditions by abolishing all statutory minimum employment rights. Only very reluctantly and in limited circumstances will the Government consider establishing those employment rights when they are forced to do so by the European Court of Justice.<br><br>
If we look back over the past few years of the century, we see that every significant social advance for men and women who work in Britain has arisen out of legislation in this House. Employers will not spontaneously, of their own free will and volition, suddenly decide to improve the working conditions of men and women. They are not ultimately philanthropic. If the Committee were to instruct employers to maintain minimum employment rights, they would have no choice but to observe those conditions and, eventually, they would understand the benefit of the improvements. In the speeches of Conservative Members we have heard a pathetic and familiar litany of prejudice and economic nihilism.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0702">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 637</span>
In contrast to the Government, we believe that it is an appropriate use of our power to make laws to encourage the establishment of minimum wage rates. If we do that, we express our belief that the labour market is not a free market for labour. In the real world outside the House, employees often have very little choice about their terms and conditions of employment, to which they agree. There is no free market for labour. That is a figment of Conservative imagination. Most people, whose only asset is their skill and labour, have no choice about their terms and conditions of employment. A few people who work in the City might command their salaries and be able to negotiate individually with their employers. That is not the reality for shopworkers or those who work in the toy industry or other industries covered by wages councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that that choice is rendered even less meaningful during periods of high unemployment—for example, if 4 million people were unemployed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I agree with my hon. Friend. The labour market that the Minsiter wants us to believe exists does not exist. That is why the wages councils are so important. By establishing minimum wages, we in this House in previous years have made it clear that it is a proper discharge of our function and our responsibility as lawmakers to recognise that working people in general need the protection and benefit of minimum wages. Otherwise, they will be exploited by employers who always have the upper hand in the labour market and can dictate terms and conditions of employment. One of the original objectives of the wages councils was to make good the deficiency in collective bargaining in some industries. Without the benefit of the wages councils, there is no doubt that workers would have been exploited by employers who commanded, and still command, the upper hand.<br><br>
The Minister said that the contract of employment is important and central to the Government's case and that the terms and conditions of employment are always the result of free negotiation between employers and employees. I wish that that were the case, but it is not. It is rare for a contract of employment to be truthfully described as an agreement. It is not. The contract of employment is a command disguised as an agreement. An essential ingredient in the command is the stipulation that the employers will fix the rate of pay. It is important for us to make it clear that, for some workers, wages councils are an important aspect of their employment. They give those workers the opportunity to sell their labour for a decent and proper wage. That is why I am a strong supporter of wages councils. They are central and imperative in the present labour market, if exploitation and abuse are to be avoided.<br><br>
We have heard much today about the lacklustre way in which the Government have set about enforcing the terms of wages council resolutions. We have had an extensive discussion about the inadequacies of the Government's policy, and I do not want to cover that ground again. I accept what the Minster said about the Government's policy on prosecutions. But if hon. Members were to examine the falling number of wages council inspectors who are employed, the hidden agenda would be revealed.<br><br>
The abolition of the Wages councils says something fundamental about the Government's economic agenda. It is an absurd priority for the Government to pursue at a time
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 638</span>
of rocketing unemployment, collapsing investment and profound unease about the state of the economy. That is particularly relevant in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham) who mentioned the collapse of employment in the shipbuilding industry. There can hardly be another shipbuilding community that has suffered so many job losses in such a short time, with the exception, perhaps, of the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey.<br><br>
The wages councils are important in practice because they guarantee minimum rights in the workplace. They are also important because they represent the value, worth and dignity of employees. Without the wages councils, we are convinced that the terms and conditions of working people will deteriorate. What other purpose could there be behind the Government's commitment to abolish the wages councils, if they do not expect wages to fall dramatically in those industries? There is no point abolishing the councils unless that is the Government's intention.<br><br>
This is an important debate for Opposition Members, not only in practical terms but in historical terms. It marks the end of the consensus between both sides of the House about the need for minimum employment protection rights. It is a statutory floor below which we, as a party, are not prepared to see working people fall and be forced to sell their labour. That is the reality.<br><br>
The Minister asked about the view we would take if an employer were to say to an employee, "I can employ you at a certain rate of pay, but it is less than the wages council rate." We should not be in the House if we were prepared to condone and tolerate that sort of exploitation. That does not represent a genuine agreement or a real meeting of minds. Any lawyer would confirm that that is what a contract is supposed to be: a free and consensual meeting of minds about the terms of the bargain.<br><br>
The Minister described conditions in which an employee is effectively told to work for an impossibly low wage or to have no job at all. That is a disgraceful abdication of our responsibility as lawmakers to influence and intervene in a market which is manifestly rigged against employees. There are cases in which the Government are prepared to rig the market. There are signs that that is happening in the coal industry—I do not wish to talk at length about that as it would be out of order.<br><br>
There is a willingness by all hon. Members to recognise, on occasion, that we have a responsibility as lawmakers to involve ourselves in a market that is clearly not working in the national interest. Therefore, why cannot we recognise that the argument that the market leads to exploitation is legitimate and that we cannot sit on our hands and say that we are prepared to tolerate that? That is grossly unreasonable and represents a blinkered view of our responsibility as lawmakers.<br><br>
In common with many of my hon. Friends, I believe passionately that the Government proposals are a substantial abdication of responsibility. That is characterised by examination of International Labour Organisation convention No. 26. Of the 99 signatories to the convention, only one has ever deratified. No one in the Committee will be awarded marks for discovering to whom that signature belongs: it is the British Government's. That marks the complete isolation of Britain from every nation in the world that has signed that convention. Britain is

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 639</span>
isolated both socially and economically by the absurd policies being pursued by the Government at a time of rapidly rising unemployment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak on the issue because I feel strongly about it, as do my hon. Friends. From time to time we try to avoid extremes of language and save them for other occasions, but it is inappropriate to avoid those extremes when discussing the clause and its principles. Most of my hon. Friends agree that there is nothing more obnoxious than those principles—they are evil and intended to introduce a system that will allow the maximum exploitation by the powerful and the privileged of the weakest in society. For all the nonsense wrapped around them, the playing around with statistics and the denial of the effects that abolishing wages council will have, those are the aims and intentions of the proposals.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Tiverton (Mrs. Browning) received representations supporting the abolition of wages councils, as I am sure other Conservative Members did. We did not. The representations to the hon. Lady were from hoteliers. I am sure that representations received by Conservative Members were from similar people—employers who would be able to lower the wages in their establishments were wages councils done away with. Those people have lobbied for the legislation so that they can further exploit their employees.<br><br>
As well as causing moral objections and anger, the abolition of wages councils makes no sense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If this is a moral issue, why was it not a moral issue when the Labour Government abolished the 11 wages councils? If the abolition of wages councils represents the creation of an evil, how can that be so when wages councils cover only 10 per cent. of the working population and when the remaining 90 per cent. have to negotiate their terms and conditions, free of statutory controls?</span></p>
<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the Minister's last question is that it is probably those 10 per cent. of people who most need protection. Ministers, Members of Parliament, managing directors of manufacturing companies and other people in better paid employment do not need that kind of protection. That is probably why wages council rates apply to 10 per cent. of the working population, not to the other 90 per cent.<br><br>
If the Minister would care to think back to his earlier remarks about the number of prosecutions that occurred under wages council legislation during the previous Labour Government, he might accept that that was because, at that time, unemployment never reached anything like 1 million; state benefit was far more generous then than it is now; trade unions were able to provide most working people with more protection then than now. Therefore, there was nothing like the appalling exploitation that there is now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste <span class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Gentleman confirm that the reason why the Labour Government got rid of so many wages councils was because they thought that those councils prevented people from joining unions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was—[<i>Interruption.</i>]</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 640</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Far too many remarks are being made from a sedentary position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that those wages councils were abolished by agreement. If the Opposition were interested only in supporting trade union organisations—as Conservative Members sometimes claim that we are—and were not interested in the well-being of working people, we should be more than happy in some respects to see wages councils abolished, because trade unions sprang from the sort of exploitation that the Government want to reintroduce.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spellar</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is difficult sometimes to recollect what happend earlier in the Committee's proceedings, but I have mentioned before that precisely that factor was behind the setting up of the trade boards and wages councils. That reason was expressed very well by Winston Churchill when he said that where there was—[<i>Laughter.</i>] It has obviously become unfashionable in the Conservative party to support Winston Churchill, but fashions come and go. Winston Churchill said that where there is no organisation and no parity of bargaining, one must find other means. The lack of balance in power at the workplace was the reason why those boards and wages councils were set up. There is no reason for the hilarity of Conservative Members unless, as I suspect is self-evident from the arguments that they have put forward, they do not understand the history of those councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that it was self-evident, in the present economic climate and from the way that the country has been run for the past few years, that imbalance in the workplace has grown tremendously and, with it, the need for such protection.<br><br>
I could not understand why the Minister acknowledged the evil of unemployment and yet refused to condemn low pay as evil. He challenged Opposition Members to consider whether it was acceptable for companies to make people unemployed because they could not pay them wages at wages council level. He flatly refused, however, and still does, to extend the argument and explain what is an acceptable wage. Is £1.85 an hour an acceptable wage? Is it better to put someone on the dole than to pay them that, or £1.50, £1.25 or nothing at all?<br><br>
We are discussing sectors of the economy that are not internationally tradeable and not subject to international competition. Conservative Members seem to be advocating that it is better to pay the most appallingly low wages, on which people could not possibly be expected to feed themselves, look after their families or cope with their responsibilities, than to put people on the dole. To pursue the logic of the Government's case to its end, I suspect that the hidden agenda is to get rid of social security provision, because that, too effectively distorts the employment market. Why grant people income support or unemployment benefit when they can be driven out to work for the wages that the hon. Member for Finchley said were paid in Bangladesh? The hon. Gentleman seemed to be holding that country up as a shining example. If we accepted his argument, we should have to ask why, as employers in Bangladesh can get away with paying such wages, Bangladesh is not a member of G7 and one of the most successful countries in the world? Is that the model to which we should aspire? Are we trying to introduce such employment circumstances here? The factory workers were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 641</span>
paid 1000 times in the back streets of London than they would have been in Bangladesh, but that was not enough. If we are discussing an internationally tradeable part of the economy, let us compete with Bangladesh. When we debated earlier clauses, Conservative Members were more than happy about the need for deregulation across the board, so let us compete on the same terms as that. Their argument is nonsense.<br><br>
I want to refer to the incidence of abuse and the derision that comes from Conservative Members when we talk about statistics and the work of the Low Pay Unit. Among the figures that were bandied about were statistics produced by the Low Pay Unit showing the number of establishments that were involved in paying illegal levels of wages. There was an argument about whether that was true, or whether those establishments did not have good records.<br><br>
I understand the anxiety of Conservative Members about burdens on small businesses. No one want to burden them unnecessarily. But are hon. Members arguing that an unreasonable burden would be placed on small businesses if those firms had to keep records of salaries? If it is not accepted that poor records are, in all probability, evidence of abuse, that implies that it is too much trouble for small businesses to keep records of the wages that are paid. If Conservative Members are really interested in tackling abuse, instead of employing people to chase those suspected of social security fraud, they should perhaps pinpoint what lies behind such fraud. They might find a correlation between the two issues and discover that employers are exploiting people through low wages by means of the black market and actively encouraging those frauds. That might explain why no adequate records of people's employment were kept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hanson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend refers to current breakages of the law which constitute criminal and not civil offences. If wages are being forced down and records and terms and conditions of employment are being exploited when that is a criminal offence, what will be the likely effects of the free for all that will result if the Bill is passed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have only to look outside the sectors of the economy currently covered by the wages councils to see what the effect of their abolition will be. One of the more notorious examples is the security industry. Advertisements for staff for that business regularly say, "Security man; £1.80 an hour; provide your own dog." Those are the sort of conditions offered by an industry which is not covered by wages council legislation.<br><br>
That is not only exploitation; it is not good sense. Who on earth would want someone who was being exploited for such wages to be made responsible for the security of his property? Given the privileged lives of all members of the Committee, what answers would we give if we were put in the position of such an employee and asked to feed the family and pay the rent out of such a salary? We have no need to expose the Minister's abuse of statistics. We are aware of what takes place in the deregulated parts of the economy, so we know what will happen if the wages councils are abolished.<br><br>
The security industry provides proof of the stupidity of the market. According to Conservative Members' dogma, the market is all-prevailing and must dictate what will happen from top to bottom in all instances. When we see the sort of security provided by companies that employ
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 642</span>
people on the terms and conditions that they are allowed to get away with under our legislative system, we know that the market is nonsense.<br><br>
We can see the economic stupidity of proposals which are supposed to save the taxpayer money. We are told that an awful burden of bureaucracy is imposed by the wages councils on the taxpayer and small businesses but I have heard no proof of that. I was not present this morning so I do not know whether any proof was offered, but the effects on the economy of the abolition of wages councils can be stated simply. In the short term, it will throw people on to the public sector borrowing requirement and add to the many problems that the Government now face. It will cut people's spending power and that will not benefit the economy.<br><br>
I often struggle to understand the claim that it makes sense and is good economics for those at the lower end of the wages ladder to make themselves economically viable and increase their prospects of employment by accepting low wages. However, we are also told that the only way in which those at the top of the wages structure can enhance the economy is to relieve them of any tax burden and ensure that they are given 200 per cent. increases in salaries and anything else which they feel they are entitled. But what do such economics do for the country? Those people do not spend their money on goods and products produced at home; they are more than happy to buy a foreign car or take a foreign holiday, unlike the people covered by wages councils legislation. Economically, it does not make sense. The trickle-down economics that are talked about in the United States have been brought here.</span></p>
<p>7.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Terry Rooney <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not repeat the many excellent arguments that have already been made. The crux of the Government's argument seems to be that what is needed is total deregulation of the labour market. They argue that that will create employment, but it will also drive down wages. They believe that there should be no statutory interference in the labour market and pay rates. However, the Government interfere in the wages market whenever it suits them, most notably through the Top Salaries Review Body and various other pay review bodies. I suspect that we shall not debate the abolition of those bodies for the time being.<br><br>
The Government have made much of the fact that in 1990 some of the wages councils ordered pay increases of more than 9 per cent., but that does not seem unreasonable when inflation was touching 11 per cent. and mortgage rates were in double figures. Where the Government determined pay, they saw fit to give 8 per cent. to teachers, 9.5 per cent. to nurses, 9.7 per cent. to the police and 10.4 per cent. to civil servants—not to mention those thieving, lazy swines known as Members of Parliament.<br><br>
I give one example of how the Government see fit to indulge heavily in the wage market when it suits their political ends. Between 1981 and 1992, police pay in Britain rose by 316 per cent. That obviously was not based on productivity, because burglaries and violent crime doubled. However, political incidents in the 1980s perhaps explain why Government interference was necessary. We have heard of the letter from Hilton International hotels. Anyone who knows anything about the hotel trade knows that a hotel's occupancy rate determines whether it breaks even, makes a profit or loses money hand over fist, not the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 643</span>
£2.50 an hour that it pays its cleaners, kitchen staff, bar staff or the myriad of other workers who ensure that it operates efficiently. It is odd that a hotel that charges more than £200 a night for a room finds a wage rate of £2.92 an hour entirely unacceptable. At the relevant time, Hilton International's occupancy rate was down from 78 per cent. to 53 per cent. due to a range of factors, not least the Gulf war. Nevertheless, profit margins are the responsibility of others, not necessarily low-paid workers.<br><br>
Ladbroke Group plc is a classic example of a company that has dubious employment practices, which will run wild if wages councils are abolished. Recently, Ladbrokes sent to every employee in its betting shops a letter and a new contract, which the employee had to sign and return within four weeks or face dismissal. The new contract changed the working week from 36 hours to 66 hours. It gave no day off during the six-day week, not time off for lunch, no overtime rates of pay and no guaranteed holidays, and all because a secret sweetheart deal was being done with the Home Secretary to open betting shops in the evening during the summer months.<br><br>
A 66-hour week, with no overtime payments, no guaranteed day off and no guaranteed lunchhour—that is from a supposedly respectable public company. It that is a respectable public company's way of conducting industrial relations, I fear for those employed by companies that everyone would agree are bad.<br><br>
It is a myth that low pay creates jobs. In west Yorkshire in general and Bradford in particular we know from bitter experience during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s what low pay does in the textile industry. The textile companies that survived, prospered and still employ people are those that invested in technology, machinery and training. Those that paid sweatshop wages and invested nothing have long gone and we are well rid of them.<br><br>
Conservative members of the Committee may have read an article in <i>The Independent</i> on Wednesday which reported that Tesco and Sainsbury had the novel idea of handing out family credit claim forms when interviewing people for jobs. Perhaps that is a good idea, as it saves time later. It would be interesting to know what the total bill has been since 1971 from the public purse for family income supplement and family credit, how that has distorted the labour market and why that subsidy is all right, but encouraging people to earn a living wage is not.<br><br>
There has been much comment especially from Ministers in the Department of Social Security, that people have calculated that they are better off on the dole than working and that those people are despicable. That situation has been created by wages of £1 an hour or less and we know who should be called despicable. The abolition of the wages councils will indeed lead to the creation of jobs—at citizens advice bureaux, debt counselling units and probably at the family credit centre in Blackpool and in the housing benefit calculation departments of local authorities. The debt and advice service industry will grow and unemployment will rocket.<br><br>
It is a constant source of wonder that Government Departments give such differing advice on what is an acceptable rate of pay. In my local Jobcentre, a person who refuses a job that pays £58 a week is deemed not to have availed himself of work. That is considered an acceptable wage and anyone who does not accept it does not get benefit. However, in a recent case involving the Home
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 644</span>
Office on an immigration matter, a person who was seeking entry to the United Kingdom had been offered a job that paid £100 a week net. He was told that that was insufficient to keep himself, his wife and two children, therefore he could not be admitted to the country.<br><br>
Those examples show that the Government's proposal is born out of malice and prejudice and its leading proponents seem to be those who have the largest cheques each year for Smith Square.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are wholly misconceived. They would require further debate, consultation or examination of wages councils after the Government have decided that they should be abolished. It is hard to imagine a less useful exercise and I have no hesitation in inviting the Committee to reject them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At risk of upsetting people who want to get away to dinner and who possibly, do not want to return, we do not think that the Minister's answer is satisfactory. He has not dealt with the points that have been made. As so many Conservative Members are supporters of Adam Smith, perhaps they could address themselves to some words from "Wealth of Nations" and apply them to the circumstances. That great revolutionary Scottish philosopher and economist would have been more than slightly at odds with modern Tories: Not only Winston Churchill would have found their views nauseating. Indeed, Adam Smith could have been describing the three biggest wages councils when he described all who work, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"they who feed, clothe and lodge the whole body of the people should have such share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed and lodged".</p></blockquote>
That is what Adam Smith said in 1776. That goes back well before Winston Churchill to someone who was morally superior to the present Tory party, even if he is one of its heroes.<br><br>
The Government have adduced no sound evidence to show that the abolition of wages councils will not result in the reduction of wages of some of the worst paid workers in the country. They have adduced not a shread of evidence to show that it will not widen the gender gap between men and women's pay. They have traduced the low pay units around the country, which, on limited funds, have attempted to find out the facts. That research is not a bland statistical exercise conducted by people who earn £30,000 or £40,000 a year for carrying out desk studies. The Minister described the Greater Manchester low pay unit as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Labour party. It is worth remembering that the Employment Market Research Unit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Department of Employment. Even in a document for which the public has paid, it produced—I do not know whether the statisticians are reponsible—wholly misleading summaries of the evidence contained therein. The summary says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nor is there evidence of systematic falls in the pay of young people relative to the pay of employees aged 21 years and over in the period following the Wages Act".</p></blockquote>
One need only look at the figures to which the report refers before that misleading summary was stuck on it to find that the pay of young men in full-time employment fell by 2.8 per cent. and that that of young women fell by 4.4 per cent. In the hotel and catering sector, the pay of young men fell by 4.6 per cent. and that of young women by 9.7 per cent. In retailing, pay fell by 1.1 per cent. for young

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 645</span>
males and 2.2 per cent. for young women. Those statistics are summarised in an official Government document, which I pay for, as,
<br><blockquote><p>"Nor is there evidence of systematic falls in the pay of young people",</p></blockquote>
That is totally misleading. We expect Ministers to mislead us; it is almost part of their task, but we do not expect public service to do it at our expense.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has strayed slightly out of order. We do not expect any hon. Member to mislead anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that you maintain a certain idealism in the Chair, Mr. Knox, and we must bow to that.<br><br>
The Government are trying to abolish wages councils and they have not seriously considered the consequences of that. They have produced documents for their members of which one refers to "independent opinion". Who gave the independent opinion? It was given by the British Hotels Restaurants and Caterers Association and Grand Metropolitan Plc.<br><br>
The Government's theory is that a person who is trying to get a job could bargain on equal terms for decent pay and would need no help from Parliament, Government or statute. What equality of bargaining power is there for the person on the edge of my constituency who lies in a cardboard box all night, who goes to the jobs office which deals with the catering industry and who tries to get a decent rate of pay out of Grand Metropolitan, which last year made £960 million in profit?<br><br>
There is no bargaining in such a circumstance. There is an enforced decision by the rich and powerful owners against which one human being has no redress and no argument. It is preposterous for the Government to suggest that there would be some equality in bargaining between the employee and the employer in the circumstances that any sentient soul could envisage if the wages council were abolished.<br><br>
7.30 pm<br><br>
The Government's proposal is objectionable. They have not addressed themselves to any of the criticisms. The Minister referred to the left-wing opponents of the policy. That opposition apparently includes the official Equal Opportunities Commission whose chair, Joanna Foster, was appointed by Mrs. Thatcher who, as we all know, appointed people who she described as, "one of our sort". Joanna Foster was a Tory business woman who saw the light when she arrived at the EOC. It it not a left-wing organisation but a body charged by Parliament to discharge its duties to secure equal opportunities for women. It observed that wages councils had narrowed the gender pay gap and that the abolition of the influence of wages councils on the employment of young people had widended the gender pay gap.<br><br>
The Equal Opportunities Commission believes that what the Government are doing is wrong. That has to do not with left or right but with common sense. The Government are not talking common sense but are subscribing to crackpot variants on old economic theories that never worked. Their ideas are based on Britain in the 19th century. I wish to God that Britain today, under this Government, was as competitive as it was in the 19th century. They have not even got that right.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 646</span>
The legislaiton that the Government are trying to change marked a recognition that the market does not always work. Sometimes it works well, sometimes it works badly and sometimes it does not work at all. In the case of the pay or the worse off, it never works. There is no bottom limit. The equilibriam point could be nought. The Minister confirmed that he accepts that the equilibrium point could be nought. Nigel Lawson, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, went to the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund and talked not about a high-tech society or a low-tech society but a "no-tech economy." That is now going to be matched with a no-pay ecomony, if owners and employees can drive wages down. We know that they would be able to do that. It is totally unacceptable.<br><br>
The Government have produced not a shred of evidence to suggest that their proposal would create jobs. They advocate what is said in the Beenstock and Warburton study, which found that
<br><blockquote><p>"a 1 per cent. increase in real wages reduces employment by around 1 per cent."</p></blockquote>
It is a damn good job that it does not, or no country would try to raise its real living standards because it would follow that those standards could not be raised without throwing more and more people out of work. That is not the experience of the world in general.<br><br>
To return to the point I made in opening the debate: all over the world, throughout history, high wages have gone with prosperity and low wages with poverty. We need to work to eliminate poverty. We believe that the maintenance of wages councils sustains to some extent the living standards of those covered by them and that is why we believe that they should continue.</span></p>
