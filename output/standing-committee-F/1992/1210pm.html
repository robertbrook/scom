	<div class='title'>RIGHT NOT TO SUFFER DEDUCTION OF UNAUTHORISED OR EXCESSIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 38, in page 26, line 17, after "time", insert "renew or".—[	<i>Mr. Dobson.</i>]</p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I will oppose the amendment. It is meaningless and serves no practical purpose. As no right to pay trade union subscriptions through the check-off exists, it is a nonsense to remind people of a right to renew their consent. The amendment would have no practical effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's proposal, like all their brilliant efforts, is intended only to cause trouble for trade unions. We believe that the insertion of the words, "or renew" offers some benefit to unions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I should inform the hon. Gentleman that the words are "renew or", not "or renew".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be easier if the amendment were properly printed on the amendment paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said earlier, if the Government think it reasonable to remind a trade union member of his right to withdraw from the scheme, they should also remind him of his right to renew. Otherwise, there will be a ratchet in the system. That is the litmus test. If the Government are concerned about individuals making choices, there is no reason why the employer's notification should remind employees of their right to withdraw, but not of their right to renew. Both rights will have equal status in law, even if the clause is agreed to. It would be unreasonable to confine notification to the right to withdraw. Furthermore, there has been no suggestion that rules will be laid down to govern how notification of the right to withdraw will be given. It could be worded in such a way that people will be encouraged to withdraw, or threatened in such a way as to suggest that withdrawal would be a good idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not accept the amendment, it will show that the purpose of the clause has nothing to do with individual choice, but everything to do with fouling up the finances of trade unions—a further stage that the Secretary of State could not bring herself to announce in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>170</span>
the House, but distributed by parliamentary answer. That is all part and parcel of what we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are faced with a party in Government who received secret funds from Greek fascists, but are doing their best to ensure that the Labour party does not receive funds. The principal supplier of funds for the Labour party—the trade unions—will find it increasingly difficult both to provide finance for a political fund and to carry out their normal duties, which are accepted in the European Community and have hitherto been accepted in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might interest members of the Committee to know that, in relation to the rights of trade unionists and of trade unions—the two cannot be separated—in every other country in Europe and within the European Community institutions it is pretty automatic for trade unions to be valued, encouraged and consulted. As good an indication of that as any—I discovered this information through a parliamentary answer—is that the TUC general secretary has met the Secretary of State once in his British capacity, but—if I read the answer correctly—four or five times in his European role on the European TUC and the other European institutions that are part of the consultation process in the European Community
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is to be a trade union law with any pretensions to fairness, when somebody is reminded of their right to withdraw he should, at the very least, be reminded of his right to renew. Much will hang on the Government's response to the amendment. If they do not respond favourably, I think that we can assume that we are faced with a deliberate wrecking clause—and we are often accused of tabling wrecking amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has nothing to do with the rights of individuals, with the sensible conduct of trade unions or with the efficient conduct of business in Britain. It has everything to do with the Government, who are more petty-minded than their predecessor, and with the present incumbent in Downing Street who is infinitely more petty-minded than his predecessor. He is doing his best to damage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the terms of the amendment are somewhat narrow. I have been tolerant because I realise that he is in a difficult position, but he is going rather wide of the mark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman does not have to say anything. If the Chair makes a ruling, that is that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me put it this way—I have to speak if I am to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman needs to speak only if he is in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always do my desperate best to remain in order and defer, as ever, to the rulings of the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister who is now in Edinburgh said that the clause was introduced in an effort to help individual trade unionists. We have been doubtful of that; we think that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0443">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
it is a spiteful and vindictive measure. The relevance of what I am saying is that it is more spiteful and vindictive than any of the trade union laws that were introduced under the Prime Minister's predecessor. That seems to me to be a wholly reasonable point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government can easily disprove my accusation that they are being spiteful by accepting the amendment. There would then be an air of verisimilitude to their claim that they are being even-handed and are interested in informing trade union members of their rights. Perhaps the Minister will agree that, at least in principle, it is a good amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not convinced by what the hon. Gentleman said. Everything that he says assumes that people, if given free choice, will say no. I do not believe that that is necessarily the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the hon. Gentleman's point about Government meetings with the general secretary of the TUC, my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State has agreed to a meeting with Mr. Willis whenever he has requested it. Thanks to her, he was invited to the informal Council meeting that was held under the United Kingdom's presidency. The hon. Gentleman's criticism of my right honourable Friend is without foundation and without fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is meaningless and serves no practical purpose. As no right to a trade union subscription through the check-off exists, it is nonsense to remind people of a right to renew their consent. The amendment would have no practical effect. For that reason, I do not believe that it is worth adding to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rationale consistently put forward by Conservative Members for not just the Bill but its clauses, is that, dressed up, it deals with the rights of trade union members. Today they appear to be saying that they cannot understand an amendment that gives the individual's right to renew membership the same status as the individual's right to withdraw from the trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) said, this part of the clause is not about informing union members of their rights but is about encouraging them to withdraw from their unions. If that is not its purpose, why cannot people be informed of their right to renew at the same time as they are informed of their right to withdraw? The purpose of the clause must be to encourage people to leave trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition members of the Committe have suspected that motive as we have proceeded with the provisions. From our discussions over the past couple of weeks we were beginning to think that perhaps constructive dialogue was going on. Any such notions that I may have had were given a shock this afternoon when I learned from a written answer that, having imposed new obligations on unions concerning balloting, the Government intend to scrap assistance with ballots, without having the courage to come to the Committee or to the House. They also intend to scrap assistance with trade union training. Why? One has only to read the letter from the Minister to find out that it is because the number of strikes have gone down and trade unionists need training only if the level of strikes is high, so that strikes can be avoided. There is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>172</span>
no sense in that reply of the trade union's role of representing its members. It is not acknowledged that the majority of work performed by trade unions has nothing to do with strikes nor with industrial action, but ensures that individual rights of individual members are observed and that members have decent conditions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I find that very hard to relate to the amendment. Perhaps the hon. Member will want to contribute to the clause stand part debate, but for now perhaps he will relate his remarks to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason I raised those issues in relation to the amendment is that they seem to go to the heart of the matter. The amendment aims to ensure that the Government acknowledge that the practical right to be a member of and active in a trade union is given equal status in law to the right that the Government want to introduce, the right to withdraw from the union. It seems to me that their opposition to the amendment is linked to today's decision about trade union ballots and trade union training.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respect what you say, Mr. Knox, and I might return to the matter when we debate clause stand part. If the Government want to retain any credibility on the issue of individual rights, they must agree to the amendment. Otherwise, Opposition Members' fears, which were given further ground this afternoon, would be confirmed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had a fairly extensive debate on some of the issues raised by clause 12 when we debated the amendments. We made no progress in persuading Conservative Members about the fairness of our argument. When the Committee adjourned, a letter arrived that confirmed many of my opinions about trade union legislation introduced by Conservative Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By discussing clause 12 and previous clauses, we have been trying to engage Conservative Members in a debate about the practical effects of this detailed legislation, which is, after all, about a voluntary organisation freely joined in what is supposed to be a democracy. The clause deals with how membership money should be collected. The agreement between a trade union and a member is voluntary and that member knows about it when he joins. The employer approves of the agreement and helps to administer it. I strongly believe that the law has little role in regulating such private agreements unless fraud or some other criminal offence is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Criminal offences or fraud—in this case, taking money from people's wages without permission—are covered by existing law. One of our main contentions this morning was that no practical purpose would be served by creating another body of law that would interfere, in a minuscule and prescriptive way, in issues over which the law should have no effective right. If a law is to be respected in a democratic society, it has to be seen to be fair and, in my view, it must apply equally across different groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>173</span>
A body of law was brought together in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which, in very small detail, purports to organise, restrict, prescribe and limit the relations between employees and their trade unions, and employers and the trade unions that represent their work force. If there was that amount of lawful interference in other private voluntary organised clubs—for example, the Carlton club, the RAC, the MCC or other bizarre organisations to which some people belong—perhaps I would be willing to listen. Will the Minister enlighten me on whether the Department of Employment, when drawing up the Green Paper, did its best to find a way of abolishing direct debit union contributions? From what I have been told by people in the Department, it seems that it tried but was unable to do so in a way that was acceptable even to the barefaced cheek of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was much discussion this morning of being fair and giving rights to trade union members, paradoxically by interfering with agreements that they make of their own accord with organisations that they join. We are using the law to interfere with those rights. Before the Minister jetted off to Edinburgh to what he presumably thinks are more important matters, I asked him to explain the difference between a check-off arrangement with a works social club and a similar arrangement for trade union membership. He did not give a satisfactory answer or even a justification that would stand up to five minutes of objective assessment. The question remains to be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of Parliament are legislators and we have a view on how citizens should behave, so we should ensure that the law is even-handed. It is clear, despite all the rhetoric about individual freedom, that the provision is not even-handed. It applies in a discriminatory way to one organisation for the simple reason that Conservative Members do not like trade unions and their links with the Labour party. The Government want to suppress trade unions and are behaving disgracefully and undemocratically, which is unjustifiable in a modern democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter that we received today shows that the Conservative party is not interested in free and fair trade unionism or democracy of any sort. The Conservative party has been a well-known opponent of democracy when that suited it. The Government are treating trade unionists, individually and collectively, as the enemy within. They talk about individual trade union rights and then ban trade union membership at GCHQ, saying that trade union membership is incompatible with patriotism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind Conservative Members that some trade union members are Conservatives and the Conservative trade unionist group did not like the provision any more than other trade unionists. Full-time trade union organisers look after their members regardless of political affiliations. Their job of representation is similar to that of legislators in the House when looking after their constituents' interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision, with all its deliberate complexity, harasses one section of society which has as much right as any other organisation to make its own internal rule book without the vindictive interference of the Bill. The Conservative party has its own vested interests. It raises funds from Greek fascists, Hong Kong business men, presumably gun runners, arms dealers, and anyone else it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
can get money from. During the Committee's debates on clause 12 and on other clauses, the Opposition have had to listen to the honesty and integrity of trade unionists and their officials being impugned. Somehow trade unions are not to be trusted to deal with their membership. The law has to decide whether unions can accept individuals as members. There is a constant drip, drip, drip suggestion that trade union members or officials are incipient criminals who cannot be trusted and who must have their working lives and union roles prescribed by law. Such views should not exist in a democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 12 interferes in an agreement freely entered into by members. Not just unions but other sections of society have such agreements. We pay gas bills and utility bills. The Government advised people that direct debit was an easy and quick way to pay the poll tax. I agree with my colleague who said that there is little difference between direct debit and check-off. They are the same type of arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The primary purpose of the clause is to cause instability and unpredictability in trade unions' cash flow. The secondary purpose is to destabilise political moneys, held by trade unions after lawful ballots, that may or may not be given to the Labour party. That is the hidden agenda behind the cant and hypocrisy that we heard this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will impose as much red tape as possible on trade unions. It will ensure that, in law, it will be assumed that trade union officials, administrators and head offices of trade unions are up to no good and need to be constantly watched and harassed. The Government use the dubious and fatuous argument that there ought to be individual trade union rights. If the Conservative party were interested in such rights, the Government would have introduced much stronger employment rights for individuals in the Bill. The Government have been forced by the EC, kicking and screaming, to include the weak improvements in employment rights in the latter part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's arguments are hypocritical. From the written answer that we received this afternoon, we know that the Government will justify the legislation by saying that public money will be provided to assist in the organisation of the onerous administrative duties. The Government impose such duties on free organisations, insisting that those organisations have constantly to rewrite their rule books. A few years later, provisions are abolished and the burden is increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Administrative plans are being introduced by clause 12 which represent a direct threat to trade unions' membership and the flow of finances that is needed to organise their industrial relations activities in factories and other workplaces. There is also the provision to take money granted in earlier Bills, using the hypocritical argument that it is in the interest of the public and democracy for the ballot to be properly funded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals for check-off have nothing to do with ensuring that individuals do not have deductions made from their wages without their say-so. We have established that that right already exists in law. Trade unions will have to spend a great deal of time, money and effort to comply with the changes to check-off with the result that they will be running round in increasingly diminishing circles to comply with that legislative harassment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>175</span>
Millions of pounds are spent on ballots. The letter to which I referred will cost trade unions millions of pounds. At the same time, clause 12 threatens to take away their financial stability. Hon. Members must consider both sides of the argument so that they appreciate the Government's tactics. The Government should be warned that, if they bring the law into disrepute by passing one-sided legislation that harasses people, it will rebound on them. People will not respect laws that are so partisan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spent much time talking about how awful it is to deduct money from wages without permission, with which I agree. However, there are other examples of mistaken deductions. Banks do it all the time when they get direct debits wrong. The Inland Revenue does it through the PAYE system and, usually, rectifies its mistakes during the following year. The situation of newly elected Members of Parliament who have received their first tax assessment is entirely the opposite; the Inland Revenue then claims vast amounts back. Such things happen. Why is it considered perfectly reasonable for the Inland Revenue to make such mistakes, yet, if a trade union or employer accidently deducts a few pounds from someone's pay-packet, that is considered to be an offence so heinous that clause 12 and all the might of the law must be invoked to put a stop to it? That is difficult to explain unless we understand the Government's hidden agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard many lectures. I recall past debates—Government attempts to justify previous legislation—in which the Government told us that trade unions must be brought into the modern world and not live in the past. Why, therefore, do the Government intend to throw them back into the stone age by telling tem that they must collect membership subscriptions by hand when computerised systems are available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mclaughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady tell me where it says that check-off cannot take place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly tell the Minister why I make that assertion. Even the Government would not be so crass as to attempt to abolish check-off, although they did float that idea in the Green Paper, during the softening-up process. It is the usual salami tactic. They will not abolish it; they will just make it practically impossible because the administrative cost of the new system will be horrendous. The Government want to create such a complicated system that no employer in his right mind will implement it. The hidden agenda of clause 12 is to encourage employers to abolish check-off. The Government will not abolish check-off in law because they cannot justify it, but the clause has the same effect. That is why it should be opposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

wages are made, there are many technical deficiencies in the clause. The Government's reluctance to concede some of our improvements to the clause suggests that it has another purpose, which is why we cannot support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My personal objections to the clause can be summarised on two levels. I have several substantial technical objections to the way in which the clause has been constructed. I shall explain them in a moment. Additionally, there is a more substantial layer of opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to comprehend why, if the Government's objective is to facilitate an improvement in the individual rights of trade union members, the burden of the main bureaucratic machinery that is designed to secure that result appears to be placed on the employer. I have benefited from reading a characteristically colourful press notice from the Department of Employment, which featured several juicy quotations from the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Stirling (Mr. Forsyth). I read the press release and deduced that it was a characteristic piece of Euro-scepticism on the hon. Gentleman's part. I do not want to detain the Committee by quoting all those remarks, because. I am sure that you, Mr. Knox, would be on your feet telling me that I was out of order. I shall confine my quotations to those parts of the press notice, which is dated 6 November, which I believe throw light on the Government's true intentions and purpose behind the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The press notice is headlined:
	<br><q><p>"Over-regulation stifles creativity and initiative says Minister of State for Employment Michael Forsyth".</p></q>
It begins:
	<br><q><p>"Too much regulation protects the inefficient, stifles creativity and initiative and prevents growth said the Minister of State".</p></q>
He goes on:
	<br><q><p>" 'What we can do is to minimise controls by simplifying the procedures, and to repeal those regulations that are outmoded or ineffective'".</p></q>
I agree with a further comment, but it makes the Government's support for the clause more obscure:
	<br><q><p>" 'We intend to make more progress towards cutting unnecessary burdens, whether imposed by local authorities' "</p></q>
or "'central government'".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause imposes unnecessary additional bureaucratic machinery on employers. Labour Members are entitled to ask how the Government can support the ambition, clearly articulated by the Minister, to reduce administrative burdens and cut through the red tape that he regards as strangling industry, and support the creation of a new tier of largely unnecessary bureaucratic machinery to impose on employers when it comes to the operation of the check-off system. We find that difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also be clear about why the Government might be proposing such a clause. Have employers sought the clause? Have the Government received any representations from industry supporting the clause? Are they able to tell the Committee that the clause has the widespread endorsement of British industry? I rather doubt it
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, we are fortunate that, although we have sustained many redundancies during the past two years, we have some of the biggest British companies

operating there, the largest of which is Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend is wrong about that. If the shipyard were to close, it would be devastating for my constituency. It employs 8,000 people, the vast majority of whom are trade union members, and most of those are moderate trade unionists. Trade union leadership in the yard has been good over the past couple of years. The best part of those trade union members have their subscriptions paid under the check-off system. In 1990s Britain, such companies are few and far between. There are probably only a few industrial single-employer sites that employ that number. I am proud that one of them operates successfully in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to envisage what it would be like for the personnel department of Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd. to go through the process outlined in new subsection (4). It would have to send out individual notices on the three-year cycle to each of those 8,000 members inviting them to reconsider the trade union check-off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have technical objections to new subsection (4) because it is badly drafted. Some of its provisions will give employers technical problems—not only administrative, but legal. What will happen when employers make mistakes? The clause allows the employee to take the employer to an industrial tribunal to try to recover the amount that should not have been deducted. But the clause is unclear and there is the possibility that those employers will face criminal liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are unfair in their attempts to create the impression that they are cutting through red tape by encouraging a new enterprise culture for business to operate on a commercial level, while creating this ludicrous and unnecessary bureaucracy. The objection on technical grounds is substantive and one which Opposition Members intend to pursue. It is impossible to accept the Government's case that this is simply a clause to promote individual employment rights, because there are many other ways in which that could be done. It will not help employers. A substantial administrative and bureaucratic burden will be imposed on VSEL.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the reason for the bureaucratic interventions and legal requirements is to encourage employers to say, "Forget the whole thing," and have nothing to do with check-off? If possible, they might even de-recognise the unions because it is too much of a bother.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend always makes valid contributions to the debate. It is difficult to answer that because the Government's intentions are carefully concealed. I suspect that that would be one of the likely consequences—whether the Government intend it or not. It would be an unfortunate development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Underlying the clause is something of the old-style hostility to collective bargaining that we saw from the Conservatives in the 1980s. It is wrong for Conservative Members to assume, as they often do, that collective bargaining is wrong. For millions of workers, it is the only effective way in which they can conduct industrial
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
relations with their employer. Some fortunate people in industry may be able to negotiate individually with their employers and good luck to them. No Opposition Member would object to that. But for the vast majority of employees, collective bargaining is the only effective way in which they can make their views known to their employers, obtain justice in the workplace and negotiate terms and conditions. It will be depressing if it emerges from the debate that the Government are still pursuing their old-fashioned vendetta against trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In industrial relations in general, we need to find a way to harmonise and balance the interests of employers and employees. Collective bargaining is the traditional method of doing that. Clause 12 overtly represents the outdated mode of thought according to which the Government attack collective bargaining, which would be counter-productive to achieving good industrial relations in Britain in the 1990s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey was right to suggest that clause 12 would undermine the operation of the check-off arrangements at a national level, it would fundamentally weaken collective bargaining. The Government will rue the day if that happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about the golden thread of logic that runs through the Government's argument in favour of clause 12. Opposition Members will find that difficult to detect if they examine the detailed wording of the clause. New subsection (3)(a) imposes a mandatory three-year renewal arrangement. We have debated the merits or otherwise of the three-year rule. The clause includes adequate safeguards, which the Opposition support, to guarantee the rights of individual trade union members in relation to check-off arrangements, and, in particular, the right to withdraw, which, as the clause clearly states, is an available option. The clause provides also for the right to receive written notice of an increase in subscription.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause includes sufficient protection to render new subsection (3)(a) otiose. If new subsection (3)(a) is otiose, why is it included? It does not materially or substantially benefit trade union members. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey suggested, it is further evidence of a different purpose. We could argue about what those hidden objectives and ambitions might be—the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) gave the Government's game away when he moved his amendment—but the Government are clearly pursuing another agenda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Leaving aside my objections of principle, I should like to ask the Minister two specific questions. I find the words, "appropriate notice" in new subsection (5) problematic. I do not want to detain the Committee for long, but it may help to explain my concern if I read out the definition of "appropriate notice" in new subsection (5). "Appropriate notice" means notice in writing stating
	<br><q><p>"the amount of the increase and the increased amount of the subscription deductions".</p></q>
I am sure that hon. Members are aware that the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 gives employees the right to receive an itemised pay statement Is the right to an itemised pay statement under the 1978 Act wide enough to include the definition of "appropriate
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0447">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
notice" in new subsection (5)? If the concept of an itemised pay statement is broad enough, it is difficult to see what new subsection (5) adds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion of an itemised pay statement is clear. If there is a deduction for trade union contributions, the itemised pay statement will spell out to which trade union the money has been paid and how much has been paid. Does not that fall within the concept of "appropriate notice"? It is probable that that point has not been brought to the Government's attention. That is an injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another concern about a technical aspect of the clause. The Minister talked this morning about the application of the Wages Act 1986 to check-off. The Secretary of State also spoke in the House about that application. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras spoke for most Opposition members of the Committee when he said that the provision is unnecessary because the Wages Act 1986 provides sufficient protection already. Why is the further authorisation in clause 12 needed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers say that there is a problem about collective agreements. As legal documents, collective agreements are significant only to the extent that they are incorporated in individual contracts of employment. Some collective agreements may specify trade union collection rates, subscriptions and check-off arrangements. By such a process, the collective agreement might form part of an individual contract of employment. My understanding of the Government's case is that, if that happens, the conditions of the 1986 Act are already satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends and I do not interpret the 1986 Act in that way. I know of no case law that supports the Government's argument that it is a sufficient act of individual authorisation for a collective agreement to contain an express reference to a check-off arrangement. I do not think that the 1986 Act interprets that as an act of individual authorisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another query that I have about the 1986 Act concerns the clause's detailed wording. From the clause it is not clear to me that failure to comply with its new obligations is a breach of section 1(1) of the 1986 Act. Section 68(4) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 makes it clear that a failure to comply with that section is a breach of section 1(1) of the 1986 Act and is, therefore, a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see an equivalent wording in clause 12 that incorporates the provisions of section 68(4). Section 68(4) disappears from clause 12. Therefore, it is not immediately apparent that a breach of clause 12 would involve the commission by the employer of a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only reference that I can find to the 1986 Act in clause 12 is in new clause 68A, which refers to section 1(1) of the Act. That reference, however, does not specify that non-compliance with clause 12 will be a criminal offence. It refers to section 1(1) only in the context of a definition of certain contraventions, but it does not spell it out that failure to comply with clause 12 is in contravention of the 1986 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition strongly support the employment rights of individuals, as our record shows. Clause 12, however, is so technically deficient that it does not deserve our support. It is apparent from the clause and from
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
some of the contributions of Conservative members of the Committee, that the clause is not about the protection and advancement of individual employment rights but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey said, about undermining the operation of the check-off system. It reflects, I am afraid to say, continuing hostility to collective bargaining as a means of conducting industrial relations. That is reprehensible, will not promote industrial relations and does not deserve the Committee's support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have debated some amendments on the clause, but it is as unsatisfactory at the end of the process as it was at the beginning. Therefore, unusually, we want to divide on clause stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claimed that they wanted to suppress certain wrongs that had been committed, but they cannot come up with any proven example. Quoting what even 	<i>The Sun</i> referred to as an allegation is not yet proof in law in this country, although the way matters are going, I can imagine that it might become that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Long before it decided to establish the Labour party, the labour movement was dedicated to the idea that employers should not lay hands on any of an employee's money, and take it away and use it without the consent of each worker. If the present law is inadequate, it is a Tory law and a Tory Wages Act that are inadequate. If the law is inadequate and there are occasions when, other than by accident, employers are deducting trade union subscriptions—or what purport to be trade union subscriptions—from employees' pay, without then-consent, we should be prepared to go along with, and even suggest, changes to the law. There is no evidence that that is happening and the odd incidents to which Ministers have drawn attention are plainly contrary to the existing law—they should have resulted in prosecutions of the employers. If that has not been the case, that is the fault of the Department of Employment and of the Ministers responsible for running it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I know, Ministers cannot come up with a single prosecution. They did not pay sufficient attention until they were cobbling together a Green Paper of obnoxious proposals for the trade unions. They have come up with no examples of people who were known to be breaking the law and whom they have prosecuted under the laws mat they passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About three quarters of trade union subscriptions are obtained through check-off, a process which has developed over a long time and which suits the employer, the employee and the trade union. The process is convenient and commonplace throughout western Europe, with the exception of France, which is a little freaky for reasons that I explained this morning. The Government want to make a legal right in Italy and Spain unlawful in Britain. That is how far we are from the general opinion in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that there should be no concept of check-off without consent. We believe mat members must be notified of increases. We are prepared to accept mat members can withdraw, but only if they are reminded at the same time, even-handedly, by law, that they can renew—that has just been rejected. We also believe that, if it is not clear in law, although we think that it is, if someone wishes to remain a member of the union but to withdraw from the check-off arrangement, he should be legally entitled so to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0448">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
Trade union members, in common with everybody else, should be allowed to pay subscriptions to the organisation of which they are voluntarily a member, by whatever means suits them. That is freedom of choice. If they want Alf to come and collect the subscriptions, that should be allowed. If they want to pay by check-off, banker's order, direct debit or in any other way, they should be able to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State, the hon. Member for Stirling, did not reply to the hon. Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills), who asked why a trade unionist should not be able to make an open-ended commitment to have his subscription checked off. The hon. Gentleman also asked the Minister why the provision should limit the arrangement with time thresholds and what is unique about trade union subscriptions. It has become clear today that the Government do not like trade union subscriptions because they are necessary to the effective functioning of trade unions and the Government do not believe in a plural society. Employers have a collective arrangement, which is uniquely protected by law, by which people can invest without risking all their funds—limited liability. Most employees are faced with the state and large organisations which are protected by limited liability. Those corporations may be very large and their bosses may be in Britain, outer Mongola or the United States. It is not fair and even-handed to expect people to negotiate on their own behalf with those giant corporations. The Government want individual contracts for everyone and everyone to have their own little bit of space in the world. That has never been fair and cannot be fair now, as is recognised throughout western Europe. That is why trade unions in every country in western Europe are better protected in law than in Britain. The provision is just another step in the Government's efforts to ensure that the position of people at work and those who would like to be at work in this country is weaker than ever before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for a commencement arrangement as laid down in schedule 8, nor should there be special renewal procedures for payroll deduction of trade union subscriptions when such procedures do not apply to other payroll deductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members do not listen to the employers' organisations, other than the Institute of Directors. Check-off is cheap and convenient for employers, trade unions and employees. The other merit for the employer is that the system saves time. In most organisations, other than those in which people with submachine-guns preside, Alf goes round collecting subscriptions. Employers prefer Alf to be working instead of collecting subscriptions and talking to people who should also be working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government claim that a result of their trade union legislation has been a reduction in the number of industrial disputes. Some people within the trade union movement, who were opposed to the introduction of check-off, believe that one reason for that reduction is that people no longer go round collecting subscriptions and, at the same time, agitating. The work force is more quiescent as a result of the check-off arrangement. That is the belief of some employers and more extreme
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
elements on the industrial scene. Sensible and forward-looking employers favour check-off because they do not like the alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State made no effort this morning to discuss the complexities of applying the law that will fall on employers, together with the costs. Ignatius Loyola himself could not have provided a better Jesuit justification for let-out than the Minister when asked whether the Government had made any assessment of the likely cost for employers. The Government will not impose the cost; it will be imposed because of the arrangement into which employers enter. The cost is not a bit of theory dreamt up by someone; it will be real. Payrolls will become more complex; industrial relations will become more complex; and there will be more scope for argument because of misunderstanding. That is all part of the Government's policy to chip away at the position of trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are now producing brochures for well-paid civil servants, posing as members of the Foreign Office, to give to people around the world inviting them to invest in Britain where the work force is weaker than in Germany, France or Spain. What a way to encourage investment—civil servants saying that their fellow citizens are in a weaker position to resist than others in Europe as they will be if those objectional practices are introduced into our industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government hope that with high unemployment and what is happening in the mining industry, parts of the printing industry and trade union law, they will provoke an outbreak of industrial action to divert attention from the deplorable state of the economy. It is not beyound belief that that is the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to all that the Government say about problems with industrial relations and days lost, we should remember that in one year under the Conservative Government 24 million days were lost through strikes, mainly the miners' strike. Twenty million days have been lost through unemployment each week during the past few months and will be lost every week next year. Almost as many working days are being lost in one week as have ever been lost during a year and certainly more in two weeks than have ever been lost in a year in this country in modern times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I drew attention to why there are different and better standards of trade union relations in the European Community and in other European countries. Our industrial relations, as far as the Government are concerned, continue in the usual way—although that belief is not shared by many employers, trade unionists or trade unions. We are returning to the class war approach of the hon. Member for Teignbridge. That is not a good idea. The clause is unsound, wrong and damaging, which is why we shall vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The most telling contribution this morning came from the hon. Member for Meriden, who asked the Minister of State whether it would be possible for employers and unions to opt out of the clause and reach their own agreements. It was significant that that question was dumped by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial effects of the Bill on public funds are supposed to be absolutely minor—about £100,000. It strikes me that the significant cost would be met by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0449">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
employers—the Minister of State recognised that this morning. Why has the cost of the administrative burden on the civil service payroll—if we do not have a late conversion and the clause is adopted—not been calculated and added to the financial effects of the Bill detailed on page V?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and useful debate, particularly this morning, when Opposition amendments were dealt with so ably by my hon. Friend the Minister of State. However, something has gone amiss this afternoon. The Opposition must have picked up a different copy of the Bill from the one that I and my colleagues have. There is nothing in the Bill that would make check-off illegal. In paragraph 6.27 of the Green Paper, we stated:
	<br><q><p>"There is, of course, no question of making the check-off unlawful, as it is, for example, in France"—</p></q>
socialist France—
	<br><q><p>"If both an employer and a union member who is his employee wish to continue with this arrangement, they should be free to do so. But there is no reason why this arrangement should be imposed on an employee without his express consent."</p></q>
My hon. Friend the Member for Teignbridge spoke to his amendment, which the Government did not accept, but which was in line with proposals in the Green Paper. We listened to the concerns and decided, on balance, that a three-year renewal is no bad thing. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras told us about the freedom of the individual to make a choice. That freedom is there—it is enhanced by the Bill and it will be enhanced every three years when the employee expresses his wish for the deductions to continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. I see nothing wrong with that and believe it to be wholly right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was rather surprised by the hon. Gentleman's coded attack on people in our embassies and in our local authorities. In fact, it is possible to fall over the socialist local authorities that are looking for investment. They go to different countries and say, "Please come and invest in our part of England." The hon. Gentleman seemed somehow to attack those in embassies who are there to help obtain investment in Britain. I find that astounding, particularly as my constituency is less than two miles away from the largest single investment that has ever come to this country—Toyota will bring about £700 million of investment, along with car production and jobs. We should welcome inward investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

One of the reasons for such inward investment is the industrial relations record that has been achieved in Britain under Conservative Governments. We have tried to alter trade union legislation over many years. Every measure that we have introduced has been opposed by the Opposition.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
A thread of logic runs through the Bill and is the reason for these amendments. The Government aim is to attack trade unions and the rights of individuals in trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, we asked the Government several times why the changes were required, and we have asked again in Committee. Each time the Opposition have asked that question, the Government have failed to answer. However, we were reassured that the Bill was not simply a nasty piece of anti-trade union legislation. Its purpose was not to mess up trade unions, to make them unviable, to make their jobs more difficult or to undermine the basis on which they work. We are supposed to take that reassurance about clause 13 on trust. Yet, as some of my hon. Friends have mentioned, the famous letter that has suddenly appeared breaks that trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman was referring to the letter that the Minister sent to all members of the Committee. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) is being disingenuous because the Government made it clear that, when the Committee considers clause 14—I realise that we are not discussing clause 14, but I want to explain why the letter was sent to members of the Committee—a statement will be made about the issue to which the hon. Gentleman referred Therefore, I am surprised that the Opposition now complain that the Government are standing by, as we said that we would, and as he will see if he reads column 15 of our first sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must inform the Minister that I did not receive a copy of that letter, which is a discourtesy to the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to discuss the contents of the letter because it is irrelevant to clause 13. I want to establish why clause 13 is necessary. Time and again, the Government have asked us to trust that they are not trying to undermine trade unions, their functions or members. Yet the Government knew of information relevant to clause 14. They knew it on Second Reading; and they have known it throughout the proceedings of the Committee, but they spring it upon us at the last minute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister reassured us that the Government do not want to mess things up for trade unions, to interfere with their functions or undermine their strength, but we can no longer accept those reassurances. That makes the amendment all the more important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, during our earlier discussion, the Government could not tell us the purpose of clause 12. The Minister presented a case shrouded in obtuse responses, but failed to answer our questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 adds new reasons why a member cannot be expelled from a trade union for his conduct by introducing additional paragraphs to subsection 65(2) of the 1992 Act The result is a basic infringement of the International Labour Organisation convention, to which the Government adhere—they may have reneged on it, but they have not renounced it. Articles 2 and 3 of the ILO Convention of 1987 permit individuals freely to come together
	<br><q><p>"without distinction whatsoever, and to establish and join organisations of their own choosing … without need of authorisation, to draw up the constitution and rules, elect representatives in full freedom and organise their activities and administration."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0451">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
The Government were party to the convention, but they have ignored it. In other words, individuals will not be allowed to come together, form an association and draw up their own rules. However, the general law is consistent with those international standards. In the case of Cheall 	<i>v.</i> APEX, Lord Diplock quoted article 11 of the European convention on human rights, which states:—
	<br><q><p>"freedom of association can only be mutual; there can be no right of an individual to associate with other individuals who are not willing to associate with him".</p></q>
That is to be the case in every organisation apart from one: the trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that trade unions, in common with other organisations, do not have to adhere to common law. They do, but within the law of the land as stipulated, individuals ought to be free to form associations, to come together and to make choices about how to organise themselves. That freedom of association is open, provided that it is a mutual agreement. In other words, no member is obliged to accept another member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 43 deals with paragraph (g), which is to be inserted into section 65(2) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. We are not concerned that an individual may not be disciplined for resigning or proposing to resign from a union, but that he may not be disciplined for becoming, or proposing to become a member of another union. I am a member of two unions and neither would expel me because of that, but they should have a basis on which to expel me, were I to indulge in certain practices. Many individuals join a second union specifically to undermine the first union. What body would allow that to happen? Would the Conservative party allow an individual to join specifically to undermine it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency of Strathkelvin and Bearsden, two members of the Conservative party were expelled under powers that the Minister of State, who is in Edinburgh, did not realise existed—it is dubious that they did—simply because it was felt that those individuals were undermining the party. They were not saying anything untrue—they said that the Tory candidate during the previous election was a waster and not fit to be a Member of Parliament, and that all Tory voters should vote Labour. No one could disagree with that. It was true, but those members were expelled. I agree that the Tory party has every right to expel members. It is interesting to note that those two members joined the neighbouring constituency party, as they are entitled to do. Of course, they were instantly expelled from that party, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I am trying to make is that individuals coming together freely in an association must have the right to determine, within the law of the land, who can join. I do not want to hear the Minister say that that is the law of the land when it will not apply to unions. Within the general and common law of the land, unions must have the freedom and right of association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Oil Industry Liasion Committee are retaining their membership of two unions, joining another union specifically to undermine that union and to bolster their own union. Appealing to fairness, I believe that that cannot be correct. Therefore, there is no basis on which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
to prohibit a union from expelling an individual on those grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time will come when the OILC, for example, will send all its members to join the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union in order to undermine it, and the AEEU will send all its members to join the OILC, that would double union membership, and would be beneficial for the unions, but it is ridiculous. There is no level playing field. If it is correct and proper that we have a level playing field—the Government are always talking about that—and that there should be free and open competition among unions for members, surely it is correct that, within that free and open competition, no individual should be able to use his rights to undermine a union without being liable to expulsion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will not respond that that is partly covered by section 65(6) of the 1992 Act, which states:
	<br><q><p>"An individual is not unjustifiably disciplined if it is shown—"</p></q>
and goes on to list when that is applicable. That is about making assertions which may be true or false, but which would not prevent an individual joining a trade union simply to undermine it. People do not have to make false assertions. They do not have to go running to the 	<i>News of the World</i> or the Minister with stories. They undermine the trade union by obtaining membership lists and approaching people on those lists to get them to join another union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What other organisation, including the Conservative party, would allow a member to continue to be a member if that person was there specifically to undermine the organisation? Would the Tory party allow a member of the Labour party to attend its meetings to find out what it was doing, so that the Labour party could undermine the general election campaign? That would not happen, so it is unacceptable to apply that principle to trade unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey made the important point that legislation must always be seen to be fair, otherwise it is poor legislation that does not work. That is based upon the principle in society that everything should be as fair as possible. There is also the practical consideration that when laws are biased against a group or an individual, not only do they not work but they are less likely to be adhered to unless draconian and represssive measures are imposed. Those are piled on top of each other until finally the law breaks down. The respect for the law has been lost and the basis of that law has been shown to be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (g) would be unfair to one group of individuals. It would prevent those people from having the right to freedom of association and it would take away from the group its right to remove a member whose sole purpose was to undermine the organisation and to provide benefit to another organisation. The amendment would establish freedom and fairness for individuals by protecting their right to organise in free association.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) made a point about the ILO conventions. Lord Diplock was clear when he said that that matter has two sides. The conventions are well established. It is a pity that this Government do not want to maintain the principles that are being adopted by countries that are our mainstream competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not take notice of the views of the ILO and, indeed, of a leading member of our judiciary, the Bill will be fraught with difficulties before it is implemented. Perhaps it is intended to be a lawyers' paradise and to encourage the closed shops that have thrived under the current Administration. The ILO spelt out the absolute right to both sides of the freedom of association equation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden recounted the attractive analogy of infiltration into the Conservative party. From what I hear about Conservative party meetings, I would not enjoy them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is clear to the whole world. We are on a world stage this week as the leaders of Europe gather in Edinburgh and the eyes of the world are watching what happens there. I am sure that the world's media will note what is happening in this place during this week. It is important for the Government to illustrate that they intend to maintain their position in support of the ILO convention. I urge the Government to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply first to the hon. Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller). I refer them to the reply given by my hon. Friend the Minister of State to the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) at column 131 of the report of our previous sitting, when my hon. Friend said that the Government believe that nothing in the Bill contravenes any ILO convention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now refer to Government amendment No. 56. Opposition Members have expressed concern that the provision would prevent a union from disciplining one of its members who, whether in the capacity of a union official or as an ordinary member, sought to encourage other members to resign from the union and to join another of which the individual in question also happened to be a member. That is the main concern of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston. I shall give an example along the lines cited by the hon. Gentleman. I shall not use his precise example of the Conservative party, although I might be tempted to use the Labour party to see whether it has such an open and broad church, but you would rule me out of order, Mr. Knox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a shop steward in the AEEU attempted to persuade other AEEU members to resign and to join the Electrical and Plumbing Industries Union, or indeed just to join the EPIU—I believe that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said that that would be no bad thing in increasing union membership—would the AEEU be able to discipline him for such conduct, which would clearly be damaging to that union? The short answer is that it could, provided that that was the genuine reason for any disciplinary action. Nothing in existing legislation or the Bill would prevent that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell me which Act, and which section, allows that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision must be read in conjunction with the 1992 Act. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have looked at that closely and that that is the case. I may return to the hon. Gentleman on that matter to give him the reassurance that he requested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the new provision is to give individuals the right to decide for themselves, free from outside pressure, whether they want to remain a member of a particular union and whether they want to become a member of another union. The provision complements the new right contained in clause 11, which enables individuals to join the union of their choice. The Opposition did not support that clause, but I hope that they will at least recognise that clause 13 returns to the golden thread which consistently runs through the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us examine the case relating to the Retained Firefighters Union. The general secretary of that union approached the Department about an incident in which threats were issued against certain individuals who, by virtue of their main occupation, were members of my old union, the National Union of Mineworkers and, because of their secondary occupations, were also members of the Fire Brigades Union. They also had the option to belong to the Retained Firefighters Union. The individuals concerned decided that they wanted to resign from the Fire Brigades Union and join the Retained Firefighters Union, which they thought would better represent their interests. That decision was one that the individuals themselves should have been allowed to take without the threat of union discipline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that that view was not shared by certain union officials in the National Union of Mineworkers. The general secretary of the Yorkshire NUM took a completely contrary view and, far from feeling that the decision should have been made by the individuals concerned, was moved to write to the union convenor at the colliery where they worked, urging him to
	<br><q><p>"discuss the serious implications with the… individuals if this information becomes widespread at the colliery".</p></q>
There would appear to have been an underlying threat in that letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendment aims to ensure that the disciplining of an individual for resigning from another union is brought into scope. As the example of the Retained Firefighters Union illustrates, it is important that potential disciplining of members of one union in response to their resignation from another is covered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has voiced his concerns about victimisation. I share those concerns. If the Government are so concerned about victimisation, why do they allow selective dismissal of strikers? Is victimisation by employers okay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about the validity of the hon. Lady's point. I am dealing with clause 13. I am not sure to which examples the hon. Lady refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important to achieve the provision's intended effect and I hope that it will be supported by both sides. I hope that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras will withdraw his amendment. He is obviously concerned about which part of the Bill makes this provision. The union may discipline for any conduct
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0453">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
except the conduct listed in clause 13. Those provisions, particularly those in new paragraph (g), do not cover encouraging members to join a rival union. I hope that the hon. Gentleman now knows which paragraph to look at</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean that a member may be expelled from a trade union if he is a member of another trade union and uses his position in one union to undermine the other? If that is what he means, we are taking a significant step forward. If an individual joins a trade union just to undermine it, and it can be proved that he has undermined it, that would be grounds for disciplinary action and for the removal of that individual from the union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, provided that it can be shown that that is why the disciplinary action is taken. It must be taken for that reason and no other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When can a member be disciplined? I have some difficulty with that as I have not kept up to date with the legislation that has been passed since 1979 and during the 1980s, so I am not au fait with every part of recent trade union legislation. Is there no positive section in any Act which sets out the reasons why a member may be disciplined? As I understand the legislation, a member can be disciplined for any reason other than one of those listed in section 65 of the 1992 Act or in clause 13 of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I want to help the hon. Gentleman as much as I can. The answer to his question is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, I accept what the Minister has said and do not wish to press the matter any further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made.</i> No. 56, in page 27, line 40, after "union", insert "or from another union".—[	<i>Mr. McLoughlin.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 59, in page 27, line 46, after "union," insert
	<br><q><p>"where such work would not do damage to the union or harm its members generally or prevent the union from achieving its objectives.".</p></q>
I do not want to reiterate my previous arguments, many of which apply equally to this amendment. The purpose of the amendment is to try to achieve a balance. I am concerned about members who join, not necessarily another trade union, but any organisation or body that wishes to undermine the trade union; for example, the Economic League. The amendment would help to prevent that from happening. As the law stands, if a trade union knew, and could show, that it was being undermined by one of its members who was also a member of the Economic League—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not know where they are coming from, but I am receiving good vibes—could it discipline him? Does that apply to other organisations? I shall not mention any political parties, but what would be the position of a journalist on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
	<i>News of the World</i> who joined the newspaper in order to undermine it? Section 65(6) of the 1992 Act provides that a person cannot make false accusations. Is not that covered by the reassurances that the Government have already given?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is not in the nature of legislation to list the reasons why someone can be expelled. Such a Bill would be massive and no one could think of every possible reason. Therefore, it is better to propose general reasons why members should not be expelled. However, will the Minister make a clear statement about whether members who join other organisations may be expelled, not just because they are members of other organisations, but because they are undermining their trade union? That raises the following question: can a member of the Economic League be expelled for his membership of that organisation, even if it cannot be proved that he has taken the trade union list and given it to someone outside the union?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to explore the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and use an example so that we can be reassured about the effects of the clause if amendment No. 59 were not accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only natural that an organisation believes that it has a right to act in a way that helps to preserve its own integrity, in the wider sense of the word. Let us imagine that all trade union legislation applied to the Conservative party, which then had to put up with all the intrusions into the way in which it managed its internal affairs and balloted its members and whose members even got a vague idea of what was going on in the accounts, possibly by post, but certainly on a regular basis. The effect of applying an unamended clause 13 to any organisation would be difficult to justify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 11 sets up strict regulations in law about who can and who cannot be disciplined, expelled, accepted or refused membership, in a series of intricate ways. A trade union is allowed—with official sanction—to refuse a membership application on the basis of conduct. In the traditional way, clause 13 is now narrowing the basis of that conduct to work in with new legal definitions. Imagine that the Conservative party—this is not unimaginable—was thrust into massive internal dissension surrounding the slow progress through the House of the Bill on the Maastricht treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is perfectly legitimate for the hon. Lady to allude to the Conservative party, but she is tending to make a speech about it rather than about the matter under consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox. I meant only to mention that in passing to make my point. Imagine that a faction was created which might consist of some party members who had gone recently to the other place and who were seen in the Corridors a few weeks ago wrangling and harrassing individual members of the Conservative party on how they should vote. Imagine that they decided that they could no longer trust the way in which the current Conservative party was pursuing its policy on Europe and set up a shadow organisation—perhaps called the Nationalist Conservative party—the sole purpose of whose members was to do as much damage as humanly

possible to the remaining shell before they departed. That is the basic problem of the clause, which the amendment, if accepted, would solve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused by the hon. Lady's analogy. Perhaps a better analogy would be for her to tell us about the Labour party and Militant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to finish my analogy. Let us imagine that the Conservative party knew what was happening and wanted to deal with it, yet the trade union legislation had been applied to it. Surely, without our amendment, the Conservative party would not be able to discipline and expel those appalling people who were attempting from within to set up a breakaway organisation and destroy the Conservative party as it exists. Such a restriction is unwarranted on any organisation that must have as a prime aim the right and ability to protect its integrity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not here to answer for the Conservative party. It would be wrong for me to do so. One great issue that the hon. Lady does not understand about the Conservative party is that each constituency association is autonomous. Earlier, the hon. Member for

Strathkelvin and Bearsden alluded to some members who joined the neighbouring constituency association. The hon. Lady could have cited a better example than she did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, section 65 of the 1992 Act, as amended by clause 13, will set out the grounds on which disciplinary action can be taken. Clearly, the union is free to take disciplinary action on grounds that are outside the provision. Providing such action is not in contradiction to section 65 and paragraphs (f) to (i), the union would be free to discipline as the hon. Gentleman wishes. I hope that I have reassured the hon. Gentleman and that he will withdraw his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that reassurance.
