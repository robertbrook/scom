</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This fairly large group of amendments hinges on the word "reasonable". Hon. Members will realise that amendment No. 1 would delete the word reasonable and amendments Nos. 2, 3,4, 31 and 32 are all similar to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
It might be considered odd that Labour Members object to the word "reasonable", but that reflects our view of the National Rivers Authority's position concerning the barrage since the introduction of the private Bill. The Committee will recall that, when the private Bill was introduced, the Welsh water authority, which then dealt with water quality and other matters affecting the bay, petitioned against it. Because of its objections, the Cardiff Bay development corporation, doubtless urged on by the Welsh Office, over the following year or two, accepted some of the National Rivers Authority's suggested changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constitutional nature of the Bill causes a problem. Because it is a hybrid Bill which is Government sponsored, the National Rivers Authority's relationship to the Cardiff Bay development corporation has changed. The National Rivers Authority cannot oppose the barrage on conservation grounds, as that would run counter to the principle of the hybrid, Government-sponsored Bill. The National Rivers Authority is now in a different league, and cannot propose the sort of changes that it might have proposed to a private Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's point is amply illustrated by the National Rivers Authority's attitude to the proposed Usk barrage Bill. When it was proposed to introduce that Bill in the other place in a previous Session, the National Rivers Authority strongly opposed it and was free to express that opposition in the form of a petition, which it appears not to be in the case of this Bill, because—if I understand the position correctly—it is a Government Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the position to be exactly that. The National Rivers Authority can petition against the Usk barrage Bill because it is still a private Bill. It would argue that, because the nature of the Bill has changed, other agreements—termed side agreements—have been made with the Cardiff Bay development corporation and the Welsh Office on the changes that the NRA wishes to bring about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not propose to go into the detail of those changes, because I am sure that my hon. Friends will do that, and I would not want the debate to be repetitive, but, during the passage of all the Bills, the NRA has drawn attention to problems that still concern those who live in Cardiff and those concerned with water quality and the environment. The NRA identifies surface water flooding, groundwater flooding, sea defence, dissolved oxygen and water quality as being of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is said in the NRA's position paper about microbiology is of considerable significance:
	<br><q><p>"Because of the urban nature of the catchment, the bacteriological quality of the rivers Taff and Ely is poor"—</p></q>
the rivers are more polluted than normal because they run through industrial areas—
	<br><q><p>"and will largely determine the microbiological quality of the impounded waters. In consequence restrictions may be placed on the recreational uses of the impounded waters by the appropriate statutory authorities."</p></q>
In other words, certain recreational activities, which would normally be allowed on lakes or inland waters, will not be possible on the proposed bay because the waters from the Ely and the Taff are too dirty. That is a concern not only for those who wish to use recreational facilities, but for those who live in the immediate area of the barrage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
The NRA's point about blue-green algae is of great interest. I know nothing about blue-green algae, but the NRA—which I assume does know about the subject—says that that algae can cause two problems:
	<br><q><p>"They can form unsightly surface acumulations that the public usually perceive to be 'pollution'."</p></q>
The report, I am please to say, points out that the Cardiff Bay development corporation
	<br><q><p>"has agreed to harvest any surface scums and dispose of them elsewhere using equipment designed to clean-up oil pollution."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am no expert on blue-green algae either, but I saw an article in a national newspaper on Monday about a prohibition notice from North West Water on a pond near Wigan in an area that is popular with walkers. People were being told to stay away to prevent contact with the water which could poison animals and children because of the presence of blue-green algae.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The NRA highlights that risk, saying that the algae
	<br><q><p>"can produce toxins that can affect fish and/or other life."</p></q>
The report also states that the Cardiff Bay development corporation
	<br><q><p>"has commissioned an expert report which suggests that toxic conditions may develop in some years."</p></q>
Those conditions could lead to the death of many fish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is touching upon matters that are important. There should be proper safeguards to protect the users of the water when such circumstances arise. I am sure that my hon. Friend will accept that the problem of blue-green algae is not confined to the waters of Cardiff bay. It is a general problem which requires investigation all over the country. While water quality needs care and management, the standard of water in the Bute east dock, for example, which is used by the public, is similar to that in the bay. We should not overstate the worries and concerns about the water quality in Cardiff bay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going on to say that the development corporation has agreed to restock fish that are killed as a result of the algae.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lake will not, as some suggest, be stagnant, but, without great care and attention, it could, as the NRA has suggested,
	<br><q><p>"provide suitable conditions for the development of large populations of non-biting midges, particularly in the early years following impoundment".</p></q>
The NRA report continues:
	<br><q><p>"probably the most effective way of controlling midges in the impoundment will be a combination of chemical, biochemical, microbial and physical methods together with appropriate environmental management."</p></q>
The NRA also makes points about fishing and fisheries and about the water budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NRA could not have done its good work in bringing those points to the attention of the Cardiff Bay development corporation and stating its position in the document to which Labour Members have made public reference, had not it, and the Welsh water authority, before it, petitioned against the private Bill in the first place The NRA has a statutory duty and moral responsibility to ensure that, if the barrage is created so that a great lake is to exist in south Cardiff—for reasons that we will not discuss
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>114</span>
today—there are the best possible safeguards against contamination, pollution and the other matters that I have discussed. The best way of ensuring that that happens is for the Cardiff Bay development corporation to listen very attentively and take heed of what the NRA is saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our fear stems from the fact that the Bill lays down that it is for the development corporation to determine what is or is not reasonable if the NRA asks it to deal with certain matters, whether they be midges, microbiology, algae or anything else. But the NRA is a statutory body. Its importance in protecting our polluted environment is infinitely greater than that of the Cardiff Bay development corporation, whose raison d'être is, after all, to create better conditions for development in the south of Cardiff. The Cardiff Bay development corporation is neither equipped nor meant to be equipped to deal with the question of the environment or pollution. That is the role of the NRA. That is why we say that the Cardiff Bay development corporation must listen attentively to the NRA and take heed of what it says. The restrictions imposed by the word "reasonable" in the Bill could allow the corporation to decide not to take heed of the NRA's advice. That would be in no one's interest, least of all that of people living in Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 109 is slightly different from the others. It refers to the Secretary of State. The Minister will doubtless point out when he replies to the debate that, if there is a dispute between the Cardiff Bay development corporation in its role as the developer and the National Rivers Authority in its role as the protector of the environment, someone must decide who is right. Who will say that the NRA should take heed of this or that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill lays down that the Secretary of State should do so. We say that that is not good enough, because the Cardiff Bay development corporation is the creation of the Secretary of State. The link between the Cardiff Bay development corporation and the Secretary of State—it could be a Labour or a Conservative Secretary of State—is extremely close. I am not saying that that is right or wrong—it is a fact. It is neither equitable nor just that the Secretary of State in his office in Whitehall or in Cathays Park, should be the arbiter in a dispute between the NRA and the Cardiff Bay development corporation. The dispute should go out to independent expert arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are important. I know that several of my hon. Friends will contribute to the debate because the amendments concern water quality and the existence of microbiological and other life in the area of the barrage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to follow my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) on the relationship between the development corporation and the NRA. My hon. Friend has clearly spelt out one way of dealing with the matters of concern. The amendments offer the Minister various ways of dealing with the genuine concerns about this issue. I shall refer briefly—so as not to repeat the point made so well by my hon. Friend—to amendment No. 129, which would amend clause 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cardiff Bay development corporation is the creature of the Welsh Office. It is accountable to the Welsh Office and the Secretary of State for Wales. The NRA's position, like that of a number of bodies in England and Wales, is much more confused. I was a member of the Standing Committee that dealt with what became the Water Act
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>115</span>
1989. I recall warning the Minister of State at the Welsh Office about bodies such as the NRA and Ofwat being responsible to an unspecified Secretary of State. We were told that it was up to the Government to determine to which Secretary of State the body would be responsible, but that it would, of course, be the appropriate Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That response has proved to be a nonsense. The reality is that the rivers authority and Ofwat are accountable to the Secretary of State for the Environment. The Welsh Office and the Secretary of State for Wales do not have the clearly denned control over the policies and activities of those bodies which we in Wales want. The result is an imbalance. The NRA has a Welsh committee, but is not clearly accountable to the Secretary of State for Wales, but the development corporation is clearly accountable to the Secretary of State for Wales. There is a fear, therefore, that the Secretary of State might be inclined to favour his own body rather than that of a colleague, especially if he and his colleague are not on speaking terms. One is given to understand that that happens in the Cabinet from time to time. The situation must be made clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen was right—the NRA has responsibility for protecting the environment. I understand it to have clear obligations in respect of the kind of advice that it should offer the Secretary of State for Wales. I also understand that the Secretary of State for Wales is not given completely free rein. He has legal obligations concerning the way in which he regards any advice that the NRA gives him. If there is conflict between the NRA and the development corporation, therefore, there are pressures on him. As the Bill stands, it would be possible for the Secretary of State to take a decision to resolve the different views of two public bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 129 tries to ensure that the Minister would not simply toss a coin or express a personal preference when he resolved such a difference. There would be substance in the advice of both bodies, which he would have to consider before coming to a conclusion. He should appoint an expert assessor to assist him in considering any dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would mean that the views of the NRA and the development corporation were considered by an expert whose specific responsibility would be to give technical advice to the Secretary of State for Wales. There would be pressure on the Secretary of State for Wales to consider that information and to act reasonably on the basis of that advice. In the likely event that that advice supported the technical validity of the NRA's advice, it would strengthen the environmental considerations in the Secretary of State's deliberations and tilt the balance in the right way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is modest, but if the Minister is unable to accept some of the other amendments, it would give him a way of showing that there is a wish to be reasonable and to ensure that the Secretary of State gives full weight to the environmental considerations in coming to a conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deletion of the word "reasonable" in certain places is proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen. I have tried to insert the word reasonable into two Bills and we once had such a debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Winterton. Ministers then said that there was no need to insert "reasonable" because in common law the test of reasonableness applies. If that is so, presumably the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
Minister will have no difficulty in deleting "reasonable" because the Secretary of State would be constrained to be reasonable under the general requirements of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer and as I enter into these realms I see those Conservative Members who are lawyers perking up. They may be about to ride in to support that view, especially in view of the authority with which the point—based on legal advice—was made by Ministers. I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy us on some of these points and perhaps meet us half way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth on the word "reasonable", and in the fact that, in law apparently, reasonableness is assumed. That is a new idea for me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will speak about amendment No. 109. One of the very few elements of the previous Government's privatisation schemes of which I thoroughly approved was a consequence of water privatisation—the splitting off of the responsibilities for policing the waterways from the organisation that was chiefly responsible for sewerage and extracting water from the waterways. In Wales, the functions of the Welsh water authority were separated from those of the policing organisation, which was to be the National Rivers Authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill includes line 16, the organisation that will be chiefly responsible for the maintenance and functioning of the bay will again also effectively be responsible for policing water quality. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) has referred extensively to the fact that CBDC is the creature of the Secretary of State: all its members have been appointed by him. In a dispute between the CBDC and the NRA over what needs to be done to improve and maintain the water quality in the bay, the Secretary of State would have to choose between acting in the interests of his own creature and acting on the advice of the policing authority, the NRA, which is an acknowledged expert.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I can possibly agree to line 16, I should like some answers from the Minister. First, what precedents are there for views on water quality—on which the NRA is expert—being determined by a Minister or person responsible for water elsewhere in England and Wales? Can the Minister give examples of any likely disputes in which the NRA's view should not be paramount? I have tried to think of an example, but I cannot find one. If the NRA gives particular advice, who else can be turned to? Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth has a potential answer, involving an independent assessor, but the answer is certainly not the Secretary of State for Wales. His view should not be taken as equal, or greater, in importance to the view of the NRA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What confidence would Cardiff citizens have in a decision reached by the Secretary of State that was contrary to the advice he received from the NRA? Would the Minister, the representative of the citizens of Cardiff, North, be happy if a Labour Secretary of State ignored and overruled the advice of the NRA? I should like to hear the Minister's answers to those questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak to amendments Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 109 and make a few comments on water quality. As my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen said in his able speech the amendments hinge on what is reasonable. What is a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0254">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>117</span>
reasonable direction from the NRA? We think that the NRA behaves reasonably and responsibly at all times and that the word is, therefore, unnecessary. Indeed, in certain circumstances, it could be used as a loophole to dilute the NRA's instructions. These amendments seek to strengthen the NRA's authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the position in which the NRA is placed with this hybrid Bill. It cannot petition against the Bill. It is curious that the NRA opposes the Usk barrage, but has its hands tied when the Cardiff bay barrage is being considered. The rivers that will be impounded—the Taff and the Ely—are heavily polluted. The Ely is the most polluted river in Wales. At no stage in the NRA's short submission—we need more information—does it say how polluted the waters of the Taff and Ely are. If one barrage were to be built in Wales, the worst site, in terms of impounding polluted waters, would be Cardiff due to the large population and the industrial waste that flows into the rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite in evidence the national rivers survey, which was published by the NRA last year. It is a report of its 1990 survey. The NRA conducts a survey once every 10 years and, for the first time, in 1990, it found a deterioration in the quality of Britain's rivers. There were longer stretches of polluted rivers. Most of the rivers on the map are marked blue, which means that they are of good quality, but there are stretches coloured green which means fair quality, there are yellow stretches which means poor quality and there are some small red stretches—fortunately not in Wales—which means bad quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ely is marked yellow along its entire length, which means that the condition of the water is poor. In the Welsh Water region, 54 per cent. of total river length is classified as very good, 32 per cent. is good, 8 per cent. is fair, 5 per cent. is poor and 1 per cent. is bad. The Ely falls into the 5 per cent. category—its quality is in the bottom twentieth for river quality in Wales. The Taff is a little better although there are many green and yellow stretches in the Rhondda, the Cynon and the Taff itself. In Cardiff, the Taff s condition is described as "fair" and, within the classification, it falls into the bottom fifth for river quality in Wales. Therefore, the two rivers that we are impounding are quite heavily polluted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The barrage will block tidal water. Presently, the rivers are flushed twice a day by the tide in the Severn estuary. I should mention that the Severn estuary around Cardiff and further upstream around Newport is described as "fair". It is the only estuary in Wales that is not described as "good" or "very good". It has the poorest water quality of any estuary in Wales. So, the last place that a barrage should be built, in the interest of water quality, is across the Taff and the Ely in Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the water was like a mountain stream—crystal clear, pre-industrial and pre-agricultural—it might make sense to impound it in an estuary to create an artificial lake, but as the water from the Taff and Ely is heavily polluted, we would be asking for big environmental problems. The NRA report does not so much ask whether there will be problems as suggest how to ameliorate problems as they arise. The report predicts serious problems such as algae blooms and low oxygen occurring on a regular basis so the question is how to cope with a disaster once it has taken
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
place. As I said, the tides currently flush the waters and the estuary clean twice a day, but by building a physical obstruction and impounding the water, the tidal action will be stopped and the tidal water kept out. When there is high river flow during the winter after heavy rain, the impounded water will stay behind the barrage for four or five days, before it is discharged into the sea, but in the summer, or during periods of drought, the water will have a resident time of 40 or 50 days. The water will be like a stagnant lake but will be continually fed by nutrient-rich and polluted waters from the Taff and the Ely. Problems will occur, particularly when the river flow is low, when the rate of replenishment or cleansing is at its slowest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NRA report predicts clearly that algae blooms will appear in the summer; the waters are nutrient-rich, high in phosphate, nitrate and other fertilising elements. I am slightly critical of the NRA's submission on that point as it gives no analysis of the chemical contents of the Taff and Ely, so we have no idea how bad things will become. The report states that in summers such as 1976 and 1984, the number of algae blooms would be significant. Weather records show that for five of the 13 years up to 1990 they would have been significant. That means that for one year in two, there will be problems with algae blooms. Apparently, the SLURP technique is being advocated to ameliorate the problem—blooms are simply skimmed from the water surface. I am not happy with that idea as it just ameliorates a problem after it has occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendments Nos. 1 to 4 seek to delete the word "reasonable" because we feel the NRA's requests of the development corporation will at all times be reasonable. Oxygen content which is of the essence for all animal life in water. I am pleased that clause 7(2)(b) prescribes that there should be
	<br><q><p>"not less than five milligrams of dissolved oxygen per litre at all times."</p></q>
If that could be achieved and maintained, it would be a modest safeguard against major environmental problems. Whenever levels threaten to fall below five parts per million, oxygen injection is needed. How often and at what cost oxygen injection is used may become a regular quarrel between the NRA and the development corporation. We do not know, critically, whether oxygen injection works. This is a matter of life and death for fish and animal life in the river; there must be a minimum of 5 mg per litre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens when the biological load on the water is such that oxygen is depleted? We want to resuscitate the river through oxygen injection. The River Towy in my constituency has problems downstream from Carmarthen because of the nutrient-rich waters that have entered through sewage and oxygen injection has failed to deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The mechanism proposed by the NRA in its reasonableness, to cure the problem is, it feels, sufficient. I have also asked the view of Dr. Stoner. The costs are another matter, but the mechanism would suffice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central. I hope that he is right that it is just a matter of the rate of flow of the Towy in Carmarthen. If the water were diverted into a stagnant pool, oxygenated, and then returned to the river, perhaps our problems would be ameliorated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that I had the same confidence as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central on oxygen injection technology. I tried to find evidence in the report of the Select Committee on the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill that such technology works. I looked at the evidence given by Dr. Charles Pattinson, who has a doctorate in oceonography, has worked for Welsh Water and the National Rivers Authority for a total of 16 years, and is responsible for oxygen, algae and sanitary quality of water. He is the NRA's expert on oxygen injection. At page 343 the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Mr. Coombs) said to him:
	<br><q><p>"Perhaps I could explore some aspects of the technology with you. First of all, the vitox machines. How old are they? How long have they been in use in various parts of the world?"</p></q>
Dr. Pattinson replied:
	<br><q><p>"I am afraid I do not know. A number of years; but I am afraid that I am not aware of the exact length of time; but bearing in mind we were discussing these things with the Corporation in 1988 or 1987 they were proven pieces of equipment available on the market at that time; so they have clearly been around for a number of years."</p></q>
The next question was:
	<br><q><p>"Have you had any personal experience with them?"</p></q>
to which he replied, "Not myself."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He was asked:
	<br><q><p>"Are they large or are they small? Are they noisy? How much do they cost?"</p></q>
Dr. Pattinson replied:
	<br><q><p>"I have no idea about how much they cost. They are fairly substantial devices. I suppose it is how you judge scale."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
So, it transpires that an NRA expert on oxygen injection had never seen the machine, except on a video and had no idea about its cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When water is impounded in Cardiff bay we know that in the summer there will be problems and serious problems once every two years, yet the oxygen injection is an unproven technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Library's research notes, which were distributed as guidance to all members of the Committee, have this to say about the Vitox system:
	<br><q><p>"field trials have not been able to demonstrate unequivocally that injected oxygen is effectively dissolved, dispersed and retained.".</p></q>
So we are building this enormous lagoon knowing that there will be problems with the water quality and that for one in two summers at least, and perhaps for several weeks of every year, there will be severe oxygen problems. Yet we do not know whether the technology that is supposed to ameliorate that will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the word "reasonable" in the amendments. It is important to strengthen the NRA's hand in its dialogue with the Cardiff Bay development corporation. As my hon. Friends and Members for Cardiff, Central and for Torfaen said earlier, the corporation was set up by the Secretary of State and there is a danger of a cosy relationship developing between his Department and the corporation. I am very unhappy about the way that the NRA's hands have been tied in criticising the Bill. The NRA cannot object to the barrage proposal en bloc; it can only advise on how to tackle problems when they arise. I ask the Government to omit the word "reasonable", as the amendments suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to reinforce some of the comments made by my hon. Friends the Members for Torfaen, for Cardiff, Central and for Carmarthen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments would help to satisfy three cases. People are worried about the excessive power that the Bill grants to the Secretary of State as the final arbiter in any dispute between the NRA, for which he is not responsible, and the Cardiff Bay development corporation, for which he is responsible. The three cases are: first water quality, secondly fisheries and thirdly major changes in British or European legislation, which could affect the responsibilities of the Secretary of State, the NRA, or the development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The least of my worries is water quality. If a problem arises about the cosmetic virtues of water in the bay, I shall not be very worried, because the pressure on the Secretary of State to back the stronger environmental line would oblige him to choose the verdict of the NRA, not that of the Cardiff Bay development corporation. The people of Cardiff and elsewhere, as well as potential investors, would put pressure on the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about fisheries. If there was a disputed verdict between the NRA, with its statutory duties to protect the aquatic environment—an obligation that was not placed on the old Welsh water authority—and the development corporation, the Secretary of State might be pressurised to support the corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should include more rights for the NRA in the Bill—we should not use the Secretary of State as the long stop, the fall back, the judge, the ultimate appeal, the last word. For example, on a fine summer's day, all the sailors whose yachts are in the marina in Cardiff bay wish to sail. The summer is as hot as the summers of 1976, 1984, 1990 and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0256">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
1991. There is a low flow. The sailors wish to go out of the bay, but the salmon wish to come in. The salmon and sewin swim around, awaiting the right conditions for interest to be created in their sensitive apparatus, which tells them that it is time for their spawning run up the Taff and Ely rivers. They know where to go, because they smell the fresh water when it flows into the sea. However, on this particular day, not enough water flows down the Taff both to release water through the fish pass and thus create interest in the salmon and sewin, and to allow the boat locks to be operated. The mathematics are simple: the proposed size of the fish pass requires a flow of 15 cu m per second—larger than in the original design—whereas the flow down the Taff and Ely rivers might be one third of that. Therefore, the NRA could issue a direction to the Cardiff Bay development corporation, saying, "Sorry, you can't use the boat lock this weekend." At that, the corporation will throw up its hands in horror, crying, "What are all the yachtsmen going to say? They'll go potty. We've just announced an increase in the marina charges. They'll all want to use it in this beautiful weather. They'll want to go to the regatta in Weston-super-Mare, or Barry island."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NRA will answer that the corporation cannot operate the boat lock and the fish pass, because the combined new flow of water down the Taff and Ely is only 4cu m or 5cu m per second. The reduction in flow of the Taff and Ely in dry summers is amazing; they dwindle to a virtual trickle. In contrast, the fish pass is very large. The NRA may want to let all the water out through it because it has detected a run of salmon and sewin waiting to come up on their spawning run. Yet the Cardiff Bay development corporation will try to get hold of the Secretary of State to back it up on the matter, and never mind the fish. That would be a tricky situation and I am not sure that I could be happy with the Secretary of State having the last word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point concerns the possibility of a major new initiative being taken by the European Community when the Department of the Environment, the Welsh Office, the Scottish Office and the NRA nationally produce a final definition as to what constitutes a sensitive water under the municipal wastewater directive. Such a definition will probably appear before the Bill has completed its passage through Parliament. The municipal wastewater directive is law, but cannot be implemented because the sensitive water definition has not been agreed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that that definition will imply that the impounded water behind the Cardiff bay, Taff and Ely barrage is a sensitive water which will require phosphate stripping, as is mentioned in one of the last pages of the NRA position document. That document makes clear the possibility that the NRA could, in certain circumstances, insist upon the phosphate stripping to ensure its compliance with legislation on water quality. What would happen if the Cardiff Bay development corporation disputed that decision? It could say that the extra £20 million or £30 million involved would make the project awfully expensive at more than £200 million. It could say that although phosphate stripping is standard technology in Germany, it has never been used in this country. It could say that it did not know where the land would come from that could be used to take the rivers Taff and Ely off-line so that they could be passed through iron and aluminium reaction tanks and then brought back into line stripped of phosphates. It could claim that such technology may be fine
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
on the Rhine, given Germany's prosperous economy, but that Cardiff bay should be exempted by the Secretary of State from fulfilling the NRA's request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, would the Secretary of State for Wales make the decision according to the requirements of adherence to the best modern environmental practice, or would he say, "The Cardiff Bay development corporation has my ear. I do not want a last-minute, embarrassing increase in the barrage's capital costs. I think I'll side with the development corporation on this matter."?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we have offered an entire nap hand of alternatives, including using assessors or a panel of arbitrators consisting of people with an interest in the environment but who are not committed either to the NRA or Cardiff Bay development corporation. We have also suggested, through the use of the word "arbitration", that the matter could be left to the Minister to produce his own ideas on Report if he accepts that the Secretary of State—who is, in effect, the parent of the Cardiff Bay development corporation—should not have the final word in such circumstances. Opposition Members want an assurance that no favours will be shown to the Cardiff Bay development corporation in the event of a dispute between it and the NRA in Wales on any issue of water quality, fisheries or environmental standards stemming from European legislation or elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before dealing with the substance of the amendments, I wish to clarify a matter concerning the National Rivers Authority which emerged in the Committee on Tuesday. The 	<i>Official Report</i> of those proceedings records that I responded to the hon. members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Cardiff, West by saying:
	<br><q><p>"subject to agreement with the NRA, I shall be happy to table amendments relating to side agreements."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 30th June 1992; c. 102.]</p></q>
In fact, I said that, subject to agreement with the NRA, I should be happy to table the side agreements themselves. I believe that that is what hon. Members might recollect and understand, so that remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm that there are two agreements currently under discussion involving the NRA. The main agreement is between the NRA and the development corporation. The NRA is also a party to a separate agreement on flood protection which also involved the city council, development corporation and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The NRA has now responded indicating its willingness in principle to publish those documents. However, it has commented that, while it is satisfied with the progress made in discussions with the development corporation, there remain a few points of detail to be resolved before the agreements are finalised. Quite properly, it has indicated that it would prefer not to publish before the final documents are available. I shall, therefore, arrange for the final documents to be placed in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West referred to the fact that the private Bill contained considerably more detail than the current one on the NRA's role. That was simply a reflection of the different drafting conventions relating to private and Government legislation. The agreements include operational matters which would not normally figure in a Government Bill. I can, however, reassure

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for responding to points that we raised with him at our previous sitting. Were the two draft side agreements part of the original private Bill? In other words, are those side agreements substitutes for legislation or would they have been side agreements anyway?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will check on that point for the hon. Gentleman, but I believe that the NRA is satisfied that all that should be in the Bill is in the Bill. However, I should not like to leave anything uncovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are largely about reasonableness, as the hon. Member for Torfaen said, but I must resist them on the ground that they would weaken the NRA's powers of control over the barrage and the inland bay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not envisage many, if any, references to the Secretary of State on the basis that directions by the National Rivers Authority are unreasonable. However, without the test of reasonableness there would be no basis for the Secretary of State to determine whether any direction was "justified" as amendment No. 19 envisages. The test of reasonableness is a familiar one in law. It is, for example, the test applied by the courts in judicial review proceedings. We do not wish to see the Secretary of State take over the functions of the NRA, which has statutory responsibility for these matters. Still less do we wish to see an arbitration panel of the type proposed usurp these functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen suggested that the best control over the inland bay is for the NRA to have control, but that is exactly what the Bill provides. It is not the case that the Cardiff Bay development corporation decides whether NRA directives are reasonable. If the development corporation thinks that an NRA directive is unreasonable, the Secretary of State decides whether the direction is reasonable or not. Only if it was unreasonable would he overturn it. That puts the NRA in a strong position, which is what Opposition Members want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Cardiff, South and Penarth and for Cardiff, West feared that the Secretary of State would favour his own body. The Secretary of State has an absolute duty to adjudicate fairly and would be subject to judicial review if he did not. Under the terms of the Bill, all he has to judge is whether an NRA directive is reasonable and not whether it is the directive that he would have issued himself. I hope that I have responsed to the points of both hon. Gentlemen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In an almost identical context, the same lawyers advised the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Welsh Office, to resist the insertion of the word "reasonable". It is not reasonable for the word "reasonable" to be treated differently in different contexts and for it to be interpreted in opposite ways depending on whether the Government or the Opposition wish to add it to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understood him right I think that the hon. Gentleman wants to remove the word "reasonable" and leave the matter to the general powers to which he referred earlier, which would provide a test of reasonableness. Yes, we could leave it to the courts to judge reasonableness, but that would be a much more cumbersome way of resolving disputes about such specific matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central asked about what sort of disputes could arise in which the National Rivers Authority's view would not be paramount. Frankly, it is hard to foresee that happening, but, from time to time, statutory bodies have been judged by the courts to have acted unreasonably and it is not an impossible eventuality. The hon. Gentleman also asked what confidence Cardiff citizens would have in a decision that was counter to the National Rivers Authority's advice. That is the same point as that raised by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West who doubted whether he would be confident to leave the final word with the Secretary of State. It is not a question of leaving the final word with the Secretary of State. As we all realise, if my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, or any of his successors, made a perverse judgement, he would be overruled in the court. Therefore, he would not have the final say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the approach to reasonableness depends on the test of it and not on whether it is a decision that the Secretary of State would have chosen to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the same test of the Secretary of State's decision would apply even if the word "reasonable" were deleted from the Bill?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do not we all want to be more reasonable as time goes on? I am sure that we do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the test of the word "reasonable" will remain the same, but I still hold on to my view that the thrust of the amendments, which is to remove the word, would make the Bill more cumbersome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth made special reference to amendment No. 109.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for the answers to two of my three questions.

I trust from his non-answer that there was none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman's question necessarily follows. It is not a matter of precedent, but what functions my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will have. As I said—this was the answer to his question and I had hoped that he understood that—the matter depends on whether my right hon. Friend feels that the National Rivers Authority is being reasonable. That is what he must decide. It does not follow that there are precedents for that. In answer to the hon. Gentleman's other questions, I said that such circumstances were hard to envisage. However, we cannot rule them out because there is a possibility, however remote, that they may emerge.

However, we are not talking about precedents, but the concept of reasonableness, which is why I responded to the hon. Gentleman in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth wanted me to refer specifically to amendment No. 129, which mentions Cardiff city council's environmental health officer. I agree with the spirit of his remarks. I would wish to see the fullest appreciation of environmental health—a most important subject—but I am not convinced that it would be appropriate for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to have to act on the advice of a district council's chief environmental health officer. The National Rivers Authority has a national role in water quality issues. The city's environmental health officers also have a role to play, but that will be covered appropriately in regulations that will be made to protect Cardiff city council's interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but he is confusing two amendments. He referred to the advice of Cardiff city council's chief environmental health officer, which comes under amendment No. 10, and which is an alternative way to deal with the matter. I referred specifically to amendment No. 129, which deals with the advance appointment of an expert assessor, and which would not necessarily be limited in the way that he described when referring to Cardiff city council's chief environmental health officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and I am grateful to him for his correction. I misread the amendment number. I was referring to his remarks on amendment No. 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen was anxious that the good work, as he put it, of the NRA must always be considered. He also wanted to ensure that the Cardiff Bay development corporation listens carefully to whatever the NRA has to say. The current provisions of clause 7 reflect a lengthy process of consultation between the Welsh Office, Cardiff Bay development corporation and the NRA. The NRA has not requested the removal of the Secretary of State's role, as is proposed in the amendment. As has already been said, the NRA has expressed content at the way in which its interests are covered by the Bill and by amendments that I intend to table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth suggested that the NRA's position has changed because this is a hybrid Bill. The hon. Member for Carmarthen was also anxious about that. There is nothing to prevent the NRA from petitioning on any matter of detail on the Bill. The NRA has not chosen to do so because it is fully satisfied with the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will have to decide, in the light of the particular circumstances of each issue referred to him how to fulfil his role and whether he needs to seek advice. That will not rule out occasionally seeking expert advice from outside the Department. However, an amendment to the Bill is not required for my right hon. Friend to seek such advice, and it is not justified to require the Secretary of State to do so for every such decision. It would not be practical or reasonable for the wide range of bodies and interests specified in amendment No. 130 to arbitrate on matters in which the NRA has national expertise and statutory responsibility. Such issue are properly the responsibility of the Secretary of State acting in a quasi-judicial way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The hon. Member for Carmarthen mentioned some practical examples to broaden our consideration of the matter. I suggest that he sought simply to criticise the NRA's conclusion that water quality will be acceptable. That directly contradicts other Labour Members who have agued that the NRA should be the arbiter of such matters. The NRA does not agree with the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have followed the Minister's remarks closely in the hope that he would refer to amendment No. 129. He did not do so as he actually discussed amendment No. 10. Will he do that before he concludes his remarks? It seems that many of his objections to other amendments are overcome by that option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just said that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State could take advice from outside the Department. Indeed, I imagine that he would. It would not however be reasonable to require him to take such advice from an arbiter on every decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify the matter. The Minister may have misunderstood the precise import of the amendment, which says not that the Secretary of State must take advice on every item, but that he
	<br><q><p>"shall not over-rule any direction by the NRA without receiving the advice of that assessor."</p></q>
In other words the Secretary of State can uphold the NRA in a direction without being required to to go to the independent assessor but if he is minded to overrule a direction, he must take that technical advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a small and modest requirement, dealing with circumstances which the Minister and others say are extremely unlikely to occur. Only in those unusual circumstances would the Secretary of State need to take the advice of the assessor in order to be seen to be acting "reasonably".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not necessarily a million miles apart: the hon. Gentleman seeks to do something in statute that I would expect to be done in practice. Amendment No. 129 would unreasonably require that something be done in circumstances which, I agree with the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth—and tried to say in answer to the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central—are a remote and unlikely possibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I always prefer such things to be clear and in statute. Is the Minister offering the undertaking of his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that in such unlikely circumstances he would excercise his freedom to make that appointment and take that expert advice without the requirement being statutory?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that it would be highly likely that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would want to take advice from an assessor. It is highly likely that he would want the best possible advice from inside the Department and from outside. In that remote eventuality, he would seek all the advice he could. I do not believe that it is necessary to bind him to go down that road in all circumstances but I would expect him to do so. It could be material in a court's consideration of whether he had acted properly or perversely. Any Secretary of State would want to take the best advice before proceeding, not least because decisions might ultimately be tested in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said earlier that he did not believe that the NRA was restricted in taking a position on the Bill. Am I right in believing that the NRA has misunderstood the position as described in its position document. The NRA states:
	<br><q><p>"This restricts the scope of the NRA to petition against the Bill … Specifically the NRA cannot petition against the principle of such a Bill … In effect this means that the NRA cannot, even should it so wish, oppose the Barrage on conservation grounds on the basis of its General Environmental Duty."</p></q>
Is the Minister saying that the NRA has misunderstood the position, or is the NRA able to petition in that manner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not suppose that the NRA has misunderstood the position, but I am assured that the NRA is free to petition against any detail in the Bill and that it has chosen not to do so because it is happy with the Bill and any other arrangements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The NRA document refers to the NRA having recommended a possible solution to the problems of controlling pollution.
	<br><q><p>At page 59, section (e) is headed: "Remedial measures to prevent excessive algae growth".</p></q>
The report then states:
	<br><q><p>"No easy remedial measures exist; the two that hold most promise are the stripping of nutrients from the inputs to the lake"—</p></q>
I made the point earlier about phosphate stripping—
	<br><q><p>"or the construction of a partitioned barrage; both of which are expensive."</p></q>
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The partitioned barrage—allowing the Taff and the Ely to flow down the middle of the barrage while keeping a pond around both sides of it—was the NRA's original preferred option when the measure was a private Bill. The NRA attempted to persuade Cardiff Bay development corporation of the merits of that option. It clearly still holds that view but is unable to petition the Government because of the restrictions referred to earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. That is a considerable restriction on the NRA's ability to petition against the Bill and, in the Minister's word, to be happy with everything that has happened so far in relation to the barrage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is my understanding: everyone regards the NRA and its statutory responsibilities as being most important. It is a natural aspiration to have the greatest measure of agreement with the NRA and with everyone else. I hope that the Committee will resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall resist at least one of the Minister's points. I do not intend to pursue the "reasonableness" argument except to echo the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth that the Government constantly refuse to accept "reasonableness" as introduction and conclusion in clauses. It is therefore unusual that the Minister will not accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall presss amendment No. 109 to a Division because it relates to arbitration. It is unreasonable that a Secretary of State who appoints, directs, finances and makes propaganda about the Cardiff Bay development corporation should be associated with it. It is his creature. The Minister said that the Secretary of State was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. That is bunkum. How can a Secretary of State who is entirely responsible for the body that creates Cardiff bay act as judge and jury in a dispute
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>128</span>
between that body and the National Rivers Authority? It is absolute nonsense, and the people of Wales will accept it as such. Anyway, the Secretary of State has too much power and he should not be given any more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister even turned down the modest and reasonable request by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth that the Secretary of State should keep the powers but, when exercising them, should appoint an expert assessor to assist him. The Minister said that he probably would do that, so why cannot such a provision be included in the Bill? No decision taken by the Secretary of State that is the direct result of a conflict between his body—the Cardiff Bay development corporation—and the NRA will have credibility or command public confidence. The relationship between the Secretary of State and the Cardiff Bay development corporation will be seen as too cosy when the Secretary of State has to act as a judge, as my hon.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the amendments were inspired and suggested by the elected city council of Cardiff. It is important to put it on the record that that body is in favour of the Cardiff Bay barrage and that it envisages economic benefits resulting from the creation of that barrage. I hope that when the Minister responds he will bear that in mind, and that he will understand that the amendments are in no way regarded by Opposition Members or by Cardiff city council as being wrecking or mischievous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I use the word "mischievous" because of an article about the Cardiff bay barrage that I read yesterday in the 	<i>Western Mail.</i> Colonel Inkin, the chairman of Cardiff Bay development corporation, who in an earlier capacity was chairman of the Cwmbran development corporation in my town, referred to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West as being mischievous. Doubtless, there are occasions when he is, but in general during the debates on the Cardiff bay barrage my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West—like my hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) and for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Owen Jones) and the Minister, who also represents a Cardiff constituency—has expressed genuine and sincere views on ways in which improvements could be made, given that the barrage is to be built. It was wrong for the appointed chairman of the development corporation to make gratuitous remarks about members of the Committee. I hope that he will see reason and perhaps publish an apology in the 	<i>Western Mail.</i> But that is a diversion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would ensure that the water was impounded behind the barrage in the first instance at a height not exceeding 4 metres AOD to enable the development corporation to assess the impact of a rise in the groundwater table. In English of the kind that can be understood in the south Wales valleys, that means that the lake would not be filled to its full capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for the amendments is sound. There were different views about the Hydrotechnica report, and the city council, which gave evidence to the distinguished Professor Lloyd, made some criticism of Hydrotechnica's approach. Whether or not we agree, there is uncertainty about the impact of the proposals with regard to the possibility of groundwater flooding. We will not know what happens until the lake is filled with water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that it takes from six months to one year for a water table to stabilise, and that only then will we know what effect the water has on the surrounding buildings and land. The amendments would ensure merely that the water level was no higher than 4 metres, which would allow us to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
see what effect that had on groundwater, after which a decision could be made about whether to raise the water level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The barrage is intended to be aesthetically appealing enough to attract development. Filling the lake to a lower level would not detract from that appeal to commercial developers. The amendments are reasonable and would reassure the city council, the residents of Cardiff, and all who are worried about the impact of groundwater levels. I hope that the Minister will accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am still a member of Cardiff city council I can comment on the origins of the amendment. The city council has requested that we approach the creation of the bay with several elements of caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the 4 metres line was originally suggested by a former lord mayor of Cardiff, Councillor John Smith, who represents Grangetown. That area is, I believe, the lowest-lying part in the city, and is nearest to the sea. Councillor Smith not only represents that area but has lived there all his life. He believes that many of the fears that have been expressed about the development of the bay have been overstated. Indeed, he is a supporter of the barrage. However, he is rightly anxious that the residents of his area in particular are not adversely affected by the dangers that groundwater may pose to their properties by causing dampness and other problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councillor Smith did not propose that the barrage should not be built or that water levels should not eventually rise to the levels requested by the CBDC. He made the reasonable suggestion that there should be a period of a few years during which the water is kept lower than the ultimately desired level to reassure people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If problems occur at 4 metres, as it has been suggested they may, we can try to ameliorate them. If those problems arose and the water level was not maintained for a period of time, but reached 4·5 metres immediately, they would be far greater. If the water level was maintained at 4 metres AOD, that would create the desired environmental effects. It would cover the mud in the estuary and a vista of water extending from Penarth across the bay would still exist. There would be no deleterious effect on the proposed improved environment of the bay. The level would need to be maintained for only two to three years to assuage people's fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a modest proposal. If the Minister represented a more low-lying constituency in Cardiff, he would be more than willing to support it. I ask him not merely to look down from the great heights of his constituency to the low-lying parts of Cardiff to see the glorious lake, but to descend to the ground and understand how it appears to the people of Grangetown. The Minister should accept the amendment, because it represents the views of those who support the idea of a barrage but wish to ensure that ultimate safeguards are included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak about a variant of the ideas presented by my hon. Friends the Members for Torfaen and for Cardiff Central.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with uncertainty. Nobody knows what the side effects of the barrage will be. One builds a barrage with the best engineering and costing advice that one can get. However, one cannot know until a year after one has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0261">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>131</span>
built the barrage, effected the closure and set the level of the lake, how the mudbanks and plains of accumulated silt on which old Cardiff is built will affect the water table. If one is wrong, the consequences for large areas of housing will be terrible. If one is right, and the groundwater reaches a settlement level in the underwater lake beneath old residential, downtown Cardiff, there will be adverse consequences. The lake will either affect property prices or create rising damp in houses from the heroic period of Cardiff's expansion 100 years ago, from 1870 to 1914 when the Welsh coal trade was at its height.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that uncertainty about the consequences of the barrage for the settlement level of the water table underneath old Cardiff, the amendments are eminently reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not know about Councillor John Smith's part in the origin of the amendments. I knew that they had been prepared in the drainage department of the engineers department, and in the legal department of Cardiff city council, but that does not contradict what my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central said. They have a good pedigree because they come from people who deal daily with the problems of housing at the lowest level above ordnance datum, built on the aluvium between Leckwith hill and Rumney hill—virtually all of old Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of Wales's reputation for hills, old Cardiff does not have a two-foot molehill to boast of. The area, which is built on the silt washed down by three rivers, is as flat as a pancake. Those who deal daily with the area's engineering problems—the drainage, maintenance of sewers and so on—have experience of the effect of the mud on drainage and on parks used for leisure activities, such as walking the dog or playing football.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The framework of knowledge and experience of people such as Councillor John Smith and the city engineers is important. They were instrumental in suggesting the gradual build-up to the chosen level. A balance must be struck between the amount of mud needed to form the so-called golden pond to attract investors and the risks of the inevitable rise of the water table under the dry ground on either side of the banks of the River Taff and Ely. There is little doubt that old Cardiff will be affected but we do not know exactly how. A defence mechanism is needed and the amendment would provide it. The amendment states:
	<br><q><p>"A lower leval may be specified in place of four metres, if so recommended by the Advisory Committee on the advice of those with particular knowledge of groundwater engineering."</p></q>
Much knowledge has been built up in the engineer's department of Cardiff city council, in the four years of to-ing and fro-ing about the barrage, others have acquired expertise on the subject. We want an advisory committee that can adjust the level of the pond and the coverage of the mud against the rising water table and its consequent effect on the houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled by my hon. Friends train of thought, he seemed to question the assertion of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff Central that the author of the proposal was Councillor John Smith. I understand that he is the author and the amendment therefore has a good pedigree, the Minister will recall, from his time on Cardiff city council, that John Smith has a reputation for attention to detail. He goes through all the papers available on any issue meticulously before forming an opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend must have misheard what I said. I did not attempt to take any credit from Councillor John Smith. I merely emphasised the part played by the legal and drainage departments of Cardiff city council at the appropriate officer level. It is the combination of the political experience of councillors such as John Smith and the experience of legal and drainage officers that makes the amendments so valuable to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Superglue seems to have been attached to the trousers of Conservative Members of the Committee, who have remarkably little knowledge of or interest in these issues. They have not participated except to put up their hands at the right time. Opposition Members are reliant on our own local knowledge and interest and on the knowledge of those who represent the areas that will experience any side effects of the barrage. We rely on that expertise and on democratic feedback. Whose backsides are going to be kicked if the engineers give the wrong advice and the side effects are greater than anticipated? It will not affect hon. Gentlemen who represent Worcester, Westbury and so on; it will affect those of us who represent the areas concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why an incremental approach to the barrage is vital. It means building in greater expert advice on groundwater matters to determine the level of the barrage, taking into account its side effects on the rising water table underneath the houses on both banks of the Taff and on at least one bank of the Ely. The residents of downtown Cardiff must be satisfied that the Committee has properly scrutinised the risks to their homes, parks and football pitches before a final decision on the barrage is taken. I hope that the Minister will respond in a spirit similar to that in which the amendments were drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, as the hon. Member for Torfaen said, Cardiff city council was the originator of the substance of the amendments. It is beneficial to have the hon. Member for Cardiff Central who is still a member of Cardiff city council, on the Committee I am hesitant about responding in too great detail to Councillor John Smith, who is a fine past lord mayor of the Welsh capital city and a strong member of the Council because the last time I spoke about John it was so fondly that I was warned I might have impaired his reselection prospects—I certainly do not wish to interfere in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff Central urged me to remember the ground level but my constituency does not consist entirely of the high ground of Cardiff: the river Taff, albeit at an increasing level, runs past Mynachdy, the Gabalfa estate, Llandaff North, Forest Farm and Tongwnlais. The Gabalfa estate has suffered as badly as other parts of Cardiff from the flooding of the river Taff. I am in no way divorced from a gound level approach to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never said that there was a problem with flooding. If the groundwater levels get to your constituency, there really is a problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for the constituency of Macclesfield, but I know that the groundwater provisions would protect my constituency as much as any other Cardiff constituency. I hope that gives the hon. Member for Cardiff West an opportunity to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister made a pertinent point. Although he was not representing it at the time, his constituency was very badly affected by the 1960 floods. It was perhaps the biggest single volume of water that has come down the Taff: the peak flow was measured at 900 cubic metres per second. The whole of the Gabalfa estate was flooded to a considerable depth. A high levee was subsequently erected as a flood barrier to protect that estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents believe that the 1979 flood, which did not affect the Minister's constituency, affected my constituency far more badly than any other. The water was unable to burst the banks of the Taff above Blackweir and burst into Riverside and Pontcanna further down, flooding that area far more badly than the original flood area, even though the peak flow was believed to be substantially lower than in 1960 at only 800 cubic metres per second or perhaps less. The fundamental principles by which every one must abide is that the water must go somewhere and that whatever flood protection measures are taken do not remove the water but merely divert it to a different course. That is the problem with almost every flood. The subsequent flood protection work causes weakness in other flood protection measures because the water is diverted to the next weakest point in the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, Central has already responded to that by alluding to the fact that the barrage will be a major improvement in a protection against flooding for the whole of Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the general thrust of the debate, considerable work has already been carried out on the implications of impoundment at 4·5 metres above ordinance datum. The Select Committee that considered the private Bill requested a year's additional work followed by a three-month consultation period on groundwater. Following that, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced that, in the light of the responses received and independent expert advice, he was satisfied that all the technical, economic and safety criteria could be met with a barrage with this level of impoundment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the exhaustive work that has been done, it would not be appropriate to give the advisory committee the power to vary the impoundment level at some indeterminate date. Equally, I see little advantage in informing the advisory committee if the level of the inland bay rises above 4·5 metres. Such matters are the responsibility of the National Rivers Authority in respect of its flood prevention responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal that there should be a phased impoundment was suggested to the Select Committee by Cardiff city council. After hearing the city's evidence, the Committee rejected its suggestion. The Chairman of the Select Committee said:
	<br><q><p>"we do not believe that anything would be gained by impounding water by stages."</p></q>
Stage impoundment is neither justified nor desirable. Proceeding immediately to level 4·5 above ordnance datum will give time to carry out preventive remedial works should they prove necessary to an extent beyond that already envisaged. Moreover, to leave the level at 4 metres for a year would mean either delaying the post-impoundment survey, with consequent uncertainty, or the disruption of a further survey for householders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
Amendment No. 124 seeks to fix an impounded level of between 4 metres and 4·5 metres AOD within the whole of the inland bay rather than immediately behind the barrage. The inland bay extends upstream as far as the Wiggins Teape weir on the River Ely and Blackweir on the River Taff. The effect of impoundment at a level of 4·5 metres does not extend as far upstream as Blackweir. The river bed level at Blackweir is at 7·25 metres above ordnance datum. That is almost where the area meets my constituency at Mynachdy.

I hope that hon. Members will accept that because of the way that the Bill is drafted—by defining the level immediately behind the barrage—we can rely on the effects of gravity to achieve the intended level throughout the bay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another set of amendments where the Minister has several options before him. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central, who speaks with authority on behalf of Cardiff city council, argued that the 4 metres level should be retained for one year, as amendment No. 6 suggests. I do not follow the Minister's conclusion that that would lead to delay in the pre-impoundment survey. Surely it would mean that the pre-impoundment survey would go ahead, the post-impoundment survey might have to wait for a short time until the level had been brought up to 4 5 metres, but it would enable a reasonable assessment of any effects to be made during the year. Although I agree that the analysis of the effects of impoundment have been examined in great detail and that there are belt and braces around every calculation made, so there is every reason for certainty, surely our modest amendment would reassure people who, however unjustifiably, are worried by the propaganda propounded against the barrage over recent years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman implied that it must increase uncertainty, or occasion delay, if the impoundment were staged from 4 metres to 4·5 metres. What we presently envisaged in the post-impoundment survey could not follow in the same way if staging were introduced. Uncertainty and anxiety for his constituents would inevitably result. The hon. Gentleman has been the first to champion their interests. Staging might raise the fear that a further survey would be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of a further survey becomes relevant only if the impoundment has a detrimental effect. If that occurred at the 4 metres level, a survey might be needed straight away, but that would be because of effects which we believe are highly unlikely. So a further survey would become relevant only when the level reaches 4·5 metres and the effects are seen. It is then that the post-impoundment survey would be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the post-impoundment survey becomes necessary only when detrimental effects to property are seen, it is unlikely that there will be a need for anything after impoundment up to a level of 4 metres. Moreover, it is unlikely that anything will be necessary at a level higher than 4·5 metres. Surely, problems will not arise immediately after impoundment at the level of 4 metres. That is why a staging operation with a specific time limit would provide a reasonable reassurance. It would not challenge either the Minister's position nor mine on the general effects of impoundment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the unlikelihood of such problems arising but that, equally, we should also consider such consequences. However, a staged impoundment would add to uncertainty and increase anxiety. Work has been carried out on the basis of 4·5 metres AOD, and I consider that the greatest certainty would be achieved by proceeding along the lines of that conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 26 would require the barrage sluices not to be tide-locked for more than two hours. That would be not only beyond any requirement ever stated by the National Rivers.Authority—which is content that its flood protection responsibilities would be safeguarded—but could be achieved only by a significant increase in the impounded level with the result of the flood defences being over-topped in some circumstances. I hope that the Committee understands why I must firmly resist the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will understand why we must press the amendment to a Division. We must remember that the authority, the members of which were elected by the people of Cardiff, is in favour of the Cardiff bay barrage. The Minister said that a staged impoundment would increase uncertainty. It is our view and that of the people who represent Cardiff that the opposite is the case and that a staged impoundment would reassure people who are currently worried about the problems of impoundment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff South and Penarth has mentioned the word "reassurance" more than once, and that is what the amendments are about. It is significant that Cardiff city council suggested the amendments, and we would be wrong if we did not press at least one amendment to a Division. That would ensure that the people of Cardiff are aware that the wishes of their elected city council have not gone unheeded in Committee.

I hope that the hon. Member for Cardiff West will agree that the Government amendments obviate the need for amendment No. 27 and that he might be prepared to withdraw it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment No. 29, there is clearly a vital role for the lifeboat services where there is an incident requiring their involvement. The development corporation is already obliged to inform the coastguard and any radio station operated in connection with the barrage. Those requirements are already set out in clause 8. Informing the coastguard will ensure that the lifeboat service would be involved where circumstances required it. Normally, the way to call out the lifeboat service to deal with emergencies is to inform the coastguard. I see no reason for there to be different arrangements in this connection and the Committee should therefore reject amendment No. 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 125 and 127 seek to give priority to the conservation and development of flora and fauna over the use of the bay for pleasure craft. There will always be conflicting interests for the use of water in the bay. The development corporation has sought to strike a balance between those interests. The overriding interest must be the control of flooding and water quality and those points are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0264">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>137</span>
included in clause 7(1), under which the National Rivers Authority can issue directions on the method of operation of the barrage to protect their statutory functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to the National Rivers Authority direction, the Bill proposes that both conservation and the development of flora and fauna and the requirements of pleasure crafts shall be considered but without prescribing priorities. Clause 12 provides that the inland bay and outer harbour shall be managed so as to facilitate their use by pleasure craft and for water sports and other open-air recreational activities. The amenity use of the bay is recognised as an important feature, including in clause 13(3) an acknowledgement of desirability of enabling the local community to participate in low cost water sports and other open-air recreational activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agreements with the Royal Yachting Association on the design of the barrage have provided the facilities required for the use of pleasure craft and open-air recreation on the inland bay. The requirements to consult with the Countryside Council for Wales and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and to have regard to the desirability of developing and conserving flora and fauna protect the conservation interest. It is greatly preferable to leave the Bill unamended and to enable the development corporation to discuss and agree with both the Royal Yachting Association and the conservation bodies the method of operation to be followed. That will satisfy the requirements of both groups rather than trying to set priorities. I therefore hope that the Committee will not pursue those amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to direct the Committee's attention to amendment Nos. 127 and 29. I shall speak slightly slower than the Minister so that we all have a chance to understand what the amendments are about. If I heard him properly, the Minister said that the amendments were about whether one can prioritise in statute. It is a tricky problem for hon. Members to decide whether we can order the obligations in clause 8 to determine between conflicting objectives when the crunch comes and make clear what the development corporation, which owns and operates the barrage, should do in given circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raised a similar point on environmental issues in respect of the National Rivers Authority, the Cardiff Bay development corporation and what the Secretary of State might do when the fish are waiting to come up and the boats are waiting to go out. The Minister will accept that he did not answer that point. I hope that he will be able to respond now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 127 and 29 are specific because we believe that an element of prescriptive prioritising by statute is a good idea. The Minister has referred to the procedures that are used to save lives if a ship or boat is in trouble in the channel. The Barry coastguard is informed, lifeboats are launched and other smaller craft may dash out. That will not necessarily be as easy to do after the barrage is built. Sailors in trouble outside the barrage will face increased risks because there will be a barrier across the mouth of Cardiff Bay. Therefore, we must consider the position of the marine rescue service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the coastguard is informed and lifeboats are launched. However, because Barry is 10 miles from Cardiff, the Barry lifeboat may not always be the first to reach a ship
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>138</span>
or small boat that is in trouble outside the mouth of the river Taff, near Penarth head or off the ledges in Cardiff. I have been told that a small boat from Cardiff Bay is normally the first to reach a sailor in trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then have to consider whether the radio, the coastguard service or the telephone is the best means of directing rescuers to a ship in distress. We face two problems. First, because of the sheer bulk of Penarth head, there is a substantial area of radio silence in Cardiff Bay and a message cannot be sent from Barry coastguard to boats that are just off Penarth head. The second problem is the construction of the barrage. Lifeboats will have to pass through locks and, obviously, the journey will take much longer than at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 127 includes the words:
	<br><q><p>"subject to the overriding requirements of maritime safety, shall give greater priority to the need to conserve the flora and fauna in the bay than to the requirements of pleasure craft and other vessels.'."</p></q>
Our first priority is maritime safety and the prevention of people drowning or getting into serious trouble in the bay. That must be a major consideration when a physical barrier is erected across the mouth of the bay. Because of the locks, delays to rescue services will occur. Our second priority is the conservation interest and the preservation of fish and other wildlife. That must be taken into account by the development corporation when it makes any plans for the development of the bay. Our third priority is for pleasure craft to regularly use the bay. Quite rightly, people want a bit of fun in their yachts. It is not an anti-sailing amendment. Those who go sailing, but get into trouble at sea will be the first priority. Sailors who are not in trouble will be the third priority and between those will come the conservation interests relating to flora and fauna.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understood the Minister's high-speed delivery correctly, he said that, according to his legal advice, the prioritisation that we seek is impossible and that we must accept the development corporation's word on the matter. I hope that he will amplify his comments. I am pretty sure that he would accept the spirit of what I have said by way of illustration and that he understands the intention that lies behind the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can agree immediately with the hon. Gentleman's final words. All hon. Members accept the spirit of what he said, but the difficulty lies in achieving that in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West described a theoretical situation, in which a small boat is rescued by another small boat. However, that situation must remain only theoretical. No small boats may be available in such a situation, either post-barrage or pre-barrage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is virtually inconceivable. At all times of the day, either in the bar or around and about the edges of Cardiff bay, people are near small boats. People are mucking about in their boats even at dead of night. Somebody is always near a Cardiff Yacht club telephone, or is available in some other way. The Minister has described a nonsensical situation which would never arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to pursue the hon. Gentleman's theoretical argument. I accept that his description is true in practice, but in the theoretical argument we would not envisage the use of alternative small boats. In practice, it is likely that such boats could weel be used, but in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0265">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>139</span>
theoretical situation that I put forward I imagined that the formal bodies—the coastguard and the lifeguard—would be called upon. That will continue to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I accept the spirit of what the hon Member for Cardiff, West said, in that maintaining safety is the natural priority of everyone involved in any such situation. As we go about our everyday lives—whether in our homes or our cars—we naturally take every action to save life and avoid the risk to life whenever we are aware of danger or risk to life. We are together in spirit on that matter, but I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's argument that it is possible or appropriate to define that in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident, given the natural, overriding priorities, that the development corporation will always try to maintain the best balance between all the interests in the circumstances. Initially, it will adopt the view that flooding and water quality must take priority. However, I cannot imagine that any group of human beings would allow such formal priorities to override the natural inclination to save life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what the Minister has said, and in the expectation that we may be able to return to the matter at a later date, I shall not press the amendments in my name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Can the Minister explain the purpose of subsection (7)? The removal of that subsection would strengthen the rights of boat owners, householders or those who have an environmental interest when a pollution incident occurs. What could people do, if they were worried about their boats, houses, or environment? What could they do if their dog licked water from the barrage and consequently suffered pains? They would be in a better position if they did not have to prove negligence. The ordinary citizen is unlikely to be able to call on the services of expensive solicitors and barristers, or even cheap solicitors or barristers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, the removal of subsection (7) would leave the development corporation at risk of being held liable for any costs, even when no negligence on its part had occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

At risk of another debate about reasonableness, the amendment does not seem reasonable. The tidal nature of the bay at present restricts access by vessels. The barrage will provide greater access because of

the constant water level that it will create. However, it would clearly be inappropriate for the development corporation to bear the costs incurred by others during the very limited instances when access would be restricted. These would not be frequent occurrences. They would probably occur only when the development corporation operated the barrage in accordance with specific directions from the National Rivers Authority, for example to protect water quality or fisheries. We do not believe that the development corporation should meet costs which might be incurred by third parties on such occasions bearing in mind that, for the most part, the barrage will provide much improved access facilities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the reason is nothing more than the usual subtle or dramatic difference between the way in which private and public Bills are drafted.

Clause 7 will require the corporation to operate the barrage in accordance with directions from the NRA on, among other matters, water quality.

Clause 11 will require the corporation to manage the inland bay and to comply with any direction from the NRA to ensure that the water quality meets the relevant standard.

This is an important part of the Bill because the relationship between what might be called the marina features of Cardiff Bay and the bay's attractiveness to investment and people who might buy yachts and houses on its edges is critical to the scheme's success or failure. The analogy commonly used by the chief planning officer of Cardiff Bay development corporation is that the Cardiff Bay area is currently the backyard and should become the front garden of the city of Cardiff. The clause is about whether the area, is to become the front garden, or the boatyard rather than the backyard, of the city. We need to know how many people will want to live in houseboats and what revenues will be paid for tourist operations utilising water taxis and water buses round the bay.

As has been said, Cardiff Bay is not a simple bay but one with two long fingers up and down which water buses might ply—for example, to Blackweir, and beyond the city centre to the papermill along the River Ely. There is a three-mile long finger from the lake—as one would normally think of it when using the phrase "the inland bay".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend have information on how the water buses will get under the bridges, or are all the bridges to be replaced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only tell my hon. Friend that that is not my problem. Clause 12(2)(b) refers to
	<br><q><p>"the use of water buses, water taxis and other vessels plying for hire".</p></q>
That is not my idea: it is part of the package that we are being sold and we are testing whether it makes sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole Bill turns on clause 12 in relation to the justification of public expenditure and the closure of the two estuaries. The clause deals with the cosmetic nature of the treatment needed to make the development attractive. If it works, it will attract boat owners and the type of investment that goes with the social class that we normally associate with them. That does not apply to the present owners of boats in Cardiff Bay, who are quite ordinary people—many of them my constituents. But the expectation was that there would be a future class of boat owners who would carry investment power and lots of shares in privatised companies and so on. That image was completely trashed by the collapse of the stock market in October 1987.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not further try your patience, Mr. Winterton, by continuing along that line, but I believe that you know what I am referring to. All the provisions in clause 12 are meant to convey the idea that the barrage will allow the creation of marinas and facilities for yachts, boats, houseboats and so on. In turn, that is meant to create a whole new aura and image for docklands regeneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not explore whether that will work because we have already dealt with that matter. I am questioning the viability of that package of ideas, some of which may be as impractical as was implied in the intervention of my hon.

Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones). No doubt the Minister will tell us whether those ideas are still viable or whether some are in the Bill because the Government did not want to change the drafting. They may simply want to confer on the Cardiff Bay development corporation powers to undertake activities such as hiring out water taxis and leasing space for houseboats and other moored vessels, in which case there will be an obligation to maintain the water quality so that people will want to have houseboats in the area. Cardif Bay development corporation will be sued if the environment does not meet the standards of houseboat owners used to Chelsea-type conditions. People will be extremely upset if they find that they are not living in a Welsh equivalent of Chelsea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that living in Cardiff, South would be far preferable to living in Chelsea, and that considerable benefits will accrue to people who have the sense to come and live in close proximity to such excellent communities as Aplott and Grangetown. I Hope that my hon. Friend was not suggesting that Cardiff, South is to be dragged down to the level of Chelsea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that intervention is noted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was noted in the spirit in which it was intended. We do not want to lose votes in Chelsea or in Cardiff, South and Penarth, even with an election three or four years away. And the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) has taken a close interest and spoken frequently in Committee about the comparability of Battersea and Cardiff for houseboat owners and others, has he not?

We must test the Government's intentions. How manyof the powers do they expect to be used? How viable is the picture that they present of the delights of craft bobbing up
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>144</span>
and down in the water, in accordance with the powers conferred by the clause in respect of water sports and pleasure craft? The NRA states in its document that it understands that immersion sports will not be allowed. There are not many water sports, including small dinghy sailing, that are not immersion sports. There will be problems if the barrage is designed so that small dinghies cannot be used, and large dinghies will also cause a problem because of the size of the locks that would be required. If neither large nor small dinghies are to be allowed, what sort of dinghies will be allowed? The Minister should tell us how he envisages practical effect being given to the powers under clause 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we are hearing from the hon. Gentleman is, I think, a rehearsal of the debate that we shall have on clause 13, which is more specific. The hon. Gentleman may want to reserve his arguments until then so that he will not be ruled out of order again for being repetitive or tedious. Knowing the hon. Gentleman, I suspect that when he develops his arguments, particularly on amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 36, he may answer his own questions. I am content to be patient until we reach clause 13.
