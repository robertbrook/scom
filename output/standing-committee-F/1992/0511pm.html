	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I wonder whether you can help us. As new clause 9 was starred, would the Minister be prepared to withdraw it and to introduce it on Report? I understand that argument is developing on its implications for direct sellers. I had a meeting outside the Room with a gentleman who represents direct sellers. He did not read the new clause until this morning and I do not feel competent, after five minutes' briefing, to speak on it and to raise matters of importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I understand the hon. Member's concern, but that is not a point of order for the Chair. I have no doubt that the Minister heard the hon. Member's comments, and perhaps he will respond through the usual channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Cook—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member must accept that that is not a point of order for the Chair. My role is to follow the procedures and Standing Orders. The matter raised is one for discussion in another way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before lunch, the Minister was expressing his enthusiasm for a free market in potatoes, which he believes is in the national interest. Some of us are sceptical that a free market in potatoes exists or that it will exist in future. The point that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) pursued with the Minister was the degree to which subsidies exist for potatoes in the European market. It is difficult to obtain coherent and accurate information on that. My hon. Friend referred to telephone calls to his relatives in Italy. It is clear that substantial subsidies exist in France to help potato growers. Social security payments are phased by Departments and priority loans are given. In a raft of measures 700 million francs are available for early growers, 40 million francs for maincrop growers at harvest and 20 million francs for maincrop growers at late harvest. The position is the same in Spain, Portugal and Italy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Italy there is substantial intervention in the market by way of subsidies. It is difficult to get to the bottom of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
matter, but it is clear that the Government intervention agency—the AIMA—subsidises growers, co-ops, producer organisations and processors. There is no free market, and some of us believe that even if a European lightweight regime could be introduced, the subsidies would continue. I am aware of the strength of the agricultural lobby in this country and abroad and it is common sense that producers will not give up those subsidies easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were pressing the Minister to tell us what work he knows of in the Commission on the scale of subsidies in the European Community. That information would help to put the debate in context. Producers in this country do not want subsidies to exist in future. They want stability in the market because of the need for high investment and improvements in efficiency. I believe that rather than having subsidies—concealed subsidies in some cases—the best way forward would be to have a quota system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potato marketing scheme in the past 30 years has been a participatory arrangement whereby producers, processors, consumers and other interests have come together to plan for the future. Many of us accept the need to plan for the future and want stability in the market, and we feel that the desire to get rid of the potato marketing scheme now is premature and a leap in the dark.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shortly before we adjourn for lunch, my hon. Friend the Member for Workington referred to the Government's failure to come clean and produce documents that they demonstrably have in their possession. They have failed to learn important lessons. They should have at least picked up on the grapevine the reasons for what happended last Thurday. Newbury was mentioned earlier: I draw the Minister's attention to a parallel situation in Neston—which is part of my constituency—where, in the county elections, for the first time in history, the Labour party took control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that against the background of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington and those of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when I questioned him during our seventh sitting. I asked him whether he would respond to the worries of the arable committee of the Cheshire National Farmers Union. The right hon. Gentleman answered succinctly; he was clear and to the point. Indeed, he would have passed his key stage 3 test. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Because that committee is wrong."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 4 May 1993: c. 227.]</p></blockquote>
Far be it for me to help the Minister at a time when his party is in such a dilemma, but I suggest that there is an important lesson to be learnt. I hope that the Government will take note of the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Workington and not shroud in secrecy any documentation relating to a most important matter that is worrying producers in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning, the Minister told us that it was in the national interests for the potato marketing scheme to be wound up. It was interesting that he did not define the national interest. He seemed to say that if a measure was good for the processors, it must be good for the country. I refer the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
Minister to my comments in previous debates about his role and that of the joint consultative committee. It is clear from the composition of the joint consultative committee that the national interest is well represented: it includes representatives of customers, consumers, processors and producers. No organisation has a majority. The 19 members, with their independent chairman, have made unanimous decisions over their three years of operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has never explained who can represent the national interest in the context of the potato industry if the JCC cannot. He believes that the potato marketing scheme means that we are exporting jobs to Europe, increasing the acreage grown there and suffering imports. However, that argument does not hold water when we consider the investment by processors that has been made and is planned. Do the processors intend to import all those extra potatoes to satisfy the extra capacity? The Minister does not say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that the potato marketing scheme meant that between 1978 and 1992 the industry successfully replaced 100,000 tonnes of imports of early potatoes—no mean feat. If the JCC were demanding more and more acreage, it would have been possible to say that the potato marketing scheme had been a failure. That is not happening. The Minister has final approval of the target acreage recommended by the JCC. If that is not in the national interest, why does he not do something about it? He has the power to tell the JCC to think again or to accept its recommendation, or even to suggest a much greater acreage to satisfy the processors' demands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have said before that the clause represents an unnecessary and dangerous leap in the dark. I urge the Minister especially to reconsider the winding-up of the guaranteed price. Last year provided an example of the operation of external forces. The weather in Egypt and Cyprus last year caused their seasons to be later than normal. That cut into the early potato market in this country, where the very mild season meant that English potatoes were brought on earlier. The result was a glut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier in our proceedings I noted that the value of the Pembrokeshire crop virtually halved between 1991 and 1992, even though the tonnages were almost the same. The guaranteed price ensured that, if they did not make a profit, the producers at least had a reasonable amount of income. They still lost money: I am told that there was a shortfall of about 30 per cent. between what they received from the guaranteed price and the actual cost of production. However, the guaranteed price at least provided a base income for the producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must not run away with the idea that the guaranteed price system is a form of subsidy. The Committee is aware that in the main it is a levy demanded from producers. A small proportion currently comes from the Government, but that is to be withdrawn. The scheme is self-supporting, and the Minister has offered no truly cogent arguments to explain why the potato marketing scheme and the guaranteed price system should be wound up. I assume that this is the Committee's final stting, and I hope that the Minister will advance those arguments this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause would simply end the financial guarantee that applies to potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
Our debate has ranged widely. The joint consultative committee has been set up to manage an existing scheme, not to consider wider interests or to make assessments about the national interest. Similarly, Ministers who have to judge recommendations must do so within the framework of the scheme. It is not open to them to disagree with the entire scheme and to start from scratch, as the hon. Member for Workington suggested. That is not practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The guaranteed price is a subsidy. The hon. Gentleman claimed that it is a self-supporting scheme. The sugar regime is supposed to be a self-supporting scheme, but I have not met an hon. Member who believes that it is anything other than thoroughly pernicious. The same logic applies to the guaranteed price for potatoes. It imposes an economic cost because of the way in which the mechanisms work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a long debate and I have already said clearly that some elements of the scheme mean that we must reflect on it. When we make our decision, if it is taken outside the context of the Community regime, we shall consider all matters, including the relative position of producers. The clause ends the financial guarantee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly about the clause. I tabled amendments to try to clarify it and to impose more specific duties on the Minister. Perhaps we can reconsider those issues on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to register a continuing concern in all sectors of the industry that the provision should not simply be a form of words. A lively debate on the clause occurred in another place. The annual price review will not happen in the future in the same way as it did in the past. I believe that it is the view of many hon. Members, and people outside the House of Commons, especially in the agriculture and horticulture industries, that the annual opportunity for Government and Parliament to review the circumstances in which the industries are thriving—or not thriving—is important. For the foreseeable future, there will be a great deal of public investment in agriculture, and thus there will be public anxiety about value for money from European and Exchequer funds. It is important, therefore, that the annual report is not a parliamentary game. It should constitute a method by which the country can understand what is happening to the industry. The increase in available information is vital whether or not we like the process by which it is gathered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, I asked the Minister to tell the Committee what information was available as a result of the IACS submissions. Someone who reported our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0165">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
proceedings believed that IACS was a reference to a Greek island. Therefore, for those who are not aware of this bureaucratic monstrosity, IACS is the integrated administration and control system. The Minister was kind enough to say that after his mind was cleared of minor issues, such as fishing and the Bill, he would be able to tell the Committee this afternoon the precise proportion of eligible holdings that have now submitted complete and admissible IACS forms and documentation. I do not know whether the Minister can give the us the precise figure. Within the context of the information that should, in future, be available if the threatened IACs system works with its threatened spy-in-the-sky connotations, I hope that the Minister can give us a reasonably accurate guesstimate of the proportion of forms that have now been submitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I admire the hon. Gentleman's dexterity in bringing that matter on to the agenda. The answer to his question is that at noon today, our offices had received roughly 59,000 forms—the figure was rounded to the nearest 100—many of which had been handed in rather than posted. The figure is likely to rise sharply, almost by the hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of the clause, we are committed to continuing to publish a report on agriculture in the United Kingdom. I note what the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) said about the substantial nature of its contents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The boards have expressed fears that some of these activities might not be completely within their existing powers under the provisions of their respective milk marketing schemes.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause should be added to the Bill to provide that if a single successor to the milk marketing board emerges under an approved scheme of reorganisation, arrangements are established to supervise its future trading practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the United Kingdom joined the EEC, milk marketing arrangements have been highly regulated and governed, not only by general EEC and domestic competition legislation but by three specific EC milk regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A move towards a non-statutory system is a move towards an untried system. The dairy industry forms a large part of the agricultural sector and it is important that any change in its operation and trading methods is monitored to ensure that the interests of all concerned are adequately met by the change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is already known that during the first two years of a successor's lifespan, the EC Commission would not, of its own volition, intend taking any action against a new co-operative under articles 85 and 86 of the EC treaty. It is also well known that if a third party sought to challenge a new co-operative by means of a reference to regulatory authorities or through the courts, such a challenge could be time consuming and costly to resolve. We have heard examples of the situation at Cricket St. Thomas, which underline the need for the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When approving a scheme of reorganisation, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be prepared to put in place a means of supervision that would serve to highlight and speedily resolve any activities in dairy marketing that gave rise to concern during the formative stages of a new marketing system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an interesting new clause and I wonder how far the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Marland) is prepared to press it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, we all received on the Board a letter from the Minister. In part, the letter dealt with the competition regime that will exist following vesting day. Perhaps I may quote the section of the letter dealing with monopolies and anti-competitive practices. Paragraph 10 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Fair Trading Act 1973 applies controls to monopolies as well as to mergers. A scale monopoly exists where one company or group
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
of interconnected companies accounts for at least 25 per cent. of the market for specific goods or services in the United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
I draw attention to the last sentence. The letter then refers to a complex monopoly involving a number of separate companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 11 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the Act."—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Fair Trading Act 1973—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the DGFT can refer cases to the MMC for investigation if he considers that a monopoly exists."</p></blockquote>
I draw attention to the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"if he considers that a monopoly exists."</p></blockquote>
The paragraph continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State has a similar power to make references. The MMC must then consider and report on whether a monopoly exists and whether any behaviour by companies, which can be attributed to the monopoly, is against the public interest.</p></blockquote>
The letter further states:
	<br><blockquote><p>If the MMC finds effects contrary to the public interest, the Secretary of State has power to remedy these."</p></blockquote>
Under the section of the letter dealing with the position of a co-operative, it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Agricultural co-operatives are subject to these controls."</p></blockquote>
I may be labouring my case but I shall make a simple point. It seems inevitable that if Milk Marque gets 80 per cent. of the market, there will be a monopoly. We are not talking about EC considerations; we are discussing domestic law, the provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973 and how they relate to the existence of a monopoly in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers might be inclined to say, "We must see what will happen", but I am not satisfied with that response because we do not necessarily need to wait to see what will happen. We know what will happen in advance—there will be a monopoly of milk supply in the United Kingdom in the hands of one organisation. I want to know whether that means that the Secretary of State will automatically have to refer the existence of that monopoly from day 1 to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission with a view to an inquiry, because the note says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Agricultural co-operatives are subject to these controls. At present the DGFT may not make a monopoly reference relating to the wholesale supply of raw cows' milk. Any such reference must be made by the Secretary of State acting jointly with the appropriate agriculture Minister or Ministers (depending on the area of the UK concerned). This restriction will be removed by secondary legislation when the Milk Marketing Schemes are revoked.".</p></blockquote>
I do not think that I have misunderstood the position, but is it correct that immediately Milk Marque announces that it has 80 per cent. of the market, Ministers will have an interest in ensuring that the matter is referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission? Otherwise, we must have great sympathy with the new clause of the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West. He proposes to deal with the matter in another way and is saying that there must be a procedure to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers must bear that in mind, and we should be told what the Government's position will be when that huge monopoly has been created.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To respond to the hon. Member for Workington, the Director General of Fair Trading or the Secretary of State can refer to a monopoly, if it exists, but they do not have to refer it. It is not inevitable that Milk Marque will be referred, provided that it trades fairly.
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
Everything will depend on its behaviour. In formal terms, the discretion of the Director General of Fair Trading or the Secretary of State cannot be fettered in advance, so there is no question of automatic referral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was agreed in the Committee, especially with the hon. Member for North Cornwall, that the key is not the sign-up rate but the actual behaviour of the susbsequent body. Earlier, we established that when Milk Marque sent a letter to its potential customers which seemed to propose policies that reflected a monopolistic view of life, it had to revise those proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us get it right. Milk Marque was instructed to revise them by the Secretary of State, acting without power. I understand that he simply had a word with the milk marketing board and said, "You can't do that."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, the Minister has a word, but he was not the only person to do so and I believe that the milk marketing board rapidly came to the conclusion that it had made a false step in that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Finally we have had an admission that the Minister had a word. That is an interesting development, because it means that the authority of the state had to be used to exercise some control over the excesses of Milk Marque acting in a predatory way in the market. Ministers may find that difficult, because we shall no longer be dealing with a statutory authority after vesting day, so we must establish a machinery that enables those matters to be dealt with. Ministers will not be able to lift the telephone or dance down to Thames Ditton to tell the body what it can or cannot do. They will not have that power, unless an appropriate amendment is slotted into the Bill. I hope that the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West will press his new clause, because we are keen to vote on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to clear up this matter. As the hon. Member for Workington says, at present the milk marketing board is preparing a scheme for the transitional period. All of us have an interest in its success. We want reasonable proposals to be made. A statement of trading practices will have to given and we shall have to judge whether it is reasonable. If things happen on the way to the forum, as it were, we would be acting—I was going to say in loco parentis, but that is not quite the phrase; I was thinking of a French phrase for it—"as a good parent" in advising the board that, quite frankly, it should think again. We should not create a great constitutional jamboree about that. We are necessarily in constant contact. We therefore gave such advice. It was very sensible advice and it had an immediate effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has just said that everybody has an interest in Milk Marque succeeding. Let us have no illusions about this; some people do not have an interest in Milk Marque succeeding.

That is an argument for a careful definition, so that there is no doubt about the circumstances in which Milk Marque might be brought to account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to clear up this matter. I cannot speak for the Director General of Fair Trading, nor can I

	<span class='label label-info column'>291</span>
fetter his ability to act. I cannot say that he intends on day 1 to refer a certain sign-up rate, or that he does not so intend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He might be doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether he is considering it. He has the power to do so and the power not to do so. It is equally true that the Secretary of State could, to use the terminology of the hon. Gentleman, suggest a referral. That does not mean that he would, or that he would not. We should like the successor organisations to the milk marketing board to be launched, otherwise, we should not have gone to the trouble of discussing the matter in Brussels. Brussels has said, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West mentioned, that it will not initiate action for a two-year quarantine period. If others ask it to act, it has not guaranteed that it would not. It has not promised to keep its hands off, it has said that it will not initiate such action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept my hon. Friend's amendment. It is unnecessary and duplicates existing provisions. The competition authorities will have responsibility for monitoring the trading practices of a successor body, or bodies. We do not need parallel arrangements for reporting to agricultural Ministers. The OFT is there for that purpose. The amendment would require the monitoring of and reporting on a successor body's trading activities, but it does not say what Ministers should do on receipt of those reports. I appreciate that my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West is once again underlining concern about competition. Although I cannot accept his amendment, I appreciate the points that he has made, and the concern that has been expressed. I responded to those points earlier in the debate. I hope that he will accept this further expression of understanding that this issue is the key to and lies at the heart of our discussions. The milk marketing board will be foolish if it does not hearken to that discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should be amended to allow producer groups other than the milk marketing board to propose bodies to which assets can be transferred. In a move towards a freer market, it is essential that producers should be permitted full participation in the determination of their future. If producer groups are not given the right, by statute, to propose successor bodies to which a share of the board's wealth can be transferred, there can be no guarantee that their interests will be adequately represented by the MMB in preparing a scheme of reorganisation, or by the Minister when he considers the MMB's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earl Howe recognised, in introducing the Bill, that producers will wish to sell direct and to form local groups. They should be offered an equal right to suggest suitable recipients of a share of the board's wealth—which is not inconsiderable—to enable them to set up and market effectively from the first day following termination of the scheme, rather than be forced to rely on private finance or grants.

I return to my friends, the Red Rose farmers in Lancashire. There was an article about them recently in 	<i>Farmers Weekly.</i> Why should they not be given a proportion of the board's assets—they have worked hard to help to build them up over the years—to enable them to set up an enterprise? Why should the non-joiners have to finance the development of Milk Marque?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that my hon. Friend the Minister recognised that problem. In a statement on 22 April he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… the Board should not seek to retain assets because that would create an unreasonable and unfair incentive to producers to sign up with Milk Marque rather than one of the other groups."</p></blockquote>
I believe that my hon. Friend has an open mind on the subject, as he further stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"no decisions have yet been taken on apportionment of assets".</p></blockquote>
I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that the inclusion of the new clause in the Bill will go some way towards solving that dilemma.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again my hon. Friend is probing an important subject.

I understand that discussions with Brussels have moved a stage further. Although I am not able to say what the possible solution might be, I understand that a formula that would satisfy my hon. Friend appears to be on the cards. I hope that he will not press me further on that matter, because I am not able to go further. We have taken an interest in the matter, following the concern expressed by the Committee. The board understood those concerns. We shall find, when we judge the scheme, that provision has been made for my hon. Friend's concerns. In the light of that statement, I hope that he will not feel the need to press the new clause to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that this short new clause finds favour with the Committee because it is much sought after by the British Wool Marketing Board. Members of the Committee will realise that once the wool guarantee is ended the success or failure of the British Wool Marketing Board will depend solely on its ability to price wool properly and find a market for it. In the brave new world it will find itself in, it will need to adopt a more aggressive and professional approach in order to find and develop a market for British wool. To do that, the board may require specialist assistance on the board—for example, accountants and marketing men.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty lies in the existing structure of the board. As the board members—who are, by and large, elected—are protected by the guarantee, should the board get into financial trouble, the Government—or the state—will pick up the tab. Once the guarantee has been abolished, should there be a disaster—I am sure there will not be one—the individual members of the board would be liable for the losses incurred. The British Wool Marketing Board believes that that will be an enormous disincentive for people to join the board as experts. There would be a Lloyds situation, as board members would be personally liable for very large sums of money. The new clause proposes bringing the board into line with the Companies Act 1985, so that individual members of the board would have the same protection as directors of limited companies. The clause would help the board immeasurably and give it a good future after the guarantee has gone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"() In respect of a scheme submitted by the Milk Marketing Board of England and Wales the scheme must provide for the transfer at least six months before vesting day of all shares in Dairy Crest Ltd.
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
to persons who are or have been registered producers, such shares to be tradeable from the date of transfer.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would secure the transfer of shares in Dairy Crest Ltd. before vesting day to ensure that producers were not induced to join a milk marketing board successor for fear of not obtaining an interest in Dairy Crest, which represents 80 per cent. of the board's asset value. If producers have share certificates in their possession before vesting day, there will be no restraint, real or imaginary, on their decisions on whom to supply with milk. The Dairy Trade Federation is behind the amendment, and it suggests that the shares should be available six months before vesting day. The time scale could be adjusted—I believe that six months is quite a long time—and Ministers might at least take the principle on board and reply accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the arrangements need to be in place as soon as possible and that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can clarify the position.

Gentleman press it to a Division. However, if that is the outcome, we shall be relieved of the problem in any event.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement to transfer shares six months in advance of vesting day would delay vesting. The arrangements for the transfer of shares would probably take several months. Preparation for the distribution of Dairy Crest shares to producers could happen in parallel with other preparations, which clearly would not be the position if the amendment were to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All boards intend that vesting day should be 1 April 1994. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman would like to see that happen simultaneously because of the worries expressed about the possible dislocation of the market in Dairy Crest shares. The amendment would require shares to be transferred by 1 October 1993, and approval of the reorganisation scheme before 1 October is, frankly, not a realistic one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill should not specify a particular solution. Of course, we should not take it as certain at this stage that the board will propose a single successor co-operative and the separation of Dairy Crest. We want to leave it open to the board to have conversion and to suggest that there should be vertically integrated regional co-operatives. In other words, I do not want to pre-empt the board's choice as the amendment would do. Although I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concerns as well as those of the Dairy

	<p>Government amendments Nos. 254 to 257.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 47(2) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 places tight restrictions on the disclosure by a milk marketing board of information that it has acquired through the operation of its milk marketing scheme. Such information may be disclosed only if disclosure is required or authorised by the scheme for the purpose of legal proceedings under the 1958 Act or required by animal health legislation. We do not want that restriction to prevent beneficial transfers of information on reorganisation, such as the passing of names and addresses of producers to a development council, or the transfer of information about an asset to its recipient under the reorganisation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 19 of schedule 2 therefore sets aside the restrictions in section 47(2) of the 1958 Act in certain circumstances. The current provision would allow the transfer of information to anyone for the purposes of a reorganisation scheme. I recognise the industry's concern that that could offer a carte blanche to the board to pass confidential information to competitors of the successor body. The amendment will place strict controls on the transfer of information and intellectual property under reorganisation schemes. The board would have to specify in its reorganisation scheme what restricted information it proposed to disclose and to whom. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would consider that when deciding whether to approve a scheme. It would, therefore, be illegal for the board to disclose information
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
other than as specified in its approval scheme. In other words, the amendment tightens up those provisions regarding information. I hope that it will satisfy the concerns of Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have discussed the situation if one co-operative were to get the lion's share of the business. I wish to take that further and to obtain more reassurances from my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule should be amended to restrict the activities of any successor to a milk board while it controls 40 per cent. or more of the raw milk market in the board's former area of operation because that would probably put it in a dominant position. In that circumstance, it would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
be in appropriate for such a successor to process milk because it might grant itself preferential supply treatment, possibly to the detriment of potential competitors. It could use such facilities to persuade competitors to pay higher prices than they would normally pay for the supply of milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is against the background of the controversy surrounding the link between Dairy Crest and the milk marketing board that I propose the amendment. The amendment would give rise to a regulator. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food does not want a regulator of milk, but, in my view, such a role would be important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stole the Opposition amendment from the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West because it was especially good. We have amended it by, first, increasing the percentage and, secondly, by giving the Secretary of State the power to intervene to prevent such a situation occurring if he saw fit. In other words, we softened the effect of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments that I have tabled set out very reasonable proposals. They would not automatically trigger a cessation of activities by Milk Marque, but would give the Secretary of State the power to decide whether he thought it was in the public interest—the same words that were used earlier today about potatoes—for it to process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to recite all the material that I used in a debate on a previous amendment when I dealt with the rules of Milk Marque which were published by the Federation of Agricultural Co-operatives Ltd. Hon. Members might recall that I covered those rules in depth to prove that it might be—indeed, I believe that is—the intention of Milk Marque, at some time in the future, to involve itself in processing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should not shake his head. He cannot know who will be running Milk Marque in two, three, four, five or ten years time. It might have a completely different agenda, and one which I believe is set out in the rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go through the amendments so that Conservative Members can understand what we are trying to do. Amendment No. 139 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be a requirement of a qualifying scheme of re-organisation that unless the Secretary of State otherwise authorises"—</p></blockquote>
in other words, the Secretary of State would have the power to decide and, after the Cabinet reshuffle, that might be the Minister—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the constitution or proposed constitution of any qualifying successor body shall provide that it shall not engage in the processing of liquid milk or the manufacture of dairy products for any period during which it purchases"—</p></blockquote>
which could be 45 per cent., 50 per cent. or 55 per cent., according to which amendment one reads—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the milk produced in the area in which the Board to which it is a successor body exercised an exclusive right of purchase."</p></blockquote>
Those are reasonable amendments. We are not imposing a trigger. We would give Ministers the right to decide. We recognise that we might have to deal with a monopoly position. As the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West said, milk might may be directed towards processing plants away from others whose activities might be prejudiced. The Minister should consider my amendments favourably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of my amendments is not to stop Milk Marque from going into processing but to give Ministers the power to stop Milk Marque from going into processing if they believe that that is in the public interest.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I remind the Committee that, apart from Latin, the patois of Committees in the House of Commons is English, except when Black Rod visits the Chamber, when he is allowed to use ancient Norman.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Translated into English the phrase means to act as a good father would act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is much clearer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact is that under the new arrangements we are asking that the competition authorities—with Ministers using the competency that will remain with them and the ability to make recommendations—should act rather than having the honour thrust upon them. I understand the concern of the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend, but we would not have gone to the trouble of making it clear that Dairy Crest cannot remain part of the successor body if we intended to allow it to creep back into processing later. It is difficult to conceive circumstances in which competition authorities, especially if Milk Marque receives the sort of sign-up which some hon. Members believe is possible, would look indifferently upon that, and it is not necessary to specify that in the Bill. The constitution of Milk Marque is off the peg—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reliably informed that the constitution was specifically amended to cover the future responsibilities of Milk Marque, so it is not off the peg. What peg in a model document on the constitution of an organisation would cover the processing of milk? That cannot be a model peg. The constitution was drawn up specifically for the industry. The Minister is completely wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Gentleman that our understanding is that no particular significance should be read into the formulation of the constitution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Minister say that no significance should be read into the constitution? Those who run Milk Marque next year, or who are organising it from within the milk marketing board now, may believe that there is no significance, but it could be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
used in the future by people with different objectives. How can the Minister give such an undertaking to the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me approach the matter from a different direction and leave aside the argument about the significance of the constitution. We can both seek clarification of the intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The organisation, it has been said, may collect an 80 per cent. sign-up of dairy producers—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They say!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been said that the organisation will have to incorporate in its provisions mechanisms by which producers may leave. It cannot lock them in once it has got them. Provisions will exist for them to sign out after they have signed up. That will be an indispensable part of any scheme that is presented to us. For the sake of argument, even if erosion takes place, the board's successor will have a significant sign-up rate. Given that fact, and supposing that there is not a referral—my statement is neutral—the rate of sign-up would mean that the board's successor would not be so foolish as to march back to processing. That would inevitably invite some form of referral.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister assure us that when he approves schemes, he will seek a statement that Milk Marque will not enter into processing when the level of the market is so secure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I can give that assurance, in the terms that the hon. Gentleman requested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then how can we have it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If you were running Milk Marque, Mr. Cook, what conclusions would you draw? After such a long debate in Committee and the rest of the proceedings on the Bill in the House, you would know that people would be allergic to your board embarking on major processing activities. I do not believe that that is a risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The significant word is "major".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew that the hon. Gentleman would pick on that adjective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I can approach the problem in a different way? The Minister and I agree that the commercial, competitive element of the system is important, not the precise percentage. There could be circumstances in which a successor body had a considerable position in the market, but where 39.999 per cent. constituted the overall figure. The triggers set out in the amendments are, therefore, inappropriate. The commercial behaviour of the successor body should constitute the trigger. If that behaviour proves to be anti-competitive the Minister is right to say that a framework exists to deal with it. The triggers that the hon. Members for Gloucestershire, West and for Workington wish to impose are artificial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
There could be circumstances in which another dominant company provided processing in a specific area. For competitive reasons, we would not wish to pre-empt Milk Marque from entering that market in a small way, such as producing UHT milk. We should seek to free, not strangle the market. A straitjacket would damage competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has put it amirably and I am grateful to him for his precision. Amendment No. 79 would prevent the Secretary of State for Scotland from accepting current proposals from the Aberdeen and District milk marketing board and the North of Scotland milk marketing board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are unnecessary. The board must present its reorganisation scheme, which we will examine carefully. It will be launched in a marketplace where people—not least the competition authorities, who have a duty to watch the organisation—will look at it with eagle eyes. The board will be conscious of its responsibility to ensure that its own business is not subject to the necessary uncertainty of referral.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marland</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was flattered by what the hon. Member for Workington said about filching my amendment. He believes that he has improved on it. However, to leave out the power for the Secretary of State for Scotland to intervene was obviously a very serious omission. However, I stress that the amendment is not aimed solely at Milk Marque. It could apply to any company in the processing business that got the lion's share of milk processing in its area. It is wrong for the Committee to concentrate on Milk Marque. However, in view of the Minister's comments, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<li>Sub-paragraph (1) above applies to information the disclosure of which is (apart from paragraph 19 of Schedule 2 to this Act) restricted by section 47(2) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958.".—[	<i>Mr. Curry.</i>]</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the First schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is perhaps appropriate, as we approach the twilight of the Committee's work, for the Committee to turn to pensions. We have discussed that subject previously, but schedule 1 deals with the scheme of reorganisation—the disposition of rights and liabilities, the transfer of the board's undertakings, the rights of existing participants, and so on. Pensioners are worried about those matters, and about the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his letter dated 10 May, which focuses on pension surpluses. It notes that that is a complicated and complex matter, on which much more work needs to be done. I draw the Committee's attention to the following sentence:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Trustees of a pension scheme have a duty to act in the best interests of all the members, both current employees and those who have retired."</p></blockquote>
I have my doubts as to whether that is a statement of law, but if it is there is a strong argument that any surpluses in pension funds should be directed towards the best interests of both present and future pensioners. That means that surpluses should be used entirely to enhance the benefits of the pension scheme. A group of pensioners—it is no longer called an action group; they are concerned individuals—is seeking assurances on that matter from the milk marketing board. In their correspondence with the board, the pensioners have made it clear that they would like to be consulted. Consultation has been discussed already in Committee, but those pensioners want to ensure that the necessary funding arrangements remain secure. They want their annual review, which is linked to inflation, to continue. They are keen that their present benefits should be maintained and, if possible, improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recently, the chairman of the pension trust wrote to pensioners, describing the work that is under way and making clear his intention to resolve the matter. However, there is a fear that the chairman may be making haste too quickly. The matter will be discussed again on 18 May, but because of the many difficulties and complexities, I hope that the trust fund will not come to firm conclusions at that stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working group examining the matter has a pensioner among its members. Pensioners are keen to stress that although this person may be well qualified, and doing his best, he is not a representative of pensioners as a group but expresses his own views. Pensioners wish to be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland of our debate, in which he said that the Government were
	<br><blockquote><p>"prepared to table an amendment in the Committee as soon as possible to clarify the position of pensioners."—[	<i>Official Report Standing Committee F,</i> 22 April 1993; c. 103.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister emphasised that he did not wish to leave pensioners feeling forgotten and uncertain. I understand that work has begun on this matter. I should be grateful for further assurances about consultation and about the right of present and future pensioners to be consulted on any reorganisation scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) mentioned a letter sent by the Minister of State to members of the Committee on 10 May. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"During the session of the Committee on 27 April, I undertook to clarify the position with regard to the ownership of pension fund surpluses."</p></blockquote>
It continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The ownership of a pension scheme surplus is not a straightforward matter."</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 3 states that the question of ownership
	<br><blockquote><p>"is … being examined by the Pension Law Review Committee, under the Chairmanship of Professor Goode."</p></blockquote>
It states that the chairman of the England and Wales milk marketing board wrote to all board pensioners and referred to the board's active consideration of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the future of the Board's pension arrangements."</p></blockquote>
The letter begins by reminding us that the Minister promised to clarify the position of ownership of pension fund surpluses but he proceeded to do everything but that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
Will the Minister confirm that a pension fund surplus is the property of the employer? Will he also assure the Committee that surpluses in a fund will—bearing in mind that disposition of property rights and liabilities is provided for in schedule 1—be dealt with solely and exclusively in the interests of pensioners? It occurs to me that a surplus, being the exclusive property of the employer, could be used for another purpose outside the ambit of pensioners' interests. We need confirmation from the Minister that pensioners alone will benefit from the disposition of surpluses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am feeling benevolent this afternoon. I have been helpful to the Minister once, and I shall try to be helpful again. The issues being discussed were referred to in columns 123 and 124 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> on 27 April, the fourth sitting of the Committee. The Minister needs to think this matter through more carefully than his letter of 10 May suggests he has done. If a pensioners' action group, formal or otherwise, were to begin litigation at this stage, as happened with the Plessey Pension Fund 	<i>v.</i> GEC, such action would be not only extremely costly but time-consuming. It would also run counter to what the Government claim is their intention with the Bill insofar as it affects milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill states that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"provides for the ending of the milk marketing schemes in England and Wales and Scotland and the facilitation of the transfer of the milk marketing boards' property, rights and liabilities."</p></blockquote>
The Minister is right when he says in his letter certain matters are for the courts to decide. He is right also to refer to Professor Goode's inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, I sought leave to bring in a private Member's Bill on occupational pensions. I corresponded with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Maidstone (Miss Widdecombe), and discussed precisely these points. What happens when members of a pension fund are subject to a transfer in which they have had no part? I would gladly give way to any member of the Committee who disagrees with the principle that, although it can be argued in law that an employer has taken part of the risk associated with the development of a pension fund and so should be entitled to part of the surplus, in the context of a takeover the new employer has taken none of the risk and so is not morally entitled to one penny piece of the surplus fund. That is the simple point, and I doubt whether anyone in the House, let alone the Committee, would challenge the moral of the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was one of the aspects of the Bill that I sought leave to introduce. The Under-Secretary of State for Social Security wrote to me on 9 December as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I recognise and sympathise with the focus of your Bill to protect the rights of members of occupational pension schemes where a company undergoes a change of ownership."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Lady said that these matters are being considered by Professor Goode. So it is not in the Committee's power to change the law. It seems that everything is subject to Professor Goode's report, which is due to be published on or about 30 September. However, the Minister can give more than a crumb of comfort to pension fund members—whether they be active or retired members—in his response and in his handling of this matter on Third Reading by making it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
abundantly clear than the Government will not approve of any use of the funds other than for the benefit of fund members. I am not inviting the Minister to pre-empt Professor Goode or to say anything that his colleague in the Department of Social Security has not already said. It is merely an opportunity for him to facilitate the Bill's smooth passage with the support of those who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood said, are understandably concerned, as we all would be in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to consider the matter and give fund members the message loud and clear, either here and now—with, I suspect, the unanimous support of the Committee—or on Third Reading that he would not approve a scheme that failed to meet that important commitment and that the Government would not be party to an attempt to cream off any surpluses to the Exchequer's benefit. That point is simple, clear-cut and unambiguous; it is not a matter of contention. It does not seek to change the law. I note that no hon. Member has challenged the morality of my point and I assume, therefore, that it commands widespread support in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has invited me to comment on the matter on Third Reading. It is a complex, technical matter in which I have no expertise. I did my best to clarify the point to help hon. Members, but I am willing to reconsider the issue in the light of what has been said. On Third Reading, I may say anything that I legitimately can say that might be helpful. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that and ask the Minister to note—perhaps I am tempting fate—that none of his hon. Friends challenged my moral stance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman said conveys a widespread sentiment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely helpful.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 195, in page 31, line 35, leave out "successor".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to consider the remaining amendments to schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendments deal with details of property transfers from the board and taxation. Any amendments that do not cover those two points are purely technical, drafting amendments. The amendments on property transfers ensure that third parties cannot block transfers and that if their rights are diminished they get compensation—for example, leasehold property that is owned by the board, and transfers that might go partly to Milk Marque and partly to Dairy Crest. In such circumstances, it might be said that a landlord's beneficial interest might be diminished by having two people succeeding rather than a single person. The landlord would then have a claim for compensation. The aim is tax neutrality—the avoidance of charges arising solely as a result of the reorganisation scheme.

I do not want to go over old ground, but I understand that the hon. Member for North Cornwall moved an earlier amendment which, to an extent, is linked with these matters, but I cannot gather why because I had to leave the Room during part of the debate. Section 2(1) of the Agriculture Act 1947 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As at such date in each year as the Ministers may determine, they shall review the general economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry."</p></blockquote>
I understand that that responsibility will be deleted by the inclusion of schedule 5 in the Bill and that my probing amendment would restore it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know whether we can be given an undertaking that the document, which I am told arises out of the review or has a linkage with it, will be published every year in future and that nothing in the Bill will undermine its future. Perhaps the Minister can explain the link between the document and the review because we had difficulty in trying to establish the position this morning. If I can be given that assurance, I need say no more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance that he seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps I am nit-picking but I want to make sure that I have understood correctly. The document includes a number of tables and includes each sector of the industry. It will be published in its present form, including the sort of material that it now contains on the same voluminous basis, if that is the proper term to use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If we have that information, it should be public property because, goodness knows, much effort has gone into providing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have virtually completed consideration of the Bill in Committee, but before our proceedings are brought to a close I should like to thank you, Mr. Cook, and Mr. Hill, the other Chairman, for the extremely tolerant and humorous way in which you have chaired the debate upon this complicated Bill.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. May I join the Minister in expressing my gratitude to you, and to Mr. Hill, for chairing our Committee? I understand that you are a new member of the Chairmen's Panel, having joined it last year at the start of this Parliament. I think that this is one of the few Bills that you have had the opportunity to chair so far, so it has been a special pleasure for us. As time goes by, people who, unlike me, do not already know you well will learn that you have a tremendous sense of humour and that you will be one of the few Chairmen who is able to deploy such humour in Committee. It is a pity that we did not have more of your company during this Committee's deliberations. On behalf of my hon. Friends, may I say that it has been a pleasure. May I equally thank the Clerk, whom we lost for a short period and were worried about. We sent messages, and we are all glad to see him here today to thank him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. I regret detaining you for a minute, but I should like to associate myself warmly with the thanks offered by the Minister and the hon. Member for Workington to you and your joint Chairman. I wonder whether it is a coincidence that your names are so appropriate for the discussion of food and farming—the farming of the hills and the cooking of food. The way in which you have steered our proceedings shows that you are both alert to the interests of the industry. I hope that the industry has been encouraged by the Committee's cross-party discussion, real dialogue and debate about the important issues with which we have been concerned. The Committee has been a model of what parliamentary proceedings should be. We are grateful to you, Mr. Cook, and to your colleagues at your Table, for making it all the more effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for those points of order, and I shall convey the Commttee's sentiments to my colleague, Mr. Hill. I must point out that it is not the

culinary aspects of the cook that have been useful, but bearing in mind the steering to which the hon. Gentleman referred, Cook's navigation. I suppose that the covering of old ground was appropriate in an agriculture Bill, as was the gathering of udder points of view. I hesitate to break Standing Orders by using a foreign language, but I have been reminded of the Spanish axion, the motto of

the matador—un punto acqui un punto aya y en medio muchissimo torro, which means a point here, a point there, and in between an awful lot of bull.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
