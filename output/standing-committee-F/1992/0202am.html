I wish to correct a statement that was made at our previous sitting. Conservative Members implied that my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) was against the introduction of a statutory minimum wage. My hon. Friend referred me to a book that he wrote entitled "The Minimum Wage: Its Potential and Dangers", in which he favours the introduction of a minimum wage. He said, however, that it had to be phased in to avoid detrimental employment effects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>CONSTITUTION OF INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNALS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 237, in page 44, line 9, leave out "shall" and insert "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is to allow industrial tribunal chairs to sit alone, albeit in fairly selective cases, which include the rights on an employer's insolvency, Wages Act 1986 claims, and breach of contract claims under the extended jurisdiction of industrial tribunals in clause 31, which I think we shall support. They also include those concerning application for interim relief when a complaint has been made that the employee was dismissed on trade union grounds and, most important, those cases in which both parties supposedly agree to the tribunal chair sitting alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have said that part of the reason for the clause is the delay in claims being heard by industrial tribunals. I think that the reason that they gave is probably true—for a change. The delays are getting out of hand. The number of cases to be heard by industrial tribunals has increased greatly, as has the time that individuals must wait before the hearing takes place. In 1989–90, there were 32,913 cases; in 1990–91, that number increased to 35,926 cases. The delays will worsen because of the increased jurisdiction relating to trade union discipline under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time that cases have to wait to be heard has risen significantly with regard to Wages Act and redundancy payment applications. It rose in 1991 by 28 per cent. and 31 per cent. respectively. I understand that the 1992 figures will continue to increase. The waiting time for applications to be heard varies in certain regions. In the London north region, only 25 per cent. of its cases are heard within 12 weeks, while in Leeds 50 per cent. of cases
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
are heard within 12 weeks. However, no region had more than 50 per cent. of its case load heard within 12 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the problem stems from the Government's parsimonious attitude towards the funding of industrial tribunals. They asked full-time chairmen to become part-time chairmen and they cut the money available to them. That policy was based on the incredible assumption that fewer cases would come before industrial tribunals. Clearly, that did not happen, and in 1991 the then Secretary of State for Employment increased the industrial tribunal budget by £500,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government were still faced with the question as to whether tribunal chairs should sit alone. The matter was considered by the Prime Minister's efficiency unit, which concluded that savings might accrue from tribunal chairs sitting alone. The idea was not only to deal speedily with cases but to save money, which was the wrong basis for considering the matter. However, the unit cautioned against any hasty decision to implement the proposal. Part of its argument stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The tripartite nature of industrial Tribunals (and the EAT)"—</p></blockquote>
the employment appeal tribunal—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is central to their existence, and partly explains the extent of public confidence in them. Furthermore, Tribunal hearings can be tense, and a Chairman sitting alone might feel physically vulnerable. Some people do nonetheless argue that some cases could be decided by a full-time Chairman sitting alone. There are differing views amongst those supporting this change. Some argued that there were certain jurisdictions and types of case where this would be appropriate, for example Wages Act and other common law issues, uncontested hearings, and so on. Others argued that since each case differed, the decision would need to be made for each case by a full-time Chairman, or perhaps a Regional Chairman. Such a major change would require public consultation".</p></blockquote>
That came from the Prime Minister's efficiency unit, but I also cite a case heard by an employment appeal tribunal—East Berkshire health authority 	<i>v.</i> Matadeen—because it relates to the issue of a chairman sitting alone. The reason for a meeting between the chairman and representatives of an employee and an employer is that the cases which they hear are not solely concerned with matters of pure legality. In other words, it is the job of two members of the tribunal to know about the everyday running of a business from both sides, to be aware of its inherent stresses and strains and to take those factors into consideration. They do not deal merely with arcane arguments about legal niceties, as was made clear by the chairman of that employment appeal tribunal, who stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parliament has constituted an Appeal Tribunal on which laymen skilled and experienced in industrial relations and practices are in a majority and sit not as assessors but as full members. The presiding High Court judge can be, and on occasions has been, out-voted on a decision. The function of the industrial members is not only to give advice to the judge on numerous matters and aspects of the industrial relations, but to bring their experience and industrial judgment to the application of the law and to the decision to be reached on appeal. If the EAT is required to examine each appeal in the context of the Temple or Chancery Lane, then the industrial members can see little point in their sitting. As they understand the position, it is because the strictest application of the law must at times be tempered that Parliament ordained that they should be full members of this court."</p></blockquote>
That neatly states the case for having industrial members of the tribunal. People who take their cases to industrial tribunals have confidence in them because they act quite speedily, are relatively cheap and are far better than small claims courts. The average sitting of an industrial tribunal is four hours, while a small claims court
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0711">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
sits for days. The tribunal has members with expertise in both legal matters and industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, we want to ensure that industrial tribunals always sit not only with a chairman but with two industrial members, who can give their aid and advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Gailbraith) said, the clause provides extra flexibility to ensure that cases are dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible. The hon. Gentleman accepts that there has been a huge increase in the number of cases brought to tribunals. I am sure that all members of the Committee are concerned about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industrial tribunals perform a highly valuable role in resolving disputes between individual employees and their employers. The case load is now at an unprecedented level and has virtually doubled over the past few years. Inevitably that has meant that hearings have been delayed longer than usual or than is desirable in a system that was intended to provide an inexpensive and speedy remedy in employment disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, industrial tribunal chairmen may sit alone to determine some procedural matters and certain applications for interim relief. Apart from that, a tribunal can hear a case only if it comprises a legally qualified chairman and two lay members, or one lay member if the parties agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that chairmen shall sit alone when hearing the proceedings listed in new subsection (2C) unless, having taken account of the matters in new subsection (2E), they decide that a three-person tribunal should hear the case, in the light of the considerations set out in the new subsection (2E).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment appears to change the emphasis so that the chariman would have discretion not to sit alone, even when it was abundantly clear that that would be appropriate. In the cases listed in new subsection (2C) there is often little role for the practical experience of employee relations that lay members can provide. A case may turn wholly in a legal matter, for example, with the facts already clear and agreed by the parties. In such cases it may be unnecessary and wasteful for lay members to sit alongside the tribunal chairman. It may cause additional delay in arranging a date for the hearing when all the tribunal members, and the parties and witnesses, can be present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is flexibility even in the specified cases. The chairman can decide at any time to sit with lay members if, having taken account of various matters set out in new subsection (2E), he or she decides to do so. That means that if a chairman orginally decides that a case should be heard sitting alone, he can change his mind later if the circumstances make that appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden that that is an important safeguard. It is an important safeguard also for the parties appearing before the chairman because they have the right of appeal to go beyond the tribunal if they believe that the chairman has not considered the matter correctly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, lay members of industrial tribunals make an important contribution because of their practical
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
knowledge of employee relations in the workplace, in particular about workplace practices and what most employers and employees would consider reasonable behaviour in particular situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not want the Committee to gain the impression that we expect large numbers of cases to be heard under the new procedures. The experience of lay members is valued and will continue to contribute, wherever it can be useful. The vast majority of cases—in particular those concerning unfair dismissal and those raising discrimination issues—will be unaffected by the new provisions. However, the proposed discretion will permit a more efficient use of resources in the minority of cases to which it will apply, and will help to reduce delays at industrial tribunals, as we all want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that it will normally be more appropriate for a chairman alone to deal with the proceedings set out in the clause. As I have explained, even in those cases there will be discretion for chairmen to decide that a case should be heard by a tribunal of three, either from the outset or as the case develops. Our proposals contain important safeguards and I hope that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not rise before, Mr. Knox, because I hoped that the Minister would set out examples of cases in which he envisaged the chairman sitting alone. The wording of the clause concerns me, not just as someone who has represented a number of employees over the years but because my views are shared by employers and employers' organisations. The lack of certainty created by the clause gives rise to worries about the confidence that people will have in the industrial tribunal process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the growth in industrial tribunal cases. He should be aware that that growth is a function of the changing face of industrial relations. I should have thought that the Minister would be pleased in principle that disputes are being resolved in quasi-legal frameworks rather than by the method adopted in years gone by—industrial action. Surely he would agree that the stop-gap of a quasi-legal process is extremely helpful to industrial relations. Confidence in the system is the key point in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I ask the Minister to be absolutely precise. We are not certain what is meant by the clause. Reference has been made earlier to Mr. Justice Wood and Mr. Justice Browne-Wilkinson concerning the increasingly legalistic nature of tribunals. The approach that has been adopted—leaving tribunals, in certain circumstances, in the sole care of a legally qualified chairman—flies in the face of the request of Mr. Justice Browne-Wilkinson and Mr. Justice Wood for a return to the principles upon which tribunals were set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much more common sense needs to be applied in such forums. During the first tribunal hearing that I attended in about 1976, a long debate took place over the definition of a "substantial" glass of whisky. I suspect that other members of the Committee are more qualified than anyone on that tribunal to decide that definition. Such matters do not require the chairmanship of a highly qualified barrister. Common sense ought to apply, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
needs to be returned to the industrial tribunal process. The removal of lay members risks turning tribunals into more formal legal structures in which only matters of law—as distinct from matters of common sense—will be debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the increasing cost of the system, due to the changing face of industrial relations and the increasing number of applications. He said that the fallback for those whose cases come only before a chairman will be their right of appeal. The total cost of the appeal mechanism not only to the state—the public purse—but to employers and employees as a result of having to engage barristers to represent them at the employment appeals tribunal will rise if the Minister's actions cause more cases to go to EAT. Those points need careful consideration. I can understand the Minister's wish to simplify the process. I can also understand his statement that where someone is formally withdrawing from a case, it is daft to have a full tribunal. My worries hinge on people's confidence in the system. If an applicant or respondent—I have witnessed examples of each—is invited by the chairman to proceed with one fewer member on the panel, that person is under great pressure to accede to the chairman's wishes. That is not in the interests of natural justice, nor does it promote the confidence that should be maintained in the system, which does work, albeit in a crude fashion sometimes and with considerable delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is determined, as are Opposition Members, to maintain a pattern of industrial relations that maximises the potential for the fewest possible industrial disputes, we must have proper mechanisms in place. The industrial tribunal mechanism is important. It should be given the fullest possible support and the maximum resources available to ensure that delays are reduced. The only way to reduce delays is to respond positively to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden about the cuts in the system that have been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against the background of what I hope the Minister will agree is a common-sense approach, as distinct from a partisan opinion, I urge him to think again about the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware from what I have already said during this and previous Committees that I regard the function of industrial tribunals as essential to the working of good industrial relations in a modern society. If we consider the unstructured chaos that typified industrial relations—especially the dismissal of individuals by companies—before the 1971 Act, which introduced unfair dismissal legislation, and compare that with the calm and tranquillity that has followed since, one can conclude only that industrial tribunals are a valuable, desirable and important improvement to the way in which we conduct our industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the heart of that reform is the fact that everyone has considerable confidence in the tribunal structure. That is because there is a legally qualified chairman and representatives from both sides of industry sitting with him to add to the common-sense approach. It is important that that confidence is not lost
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I recognise that there are problems with the system, which these clauses address. For example, in a
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
case that continues for several days, the three members of a tribunal will try to fix a date for the second day of the hearing, but, the second day of that hearing could take place weeks after the first. It is not good for any case that the first day of the hearing should be in one month and the second day a month later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, I understand the conflict in any new system of law between the need for speed, informality and fairness and the need for certainty. One of the great benefits of the industrial tribunal system is that it has forced employers to develop systems and codes that reflect good practice. In the early days of the legislation, employers feared the randomness of tribunal decisions. Companies could not make decisions and be certain of the consequences. They did not know whether the decisions would be found to be fair or unfair and what damages might be awarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was inevitable that, after a relatively short time, the areas of law that were most open to interpretation began to be interpreted. Furthermore the law, which is now relatively mature, is also inherently complex, because there is a series of interpretative judgments that enable everyone familiar with the law to be able to predict with reasonable certainty the outcome of particular cases. I accept that that makes it relatively difficult for the individual to turn up, unaided and unadvised, and have his complaint dealt with informally. That was what the tribunals were originally set up to do and that is traditional in law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember learning that equity was introduced precisely to remedy the artificiality and complexity of common law and that it was designed as a series of legal, decision-making processes that would introduce informality. Gradually it became even more complex than the common law that it was designed to supplement. There is a danger that industrial relations law could go down a similar route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The loose-leaf books that purport to describe industrial relations law today are bewilderingly complex. That is why the role of the chairman of an industrial tribunal is so important. While the tribunal appears superficially to be complex, when one is involved in its proceedings on a day-to-day basis one finds that the overwhelming majority of cases go down fairly well-defined routes. Many of these great issues oflaw are reasonably well determined. People ought to know—most good employers and large companies with personnel departments certainly know—the consequences of their actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State should try to find ways to streamline the tribunal system that do not shake people's confidence in tribunals. From time to time a difficult balance has to be struck. The Minister has given himself various powers for various circumstances. I do not object to him having those powers, but I need his reassurance that the way they work is kept under regular review. If a significant number of complaints seem to arise from the fact that the chairman is hearing cases alone, the Government must reconsider this matter. I do not want confidence in the structure of industrial tribunals to be undermined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that cases that last several days, to which he referred earlier in his speech, tend to start with a separate tribunal sitting that deals with particular points of law? One should not necessarily assume that the fact that a case might last a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
long time justifies having only the chairman sitting. The industrial relations complexities of many cases that have lasted for a long time mean that they are cases where it is probably the least desirable for the chairman to sit alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was certainly not my intention to imply that a case that may be going on for several days is automatically one that the chairman should hear on his own. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that those are cases where the facts are often most contested. They are often pre-eminently cases where a full tribunal is needed to hear those facts. The reason most cases carry on from one day to another, however, is that a tribunal lists a number of cases to be heard on one day. Therefore each case does not get a full day's hearing before a tribunal. Having started one's case, one may have to break off after, perhaps, only an hour or two. The same tribunal of three people will then come back to hear the rest of the case a month or so later. The issues might be relatively straightforward and confined to the limited areas that the amendment defines. A chairman on his own could hear that kind of case, but that should be a matter of judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend will be able to give an assurance that the situation will be kept under review and that the Government share my view of the overriding need for industrial tribunals to retain the confidence of all those who use them. If that confidence were to be eroded, we should return rapidly to the position in the 1960s and 1970s, when people regarded industrial action as the only option that was reasonably open to them. In the same circumstances, people now regard a tribunal as an acceptable alternative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Spellar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief because there is common ground between both sides of the Committee about the desirability of reducing the delays that have started to occur in industrial tribunals. Whether it is the mechanism for doing that is open to doubt, which is why we have tabled the amendment. Many of the responses that could reduce the delays are in the Government's hands. The delays, which can be for up to 12 or 18 months, did not happen overnight. The problem has been steadily creeping up. The solution is not especially legislative; it is substantially administrative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste) that one of the reasons for the delays has been the increasing legalisation of industrial practice. I understand some of his arguments about that. But, given that that has happened, it has been incumbent upon the Government to make additional provisions by, for example, appointing extra chairmen and lay members to deal expeditiously with the delays that were starting to build up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other concern is with the practice of parts of the Government or the public sector in contributing to the delays. The longest tribunal that I am aware of was that of a case between a Government-owned body, the Port of London authority, and 19 sacked shop stewards and branch officials at Tilbury docks who were members of the Transport and General Workers Union. Those people were sacked on 26 July 1989. After a delay, that action was followed by the longest industrial tribunal case, which
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
found that those people were unfairly dismissed for trade union activities and which ordered compensation and reinstatement. That tribunal has cost the various parties several million pounds. The response of the public body was not to accept the tribunal's decision, but to delay the process still further. It is now 1993—four years since the original action—and the Port of London authority is to appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must have some influence with a body of which they are the sole owner. To drag out the procedures demonstrates a lack of good will in dealing with industrial tribunals. The Government have to consider whether they are really trying to solve the problem, in terms of their role as the manager of industrial tribunals and the role of public bodies in those tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point that I wish to make is that I am slightly concerned about the pressure, mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller), that is put on the participants in industrial tribunals. He described the problem of having to tell a chairman that he is not trusted to deal with a case, which would not put him in the best mood. That is, of course, a chairman of a tribunal and not, Mr. Knox, the Chairman of the Committee. A twin track of justice would be created which effectively would ask litigants, "Do you want the quick, cheap and cheerful approach, or would you rather have the full-blown approach which might take 12 or 18 months?" It is unfair and improper to force that decision on either party to an industrial tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As always with industrial tribunals, there are clear-cut cases that could be cited, although we have not especially heard them today, such as that in which the applicant wishes to withdraw the application. But there will always be cases which are on the borderline and in which people have to make the difficult decision whether they want the case decided by people experienced in the ways of industry who will understand the practices of industrial relations and the nuances of industrial negotiations. If they want that, they may have to wait some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised when I heard the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston say that in the early days of industrial tribunals he and his colleagues would sit around mulling over a substantial glass of whisky, then conclude that barristers were not needed. It is a well-known fact that any barrister can recognise a substantial glass of whisky with tremendous ease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman declaring a vested interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but I could probably be an expert witness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the early days of industrial tribunals, the procedure was informal. We would attend with one book—"Hepple and O'Higgins on Industrial Relations." As time wore on, the complexities became obvious and the leading text on the subject grew from a slim, one-volume text, to four, thick volumes, which were regularly updated. The law became extremely complex. Through all the changes, the industrial jury—a tribunal chairman and two lay members—would have been present, using common sense to solve problems. It is vital that there be a sense of what industrial practice is from the view of both the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
employer and the employee. I agree that industrial tribunals are unique bodies with a unique ability to solve common-sense problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who practises in industrial tribunals, I have become concerned about the delays during the past two or three years. To give an example, I was in an industrial tribunal yesterday and the adjournment was for three months on a part-heard basis. To adjourn a case for three months is too long. In another recent case, a year passed between the date of dismissal and the hearing in the industrial tribunal. The Government must be right to try and address such problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am cautious about moving away from a tribunal that has two lay members and a chairman. That system has the confidence of both sides of industry. However, there are cases in which it is not essential for the industrial jury to deal with the problem. For example, when the Wages Act 1986 became law, several cases were brought forward on the basis that arrears of wages or notice moneys was a deduction from wages and that, therefore, claims could be made under the Wages Act that could previously be made only in the county court. That was a pure question of law. There were half-a-dozen leading cases on the subject, but in each case the chairman decided the case with his legal knowledge and there was no input from the lay members. In my view, there are cases in which lay members are unnecessary, but we must be cautious and monitor the impact of the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman draw the same parallel with the magistrates courts? Notwithstanding the legal qualifications of the flank members on the tribunal, is he saying there are circumstances in law in which it is expeditious for one person to deal with them, or is he really saying that the tribunal system is under-resourced?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In industrial tribunals, the chairman is the legal mind who decides on legal aspects in advising his colleagues. In the magistrates court, the clerk of the court gives legal advice. In neither instance do those people make the decision. As the hon. Gentleman knows, it is not unknown in a complex case in a magistrates court for a stipendiary magistrate to sit in for the reasons outlined by the hon. Gentleman, namely, that the case is a legal and complex issue and that it is beneficial for a stipendiary magistrate to decide the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considering the evolution of industrial tribunals and the decisions that chairmen are already making on their own, issues such as those of discovery, on further and better particulars and on interim issues, are matters on which the chairman is able to rule. That could be expanded without losing the confidence of both sides in industry or the unique quality of an industrial tribunal. The matter must be approached with caution, but I believe that we could go further now. I shall therefore support the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hutton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had two interesting contributions from Conservative members of the Committee. The hon. Member for Elmet spoke about the importance of industrial tribunals retaining the confidence of both sides of industry. That is, perhaps, the most important consideration and it is why the Opposition have reservations about the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald) said that industrial tribunals were industrial juries. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
intended to use that phrase, but he pinched it from me. That is an important concept for the Committee to bear in mind, because that is how industrial tribunals are seen and have been seen since they were set up. I would find it amazing if, even in the current climate, the Government tabled proposals to abolish the jury system in criminal trials on the basis that that would speed up the process of case law in the criminal courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition to the points made by the hon. Member for Elmet about confidence and by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North about the concept of juries, we must balance the pursuit of efficiency and the aim of reducing the waiting lists for cases due to come before industrial tribunals with broader considerations of the direction that we want industrial tribunals to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the hon. Member for Elmet ask the Minister to assure the Committee that he would keep the process under review. It would be easy for the Minister to give such an undertaking, as it means little. We must first establish whether the Government's proposal is the right thing to do to the industrial tribunal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North probably has more experience of industrial tribunals than any other member of the Committee. He said that it was now possible for chairmen sitting alone to deal with matters and that that often happens. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree, however, that those matters are mainly procedural and do not involve substantive issues oflaw. There has been some argument about the discovery of documents and information, which has generated substantive case law and argument in the courts—in the higher courts, in some cases—but it is generally accepted that those are procedural matters. From a legal and an industrial point of view, there would be no difficulty in all of us agreeing that that is the appropriate responsibility of the legally qualified chairmen of industrial tribunals. That does not separate the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should concentrate on the broader issue of whether it is right that the proceedings itemised in subsection (2C) should be taken away from the existing industrial jury and given into the sole preserve and prerogative of the legally qualified chair. The Opposition say that it is not right. It is important to remember that industrial tribunals are industrial juries. Just as most members of the Committee and of the House would not be persuaded of the logic of abolishing juries in criminal trials simply in the pursuit of efficiency, that argument should logically prevail in this context also.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A jury decides issues of fact; the judge decides issues of law. Why should not that be the case with industrial tribunals? If a pure issue of law is involved, why should not the chairman decide on his own, as a lawyer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that, whereas lawyers often make a firm distinction between points of law and points of fact, in many cases it is not as simple as that. For example, we shall later discuss extending the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals to include breach of contract claims. Any standard textbook says that it is a question of law whether conduct amounts to an intention no longer to be bound by the terms of a contract, but that rests on questions of fact about the conduct of the parties
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
and their interpretation of the clauses in the contract That hard and fast distinction between questions of law and of fact is not always easy to maintain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is a point of law whether a tribunal could realistically have reached its conclusions on the facts that were presented to it, so there is a blur. There is an important practical difference between jurors and lay members of tribunals. A jury is empanelled and will sit continuously until it has heard a case. In general, lay members of an industrial tribunal are busy people who are engaged in industry and they provide a relatively limited amount of their time to make the system work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that considerable injustice will result if evidence is given on the first day and all that is available of it are the handwritten notes of the chairman. Perhaps a month or more later, the weight of that evidence and the conviction of the witnesses may have been lost and evidence that is given later will carry greater weight. So there is a need for balance because people who give only limited amounts of their time cannot attend day after day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear the hon. Gentleman's comment, but it would not be desirable to empanel permanent lay members of a tribunal because the part-time nature of their role is important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman but if one takes his argument to a logical conclusion, I fear that we seem to be heading in the direction of doing away with lay members of industrial tribunals. I may have misconstrued his point, but I would not be in favour of having professional lay members of those tribunals and if the hon. Gentleman was flagging that as a problem, I concur with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to concentrate on the substantive issue of principle and ensure that when we vote on the clause we have not been blinded by arguments based on the pursuit of efficiency. We are discussing how we want cases resolved and principle is more important than that pursuit The argument that has been presented can easily be rebutted. If we are worried about the backlog of cases, why do not the Government empower industrial tribunals to sit more frequently? If there is delay, there is no reason why a full industrial tribunal cannot deal with the backlog. It is not necessarily logical to argue that, if there is a backlog, we must change the composition of the tribunals to allow them to deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Warley, West (Mr. Spellar) made a telling point. I have forgotten what he said but I recall that it was a telling point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the point was that those delays have not occurred suddenly but have been growing incrementally. The Government could have perceived that and could have provided facilities by increasing the number of chairmen and lay members of industrial tribunals to tackle the problem rather than trying to deal with the problem by their proposals in the Bill. In other words, the solution that was required was not legislative but administrative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend was able to jog my memory about the point that I was struggling to recall by saying that the problem is one of administration. It is not necessary to change the law relating to the composition of industrial tribunals to deal with an administrative backlog of delayed cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my hon. Friends and I are worried that we may be witnessing the beginning of a process that could undermine the presence of lay members of industrial tribunals. It is easy for the Government to say that we can remove those lay members in a limited number of cases and return later to inform the House that it has been a great success so it is logical to remove them in other cases as well. If that was the Government's wider ambition, it would be reprehensible. I am sure that the Minister will say that that is not their intention but we have seen similar developments in the past: an experiment is started, it is claimed to have been a success and the logic is to say that, as it has proved successful in a limited area, the technique can be used to deal with all sorts of other problems. That process can be used to justify the removal of lay members from industrial tribunals, so I hope that Conservative members of the Committee will have reservations about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he thought that a limited number of cases would be dealt with by the chair of an industrial tribunal on his or her own. Has the Minister made any assessments? I should be interested to know the basis for his saying that there will be only a few cases. Under subsection (2C), the power of a chair to sit on his or her own in an industrial tribunal will be extended to
	<br><blockquote><p>"proceedings in respect of which an industrial tribunal has jurisdiction under section 131".</p></blockquote>
That is the extended jurisdiction for an industrial tribunal to hear breach of contract cases. A substantial number of cases will fall into that category, so I was surprised that the Minister said that he did not expect chairs to sit excessively on their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another problem with the clause. A benefit of extending the jurisdiction, of which I am in favour, is to bring together in one forum common law claims for breach of contract and statutory claims for unfair dismissal. That makes a great deal of sense to lawyers and practitioners. It is frustrating for a case to be pursued simultaneously at a county court or High Court while the proceedings are being dealt with by an industrial tribunal. Most practitioners will be much more appreciative of a position in which claims can be heard in one forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I fear that by giving to the chair of an industrial tribunal the power to hear cases on his or her own, that might create a further administrative problem. As it is currently comprised, an industrial tribunal will hear an unfair dismissal case with the chair and two lay people. A breach of contract claim often runs alongside an unfair dismissal case. How will that be administered? Cases often occur of unclaimed wages, non-payment of notice money, non-payment of contractual benefits, and so on. The clause will result in the position when the full tribunal hears part of the case and, magically, the two lay people who were instrumental in making decisions are removed from the scene and the chair then hears the case on his own or her own. I cannot understand the logic of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the industrial tribunal, with the chair and two lay people, is hearing the full unfair dismissal case, surely it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0716">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
is logical for it to hear the breach of contract claim, too. In that context, it is unlikely that such a case would have been subject to a delay. Given that a combined breach of contract case and an unfair dismissal case would be heard by the industrial tribunal, what is the logic of a differently constituted industrial tribunal hearing the latter case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have several reservations about the clause. Our ambition—as I am sure is that of Conservative Members—is to ensure that the industrial tribunal system works efficiently and speedily and that the process is not subject to substantial delay. We support measures that would eliminate such delays. As my hon. Friend the Member for Warley, West made clear, the responsibility for delays in the system is largely of the Government's making. To resolve that problem, it would be unwise to damage the fundamental composition of the industrial tribunal system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pursuit of efficiency is a laudable objective, but it must not be pursued at the expense of wider principles. As the hon. Member for Elmet said, it is important to preserve the confidence that both sides of industry have in the present industrial tribunal system. If the Minister simply says that he will review the clause, that will be unlikely to satisfy Opposition Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Several matters have been raised that cause concern to members of the Committee. I can say categorically that we do not wish to undermine the confidence that has been expressed in industrial tribunals. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston was correct to say that, were the provision to lead to substantially more cases being heard by the appeals tribunal, that would be a false move. He also asked which cases would be dealt with. They are well set out in subsection (2C) and later we may debate the changes that could result from subsection (2D).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several of my hon. Friends have expert knowledge of the way in which the system works and my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet asked whether the Government would give an assurance that they would keep the matter under close review. Although the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) was rather dismissive of any Government pledge to keep any matter under review, I give my hon. Friend that assurance. I am as concerned as both he and my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North to ensure that the system of industrial tribunals is improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about delays and their causes, and other members of the Committee have expressed their concern about the issue today. To be told that a case that has been started will be delayed for three or four months before it moves to the next stage is an obvious cause of concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is not designed merely to improve efficiency and speed the progress of cases. Of course I hope that our proposal for chairmen to sit alone will result in greater efficiency, but we also want to help people who now wait a long time for industrial tribunals to deal with their cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some Opposition Members almost argued that the Government had allowed a huge number of cases to build up without trying to solve the problem, but I refute that. Since 1988 there has been an increase in 14 per cent. in the number of full-time chairmen, an increase of more than 50 per cent. in part-time chairmen and an increase of 45 per cent. in staff. The Lord Chancellor has agreed to extend, for a limited period, the number of occasions
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
on which a part-time chairman may sit from 50 to 70 days for those in practice, and from 70 to 100 days for those who are retired from practice. That represents substantial increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appointed a number of new lay members to industrial tribunals during the summer and I am pleased to announce that we have substantially increased the number of women who were appointed as lay members. It is clear that we have taken proper steps to try to reduce the time on waiting lists, but there are cases that turn on points of law and that are best determined by a person who is legally qualified. In those cases, we propose to give a new right for a chairman to sit alone. As the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness said, it is difficult to estimate the number of such cases and I said that there would be few of them. They represent only a small percentage of the total but I agree that a large number of cases are currently outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with an important matter. A chairman can decide at any stage that he would prefer lay members to be present because he will want to arrive at a correct decision. I do not believe that anyone is arguing that chairmen are not independent people or that they would find it acceptable to reach a wrong decision, but that will not happen. A chairman will always have the option of accepting the assistance of lay members if he so wishes and the ability to do so is an important proviso in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concerns expressed by Opposition Members about the issue, but the clause will help to reduce the backlog and improve the efficiency of industrial tribunals. I also hope that it will go some way to reducing the extended delays referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet when cases are deferred for a considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a high degree of agreement in the Committee about the way to move forward and the importance of the industrial tribunal system, so I hope that the clause will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some very learned speeches have been made, which have given those of us not involved in industrial tribunals an insight into their problems. We managed to spend an hour discussing whether to change "shall" to "may". Imagine the problems more detailed matters must cause. We discussed not only what the point of law was, but whether there was a point of law at all. That shows why industrial tribunals most not get bogged down in legalism but consider submissions from representatives of the employers and of the employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Minister's assurances—which will be welcomed by everyone—we are still concerned about industrial tribunal chairmen sitting alone. The amendment is technical. We originally tabled an amendment to delete that section, but it was ruled that that would mess up the rest of the clause. We had thought that to be the purpose of tabling amendments, but apparently it is not. Since it is a technical amendment, we shall not press it at this stage but shall return to the matter in the clause stand part debate. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tabled the amendment almost as a reflex action—as Opposition Members tend to do when it is proposed to give powers to the Secretary of State. It is a basic democratic argument that a Secretary of State ought not to take to himself or herself too many powers, irrespective of which party is in power, as such powers are handed on. If further powers are proposed, they ought to be approved by the house and the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been general agreement in Committee this morning that we need to do something about excessive delays with industrial tribunals. I shall return to that matter during the clause stand part debate. We have also agreed that the retention of confidence and trust in industrial tribunals is important. Members of the Committee such as the hon. Member for Elmet have said that powers should not be extended without due consideration. He used phrases such as "difficult to assess", "matters of judgment" and, most importantly, "keep the matter under review". That is indeed appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2C) provides for the loss of employees' fundamental right to negotiate industrial matters and employment rights. Before any arrangements are changed, that change should be discussed by the House. It should not be made by order of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State often has power to make consequential amendments to matters such as the level of fines, which depend on inflation. The clause would give the Secretary of State the power to alter individuals' rights in industrial matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That concerns hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. We want to ensure that any such changes are made only after an extensive review and after the Government have laid before the House not only the order but the reasons why they wish to extend it. Our amendment to ensure that the order is approved by both Houses of Parliament would, I am sure, be accepted by Conservative Members, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we basically acknowledge, the power for a chairman to hear cases without lay members is new. It is a significant change. Experience of operating such a system may show that additional types of cases could successfully be heard by the chairman sitting alone. It could also perhaps show that some of the cases listed in subsection (2C) are not suitable to be so heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would mean that an adjustment which, in the light of experience, proved to be desirable would have to await primary legislation. That could take considerable time and it would be an unnecessary delay. There is no hidden agenda. It is common sense to provide the power to make the changes if it were to become clear that they were desirable, without having to wait for a Bill to be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is fear that the Government will attempt to slip through some changes without proper scrutiny. That could not happen. The clause provides that
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
the proposal for varying the provisions will be subject to the negative resolution procedure. There would be the usual opportunity for a debate on any proposed changes. I acknowledge the strength of feeling about the matter, and I can accept amendment No. 230 in principle. However, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment, given that I undertake to table an amendment in due course to make the affirmative resolution procedure apply in those specific cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his assurances, and beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the Minister's generous concession, we are still worried about chairmen sitting alone. General agreement has been reached that industrial tribunals are subject to long delays. Something must be done about it. Opposition Members consider that the clause is not the way forward, as it will still infringe the rights of those individuals involved. We should be much happier if the Secretary of State introduced powers under which industrial tribunals were reviewed statutorily. We want performance targets to be set and assessments carried out about whether the cases are being heard within a proper time limit. When problems occur, we want them to be examined to find out whether they are caused by lack of money, whether more chairmen are required, or whether excessive legalism had been applied. Each industrial tribunal should be subject to an annual review and have its performance targets monitored, so that consideration can be given to correcting any deficiencies that might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, waiting times vary throughout the country. Delays are longer in south east London than they are, for example, in Leeds or Scotland. We must consider why the process is faster in Scotland. When such information is to hand, it can be applied to other areas. That process would increase the number of cases being heard and the rate at which they are heard, while at the same time not reducing the rights of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about what is not in the clause, too. It will withdraw certain rights from individuals, yet there is no quid pro quo. For example, industrial tribunals have the right to reinstate individuals, but employers do not have to comply with that right. We are surprised by that, because, if a trade union does not comply with industrial tribunal decisions or orders, it is subject to heavy penalties and fines. We wonder why trade unions must comply, but employers need not do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an employer complies with a reinstatement order, an employee may receive financial compensation, but that is no compensation for his job and full-term employment. That is a major omission from the clause. When dealing with industrial tribunals, the Government should have taken the opportunity to extend the rights of individuals. The Government always tell us that they are concerned about individuals' rights and their future in employment, so why have employees no right to reinstatement? Why do the Government concentrate on reducing employees'
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
right to a proper industrial tribunal on which lay members serve?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for his undertaking to table an amendment to introduce the affirmative resolution procedure. Despite his concession, however, we still oppose the clause and will vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To summarise the views expressed by members on both sides of the Committee, I refer to a letter from the Heating and Ventilating Contractors Association, which graphically illustrates some of the arguments. The Minister is, no doubt, familiar with that organisation, which represents many employers throughout the country. Some are small companies, but some are much larger. The association expresses its concerns about the clause, which I shall paraphrase for the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The letter says that lay members of industrial tribunals play an important role and refers to the issue of confidence that we have discussed. According to the association, lay members speak the language of both employer and employee. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Chairmen of Industrial Tribunals sitting alone will tend to concentrate on legalistic argumentation in a way that could be to the disadvantage of employer and employee alike.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The inevitable consequence of this proposed change will be that Industrial Tribunals will become even more formalised."</p></blockquote>
That is the point that I made. I am worried that many more cases could be referred to the employment appeal tribunal, at great expense to the public purse, as a result of the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point, which should be considered carefully, is that large employers will have little difficulty in engaging expensive counsel to act on their behalf. Smaller employers, who are perhaps more vulnerable than large employers because they do not have in-house personnel management expertise, would be disadvantaged by the proposal. Our debate this morning has, by and large, been non-partisan. The Minister should take that important point on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tribunal chairmen sitting on their own would be a disincentive to employees to represent themselves or to be represented by a lay officer or full-time officer of a union, as distinct from engaging lawyers. Although lucrative contracts might emanate from that for some firms of solicitors—possibly firms represented by Conservative members of the Committee—it is not in the best interests of industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the association points out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While the Bill does not at present envisage lone Chairmen for the general run of unfair dismissal, redundancy and discrimination cases, we fear that the proposed legislation could, ultimately, make lone Chairmen the norm."</p></blockquote>
That is a reputable employers' organisation expressing a genuine fear that has been expressed in different ways by members on both sides of the Committee. Against that background, the Minister should reconsider the entire clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLonghlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping for unanimity in the Committee and I am sorry that that is not the case.

The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden asked me about variations in workloads. Although the workload
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
in Scotland has increased considerably in recent years—last year's figure of 5,803 registered applications showed an increase of 83 per cent.—the increase in Scotland is much lower than that in England and Wales, where there has been an increase of 136 per cent. on the figures for 1988–89.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden also suggested the introduction of an annual report. The Committee may return to that idea at a later stage, because I understand that the Opposition have tabled an amendment that would give effect to that proposal.

I accept what the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said about the importance of confidence. I have already said that that is vital. No one wants more appeals. That would be counterproductive. Of course we shall consider the situation and have regard to what the Council on Tribunals says about the way in which tribunals operate. I believe that the clause will result in the speedier determination of tribunal cases, which will add to the effectiveness of the tribunal system not discredit it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 224, in page 45, leave out lines 23 to 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still unsure of the Government's purpose in introducing the clause, because it alters the balance. Industrial tribunals and, previously, appeal tribunals included one representative from the employers and one representative from the employees or two from each side, but at least, they were balanced. The clause introduces imbalance to appeal tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that sometimes, appeals are dropped and delayed for three months because those involved cannot agree when the next day of the hearing should be. The clause is another attempt to speed up appeals in the tribunal system. It is important to return to the issue that we have discussed at length and that has run through our
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
debates, and that is the issue of confidence in what is happening. Even if the parties consented, it would be easy to understand one party saying that the tribunal would take three months but that if the other party agreed to the concession, the decision could be knocked off by tomorrow. The poor, innocent person would be faced with a learned judge bearing down from on high. The Opposition are worried about that and we should be grateful for the Minister's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first part of the new subparagraph replicates the current provision that the employment appeal tribunal may sit with a judge and one lay member, instead of two lay members, if the parties consent. This provision, which is similar to that applying to industrial tribunals, was contained in the previous Labour Government's Employment Protection Act 1975, now consolidated into the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. That Act also provided that the appeal tribunal may sit with four lay members, but not with three lay members. The second half of new paragraph 16(2) simply remedies that anomaly by providing that the tribunal may also sit with three lay members if that is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought the hon. Members opposite would welcome this change. Allowing the appeal tribunal to sit with one or three members—remembering that this can only be done with the consent of the parties concerned—may avoid the need to postpone a hearing should an appointed member fail to attend because, for example, of sudden illness, travel difficulties or some other unforeseen circumstance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my interpretation of the reason for the provision was right. The Minister will understand my concern, once again, that in these matters it is rarely a free and voluntary agreement that is entered into. A lowly worker, not necessarily confident, with the learned judge bearing down, would be offered the chance for the case to be heard quickly if he puts himself at a disadvantage. However, if he decides to maintain his rights, the case would take three months. That is undue pressure on the individual who is bringing the case. However, I can understand the Government's reason for the provision.

There is no need for me to go into great detail. The arguments are the same as those already advanced.

I know clearly why I tabled the amendment although I must say at the outset that I think that I have made
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
some glaring errors in the drafting that I think that the Opposition have not picked up but that, perhaps, we could come to a little later. My intention was to focus not on an issue of great political significance but on a matter of great practical importance. I should like to explain the background to this technical problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I became involved in industrial relations law and industrial tribunals soon after the 1971 Act introduced the remedy of unfair dismissal. During the 12 years or so that followed that act, before I became a Member of Parliament, I must have handled around 1,000 cases in tribunals, many of which cases were settled. My amendment concerns the issue of settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When someone is dismissed by an employer, two distinct but overlapping remedies are open to him. The first is the traditional, age-old remedy of common law for breach of contract. That right has been and will be pursued when appropriate, through the ordinary courts until the Bill is enacted. Because it is a remedy under common law, it can be resolved through common law. The parties can reach an agreement, sign up that agreement between themselves and express it to be a full, final settlement of any dispute between them. That agreement, save in the most unusual circumstances, is then completed by law. A court will not look through that agreement and try to reopen the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When unfair dismissal rights were introduced, the situation became a little more complex. The course open, which runs through the fabric of statutory rights, was the basic provision that individuals could not contract out of their statutory rights. That meant that if a man had been dismissed, had taken advice, reached agreement with his employer, and both were happy with the terms of the settlement, they could sign up that settlement as far as common law rights were concerned but, as far as statutory rights were concerned, what they signed was barely worth the paper it was written on, because it would have been deemed to have been contracting out of the statutory rights that has been provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For most of the time that I practiced, there was a simple, practical solution. Having reached agreement or, even, before reaching an agreement—certainly long before anybody thought of putting in an application to an industrial tribunal—parties would call in a conciliation officer from ACAS, who would look at the deal. If he was happy that the deal was fair, he would sign it all up on a form that, at that time, was called COT 3. That would work similarly to the old common law receipt in full and final settlement of the claim. That piece of paper was a settlement under the statutory rights protection, rather than something trying to exclude it. The industrial tribunal would accept that COT 3 receipt as being a binding settlement of the issues. Employers and employees could happily sign an agreement and the cash could be paid in the knowledge that that would be an end to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent times, for reasons about which I am not clear—I assume that they are resource-based reasons but that may not be so—ACAS has prevented conciliation officers from providing the service. I know that most conciliation officers considered that an important and practical way in which they performed a vital and valuable function in industrial relations. Therefore, they regretted that the power had been stopped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill deals not only with how one implements rights under statutory protection but combines the common-law
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
rights for breach of contract before an industrial tribunal. The fundamental issue that must be addressed is that the parties must reach an agreement that is bonding on both of them, or the whole process is meaningless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example came up in my constituency surgery over the weekend. An employer came to me to complain. He had had to make an employee redundant He had a statutory liability of approximately £2,500 but had paid £5,000. The employer had reached an agreement with the employee, offered him significantly more than his statutory rights and told him to consult a solicitor before saying whether he was happy with the deal. The employee consulted a solicitor, said that he was happy and requested an open reference. The employer wanted to help the employee to find another job, so he gave him a glowing reference. As soon as the cheque had cleared the bank account, the employee slapped in an application for unfair dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By any reckoning, that is an abuse. There is no way in which such problems can be avoided. I believe that it is infinitely to the advantage of industrial relations that, in such a situation, those involved have the opportunity to reach a binding agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under current legislation, the employer in this case will be disinclined in future to pay any more than the statutory minimum and will certainly not give a glowing reference to an employee who may take him to an industrial tribunal and use that reference as a basis on which to challenge the decision to make him redundant. That is good for neither the employer nor the employee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like my hon. Friend the Minister to explain why ACAS stopped allowing its conciliation officers to provide a practical remedy for such problems, and to recognise the problem and to reintroduce a solution—that is even more important as the question of contract disputes is being added to the role of industrial tribunals. If industrial tribunals are hearing contract disputes, can individuals legitimately sign settlements of contract disputes, or are such disputes to be treated in the same way as a dispute under unfair dismissal legislation? The best, simplest, most obvious and most straightforward solution is to return to the 1970s situation and to allow conciliation officers, through ACAS, to be able to sign agreements for both contract disputes and for unfair dismissal. I should like to hear my hon. Friend the Minister say that that is what the Government are contemplating—that they recognise the problem and consider my solution clear and straightforward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My amendment tries to offer alternatives in case, for reasons that I do not understand at the moment, that solution is unacceptable. I contemplated allowing a receipt signed by the two parties to be effective and binding in an industrial tribunal. I have not included that in the amendment because I concluded, on examination, that it would involve substantial amendment to the structure of the whole of statutory protection as it would, in effect, enable parties to contract out of the legislation. I assumed that that solution, although applicable for contract disputes, would not be acceptable in the context of the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I included the reintroduction of ACAS conciliation officers and the receipt through COT 3, which is the course
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
that I recommend. In addition, I tried to think through alternatives, if ACAS was, for some reason, unacceptable. The Committee will see that I included a provision for the settlement document to be counter-signed by a solicitor or a trade union official acting for the applicant That was to deal with the problem of the tribunal wanting to be satisfied that an individual had been separately and properly advised before he signed the document, rather than feeling that he might have signed under duress in the heat of the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confess that I now have severe reservations about those two latter solutions. Regarding the solicitor's role, while I think that that is a perfectly effective means of dealing with this matter—a solicitor is an officer of the court and has no other axe to grind—I am concerned about introducing something that would automatically add to the cost of industrial relations. I speak as a solicitor, perhaps against the interests of my profession. It may be a solution if no other were available, but I would be reluctant automatically to import costs into the settlement of such a case. Inevitably, were extra legal costs involved, employers would be less inclined to be as generous to employees in offering settlements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I originally proposed the trade union officials' role in this matter, I thought that my proposal was a tidy way of dealing with the issue. I have now concluded that it is a poison chalice and I would not commend it to the Committee at all, because it could be argued by an individual that the shop steward who countersigned the individual's settlement might have had a conflict of interest
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not unknown for there to be an awkward individual on the shop floor with whom both the employer and the union are fed up. That employee is chosen for redundancy. His shop steward signs up and countersigns an agreement for a specific sum of money. In such circumstances, the individual would be precluded from going to the tribunal to complain about the employer, but could sue the union for negligent advice because it had a conflict of interest. From that point of view alone I would not commend that solution, although it had a superficial attraction for me when I drafted the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like my hon. Friend to recognise that the problem that I have outlined is serious and has to be dealt with. I have offered a range of solutions for how that could be done. My personal preference would be to reintroduce the role of the conciliation officer in signing up agreements. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will make a positive proposal, even though the amendment is clearly flawed, and that he will be prepared to come back with something workable in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not even sure whether legislation is needed. If conciliation officers could perform that function in the 1970s, I do not understand why they should not be allowed to do so in the 1990s. As that service was lost during the 1980s, I would feel more comfortable were there a statutory basis on which such advice could be given. It may have been that the problem arose from a dispute with ACAS as to what the statutory role of conciliation officers might have been. That role may have to be reinforced by legislation. I apologise to the Committee for raising expectations about a massive new role for trade unions but from that point of view, on reflection, I think that such a change would be a poison
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
chalice. There is not much more that I can add, other than to commend the principles of the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment to a vote. The Government are consulting about this matter and will consider it further. It would therefore be premature for the Committee to make a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has explained why he thinks that the amendment is technically unsound. I should like to explain to him that part of the reason that the COT 3 procedure no longer applies is that ACAS felt that it was not its statutory duty to come in at the last minute to countersign an agreement that it had not been a party to developing and agreeing to initially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ACAS believed that its independence was threatened and that the worker was losing confidence in it because it was seen as being on the employer's side and having a vested interest The threat to its perceived independence and, therefore, the confidence that both sides have to have in it made ACAS end the COT 3 procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that many employers are unhappy about that and want an amendment. We may return to that matter later. However, I have outlined why COT 3 was dropped by ACAS. It is a matter that requires careful consideration. I should be pleased to hear the Minister say that he is not proposing to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has not just done my job for me. My hon. Friend the Member for Elmet raised an interesting point. I shall try to deal with it in two parts, because the position is different for the two types of claim to which he referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not necessary in so far as it relates to an agreement reached in respect of claims for breach of contract. Paragraph 21 of schedule 7 introduces changes that address the same concerns as those mentioned here. At present contractural agreements between employers and employees, which preclude the employees' rights to make complaints in respect of a breach of that contract are enforced in the civil courts whether or not advice has been sought from a lawyer, a conciliation officer, or a trade union official.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 21 of schedule 7 provides that, once an order has been made giving industrial tribunals power to hear such complaints, such agreements will similarly preclude an employee making such a complaint. It would be unreasonable if it were not so. The effect of the amendment would be that the agreements binding in the civil courts were not binding in industrial tribunals. I hope that that satisfies my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet about the changes proposed to breach of contract cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, turning to unfair dismissal, the amendment proposes that an individual would be able to contract out of his statutory rights providing that the agreement to do so was countersigned by a conciliation officer, a solicitor, or a trade union official acting for the employee. At present the employee can compromise that right only if appropriate action is being taken by the conciliation officer appointed by ACAS to resolve the dispute without recourse to the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
It is clearly important that employees should be able to enforce their statutory rights, as my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet recognised, and should be protected against giving up those rights through either coercion or ignorance. That is why section 140 of the 1978 Act limits the ability to contract out of those rights to cases where ACAS has been involved. The ACAS officer will be able to ensure that the individual is fully aware of the consequences of his or her agreement. However, I agree that where both parties freely come to an agreement in the full knowledge of the consequences, it can be wasteful of the tribunal resources if the individual can subsequently change his mind and lodge a complaint. My hon. Friend gave an example of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need safeguards and if any change were to be made, it should be limited to cases where the employee has advice from a qualified lawyer acting for him. As my hon. Friend knows, we have had representation about this matter and, as the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, we are consulting a wide range of organisations on their views whether a change would be merited. If the results of that consultation suggest that such a change would be welcomed, and that the interests of the individual would not be harmed, we shall introduce amendments to that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of what I have said, I hope that my hon. Friend will feel reassured that we will be revisiting this matter, if not on Report, in another place. We shall, I hope, come to a conclusion on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear what my hon. Friend has said. In moving the amendment, I was not necessarily suggesting a particular solution to the problem. I wanted the Government to come forward with a solution to a real problem which is, I believe, damaging to good industrial relations. The Minister has said that the Government are disposed to finding a solution and hope to introduce a provision during the passage of the Bill. I am delighted by what he has said and, in the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support extending the jurisdiction of industrial tribunals to include the common law offence of breach of contract. It makes sense to deal with both the common law claim for breach of contract and the unfair dismissal claim at the same time whenever appropriate. That saves extra administrative costs and is a tidy resolution to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure the Minister will recall, when we were discussing the money resolution I asked him several questions about this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am still troubled by the issue of legal aid. The Minister will be aware that legal aid does not extend to representation at industrial tribunals. If a person brings a breach of contract claim for damages in the High Court or the county court, legal aid will be potentially available to assist that person in making his or her representation. Given that industrial tribunals will have jurisdiction to
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
hear such cases, will the Minister explain to the Committee whether applications to industrial tribunals for breach of contract will be legally aided, not just to assist in preparing a case but to allow for representation before the industrial tribunal? It does not seem sensible to extend jurisdiction and then cut out access to legal aid, unless the Government are attempting to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of the legal aid budget. It would be helpful if the Minister would confirm whether that is the Government's intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will also be aware that not all the rules of evidence apply to proceedings before industrial tribunals. In most cases, that is welcome, because it allows proceedings to be slightly more flexible and it takes account of the presence of lay advisers to the chairman and the fact that applicants and respondents in some cases are not legally represented. Therefore, it is right to relax the normal rules of evidence, which are complex, arcane and often unhelpful. It would be informative, however, if the Minister will tell the Committee whether the normal rules of evidence will apply to breach of contract actions before industrial tribunals. At present, we have no idea what the relevant orders will provide. I hope that the Minister will deal with that question because it is important for the Government to address that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our discussion of clause 29, we heard some comments on the appropriateness of extending the tribunals jurisdiction. We have heard about the competence of chairmen of industrial tribunals to hear cases on their own. The argument was advanced for confining jurisdiction to the chairmen of tribunals because the issues were predominantly legal. If that is the Government's rationale, presumably, the normal rules of evidence will apply to breach of contract cases. However, I urge the Government to think carefully about that, because many applicants will be legally unrepresented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the principle is to bring litigants into contact with justice in a more speedy and streamlined way, and to give litigants in predominantly industrial cases the benefit of an appearance before an industrial tribunal, however comprised, I urge the Government to make clear in the regulations that the normal rules of evidence will not apply to breach of contract actions. That is logical. I know the argument about the competence of the chair alone to hear cases that are predominantly legal, but that overlooks the fact that these cases are inherently industrial. They will be brought largely—not exclusively—by people who are unrepresented. It would defeat the purpose of extending the jurisdiction of tribunals to complicate the matter by surrounding it with reforms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can respond to those points about the extension of legal aid to breach of contract actions and tribunals and say whether the normal rules of evidence will apply to such cases. I want to make it clear to the Minister and to my hon. Friends that I strongly support the extension of jurisdiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warmly welcome the clause, resulting as it does from campaigns to bring together two different aspects of the law, for which several of my hon. Friends and I have been fighting for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness said that the elements of a contractual dispute were different from those of an unfair dismissal suit. The two overlap overwhelmingly in the nature of the remedy available and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0723">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>675</span>
the compensation payable. In most events, an award of unfair dismissal will cover most of the compensation that would have been likely to have been awarded as a consequence of a claim under a contract. It is eminently sensible that both issues should be heard at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To a degree, I agree with the hon. Gentleman's remarks about evidence, but, in practical terms, I think that that will resolve itself. In hearing all the elements of the case, the tribunal will hear everything as presented by an individual in many circumstances. The facts will be before them. I suspect that how that is expressed in the decision may be a matter of fine tuning, but I do not think that it will provide much difficulty in practical terms because evidence which is admissable in relation to unfair dismissals will be heard and will be on the record when the tribunal comes to its conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask that legal aid not be extended to industrial tribunals—we have heard repeatedly that we do not want industrial tribunals to become more formalistic or more prone to having lawyers present. I can think of few items that would make them more formalistic than the availability of legal aid. It makes sense to try and retain the informality—that is the great benefit of shifting the jurisdiction away from the courts to the industrial tribunals. I do not want to import formality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, in the main, the unrepresented applicant is placed at a disadvantage in proceedings before an industrial tribunal if he or she is arguing a case against a legally represented respondent? Would not legal aid redress what would otherwise be a patently unfair disadvantage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My experience in such cases has been that the chairman of the tribunal bends over backwards to ensure that the unrepresented litigant's case is fully explored. I have often felt that the respondent faced an up-hill battle because the legally qualified chairman of the tribunal, by arguing the applicant's case, almost put himself on the applicant's side, however unconsciously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to hon. Members for giving basic support to the clause. To answer the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness, those who wish to apply for legal aid to assist their breach of contract claim may continue to pursue their cases through civil courts. Industrial tribunals are provided to set up a speedier, more informal means of settling employment disputes than are civil courts and the procedures have been designed with that in mind. Legal representation is not required and legal aid will not be available. That follows from the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet about the difference between the powers of civil courts and industrial tribunals. It is important to bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normal industrial tribunal procedures will apply to rules of evidence. They do not necessarily require strict tests, as do the normal rules of evidence in civil courts. That explains some of the differences in formality between civil courts and industrial tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I will bear in mind my hon. Friend's comments about the order and will consider it at a more appropriate time when the order comes into operation. I am grateful that the Committee generally welcomes the
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>

and Government amendments No. 232 and No. 233.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Government amendments No. 231, No. 232 and No. 233 will make three further commonsense changes to the statutory framework for ACAS and so help secure the continued effectiveness of that organisation in achieving improvements in industrial relations. ACAS does a necessary job well and we wish to modify and update the framework, not to overturn it. Taken with the existing provisions of clause 32, and the new clauses on charging, these amendments complete the reforms identified by a recent review of ACAS. I should like to set out briefly the case for each of them and outline my case against amendment No. 129.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 231 modifies ACAS's statutory terms of reference to place greater emphasis on its core business of dispute resolution. Section 209 of the 1992 Act sets out the general duty of ACAS to promote improvements in industrial relations. The amendment links that general duty in particular to the exercise of ACAS's functions in relation to the settlement of trade disputes by a conciliator, in section 210, and arbitration, in section 212.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time of competing demands for ACAS's services and general resource constraints we believe that it is right that the terms of reference provided for in the legislation should give a better steer to ACAS on where its strategic priorities lie. The amendment achieves that by emphasising the central task of dispute resolution. However, it does not prevent ACAS officers from carrying out an of the duties currently laid down in the 1992 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 232 makes changes to section 213 of the 1992 Act, which lays down ACAS's advisory duties. The most important change here is the removal of the specific requirement that advice given by ACAS must be without charge. That approach prohibits and creates obstacles and uncertainties for ACAS in seeking recovery of costs for advisory publications and events when it would otherwise be sensible for it to do so. The ACAS council supports the change. The amendment will clear the way for ACAS to be able to charge for advisory work—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the ACAS council supported the change. It does not support the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0724">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
statutory rights taken by the Secretary of State to direct it. ACAS supports the power to charge for limited publications. Is that what the Minister meant? I think that he was trying to suggest that ACAS supports not only the provision contained in the amendment, which is just a forerunner to new clause 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to address that point later. As I was saying, ACAS will be able to charge for advisory work where it considers a charge to be justified. ACAS is expressly forbidden from doing so under section 213 of the 1992 Act. The changes will give ACAS the scope to secure greater cost recovery where that is the right course. A new clause will confer a new power for ACAS to charge for its services and a reserve power for the Secretary of State to require ACAS to charge. The amendment also takes the opportunity to improve the drafting of section 213. For example, it removes the long and superfluous list of subjects upon which advice may be given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal briefly with amendment No. 129, but perhaps I should leave that until after I have heard what the Opposition want to say on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 233 deals with the post of the ACAS chairman. Rather oddly, section 249(2) of the 1992 Act requires that the chairman must be full time. The amendment removes that requirement, bringing the chairman into line with other council members, whose appointment can be full or part time. That change will bring greater flexibility in structuring and fulfilling the chairman's post for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of the reference to collective bargaining in the ACAS statutory terms of reference will bring positive benefits and will not prevent ACAS from performing any of its current statutory duties. I emphasise that amendments Nos. 231, 232 and 233 are the result of careful consideration in the light of a thorough review of ACAS. They do not alter the fundamental principles of independence, impartiality and professionalism upon which ACAS is based. They make sensible modifications to the framework within which ACAS operates and so help to ensure that it continues to make an effective contribution to the improvement in industrial relations. I hope, therefore, that the amendments will be supported by Members on both sides of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While explaining the basis of the amendments and the changes that they would introduce, the Minister gave the impression that they were common-sense changes and that they had the support of ACAS. Neither impression is true. They are not common-sense but ideological changes. Even in the 1980s, when the Government's anti-trade union legislation was at its height, the Government never tried to introduce such changes. They propose to introduce them now partly because they are running out of things to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, the amendments do not have the wholehearted support of ACAS. I quote from a letter from Douglas Smith which was sent to the Secretary of State, dated 20 January. He writes that the council was
	<br><blockquote><p>"deeply disappointed and disturbed that you had felt unable to accept its unanimous representation on this issue."</p></blockquote>
I shall come back to ACAS's view on that issue and the related powers, which mostly concern new clause 9. I want
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
to make it clear that the Minister's attempt to give the impression that the amendments make common sense and that they have the wholehearted support of ACAS is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like the hon. Member to accuse me of misleading the Committee. I made the case for charging for the publications, which I believe was supported. The other matters are subjects to which we shall come and, no doubt, to which we are about to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never suggest that the Minister would mislead the Committee. That would not be possible. However, hon. Members might have variously interpreted what the Minister meant and he might have induced them to draw such interpretation. If the Minister is now going back on what he said and is clarifying it by saying that ACAS has no objections to charging for some publications, that is true. Unfortunately, the amendments and new clause 9 will not achieve that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to deal with the thrust of the amendments and the clause and then deal with each of the Government's amendments in turn. They are all linked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause withdraws from ACAS its general duty to promote collective bargaining. Previously, ACAS had a duty to promote the improvement of industrial relations and, in particular, to encourage the extension, development and, where necessary, the form of collective bargaining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That former duty no longer fits in with the Government's philosophy about how industry should work. They do not accept the role of collective bargaining and think that there should be a direct relationship between the employee and the employer. That would be the only relationship of any value. That is an outdated 1980s concept of industrial relations and of the relationship between employees and employers. An employment policy based on that concept will, like the economic policy of the 1980s, go down the Swanee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the role of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service not only to promote collective bargaining, but to conciliate trade union recognition in such cases. That important provision allowed trade unions to get a foothold. The Government will realise that that function of the ACAS service is useful as it will be in developing a new industrial strategy. ACAS has played a leading role in such arrangements, but the Government do not want provisions to promote collective bargaining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is despite the fact that article 4 of the ILO convention states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements".</p></blockquote>
Another international instrument of relevance is the Council of Europe social charter, which was signed in 1961 and which is complementary to the European convention on human rights. Article 6 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"With a view to ensuring the effective exercise of the right to bargain collectively, the Contracting Parties undertake:
	<ol>
	<li>to promote joint consultation between workers and employers;</li>
	<li>to promote where necessary and appropriate, machinery for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0725">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
voluntary negotiations between employers or employers' organisations and workers organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements;</li>
	<li>to promote the establishment and use of appropriate machinery for conciliation and voluntary arbritation for the settlement of labour disputes;</li>
	<li>and recognize:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
the right of workers and employers to collective action in cases of conflicts of interest, including the right to strike, subject to obligations that might arise out of collective agreements previously entered into."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
The Government are now reneging on those previous commitments. Is clause 32 consistent with the ILO convention 98? Is it now the Government's intention to denounce article 6 of the social charter? I realise, however, that that fits in with their anti-European behaviour with regard to social legislation. I remind the Committee that the quotation comes not from the social chapter but from the Council of Europe's social charter signed in 1961. The Government have removed that basis from collecting bargaining procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 231 would partly remedy the problem, although not to a great extent. It is better, however, than the way in which the clause was originally drafted. Section 210(3) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In exercising its functions under this section ACAS shall have regard to the desirability of encouraging the parties to a dispute to use any appropriate agreed procedures for negotiation or the settlement of disputes."</p></blockquote>
ACAS still has a foothold, albeit a limited one, in the procedure and the measure is not as draconian as it was initially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment No. 129 would re-introduce collective bargaining for all the reasons that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is some years since ACAS had a role in promoting collective bargaining. How would the hon. Gentleman re-start that role for ACAS and give it some teeth? At present, it is not promoting collective bargaining and the amendment reflects the status quo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be re-started at the will of a Government who are committed to re-establishing the rights of employees and industrial relations that are based not on fear and coercion but on cooperation to obtain the best not only for individual employees, but management and employees generally. That is the only kick start that is required, especially at Government communications headquarters in Cheltenham. However, you will rule me out of order, Mr. Knox, if I drift on to that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 232 is partly a paving amendment. Section 213 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 deals with the matters on which ACAS can give advice. The amendment strikes out the important part of section 213(1) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The advice may be given on request or otherwise and shall be without charge".</p></blockquote>
That is an extremely important change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the 1992 Act ACAS could give advice on request or otherwise without charge. That is struck out by the amendment. The reason is that new clause 9 gives the Secretary of State reserve powers to impose charges. I shall not speak about new clause 9 at length as it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
consequential, but the reserve powers of the Secretary of State to impose charges have serious implications for trade unions and industrial relations, which we shall discuss in due course. The amendment strikes out many other important aspects of the 1992 Act, such as those relating to collective bargaining and facilities for trade union officials, and generally removes many of the useful functions of ACAS, including its ability to undertake in-depth studies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 233 allows part-time chairmen. The Government will no doubt say that that will save time and money. They always talk about the need to bear down on costs. The great danger of allowing part-time chairmen is that such a chairman may also be an employer and therefore may have a conflict of interests. The importance of ACAS is that it is considered independent. We are back to the matters that we discussed earlier—trust and confidence. Over the years ACAS has built up trust on both sides of industry. That is threatened by the amendment. It should not be possible for the chairman to have a conflict of interests. The amendment is in breach of international agreements and conventions. It will be harmful not only to employers' and employees' rights, but to good industrial relations and industrial production in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments, particularly Government amendment No. 232, have further sinister consequential effects. For that reason, we intend to support our amendment and oppose all the Government amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a short clause which has drawn less attention than other, better-known clauses. Nevertheless, it is an important clause and needs careful scrutiny because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, its primary motivation is ideology, pure and simple. Nothing in the amended clause that the Government propose would enable ACAS to operate more effectively. The Government do not like collective bargaining in principle and they do not want the trade unions to play any meaningful role in employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week, we discussed wages councils and Conservative Members declared their support for the voluntary principle in the employment relationship. They said that wages councils were not needed because it was easy for those in that relationship to work together and reach agreements that were in the interests of all concerned. We did not accept that view in relation to the matters covered by wages councils and I believe that we proved our point. However, if Conservative Members really believed what they were saying, there is no basis for them to propose inclusion of the clause, because it will limit the Government's ability to support that voluntary principle in any meaningful way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the example of a worker previously covered by wages councils if they are swept away by the Bill. She and her colleagues agree that it is essential for them to join a trade union to try to ensure that the voluntary principle can be applied in their firm. The employer refuses to go along with them but there is no mechanism in Britain for statutory enforcement of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0726">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
recognition in those circumstances even if 100 per cent. of the employees want it. One of the few factors that could help would be to try to ensure that a voluntary agreement could be reached through the good offices of ACAS. Even in its modified form, whether the clause will allow ACAS to have a legitimate role in such circumstances is highly unclear. Indeed, most of the clause is concerned with the removal of a list of the functions of ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It reminds one of the old Fawlty Towers sketch in which people were not allowed to mention the war. The Government say that ACAS can do anything but no one is allowed to mention collective bargaining or any of the circumstances in which ACAS can offer its services under Section 213 of the 1992 Act. They include such matters as the recognition of trade unions by employers, machinery for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment, joint consultation, procedures for avoiding incessant disputes and workers' grievances, questions relating to communication between employers and workers, facilities for officials of trade unions, procedures relating to the termination of employment, disciplinary matters, manpower planning, labour turnover and absenteeism, recruitment, retention, promotion and vocational training of workers, payment systems, including job evaluation and equal pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Government will say that there is nothing in the Bill or their amendments that will preclude the involvement of ACAS in such matters, but why are they so coy about allowing those matters to be mentioned in the Bill? Those issues are important, and my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden referred to recognition, which is vital to the role of ACAS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last ACAS annual report showed that there was a 10 per cent. rise in the number of cases involving recognition in which it was engaged. From 1990 to 1991, it increased from 159 to 174 cases, in 33 per cent. of which recognition was obtained. So it is not good enough for Conservative Members to say that ACAS has no role in collective bargaining, because it is clear that it has. The extent to which the Government have attempted to undermine the process of collective bargaining wherever possible has made its role more difficult, but it is increasing not diminishing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not the case that it is years since ACAS performed any role in promoting collective bargaining? Its role has been to promote good industrial relations and to deal with trade disputes and employee disputes. It has done nothing on collective bargaining for years, so the clause merely reflects the present position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is just plain wrong; a recognition issue is about promoting collective bargaining. The extent of ACAS's involvement in collecting bargaining is not diminishing but growing—it is up 10 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The chairman of ACAS said to the Select Committee on Employment that it had not had a role in promoting collective bargaining for years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The facts speak for themselves. Its involvement in recognition issues has grown; it has not diminished. From my experience I know that that is partly as a result of the Government's initiatives. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
Government have recently been encouraging the creation of NHS trusts. I know that ACAS has been involved in ensuring that collective bargaining arrangements exist after the creation of NHS trusts. It is not true that ACAS has no role. The hon. Gentleman's definition of collective bargaining may be different from mine, but that is no basis for removing ACAS's role in the way that the clause intends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden referred to the international dimension, which is important, because it is arguably yet another matter on which the Bill is out of step with Europe. The implication of just appearing, by the back door, to deratify elements of the ILO convention, which Birtain has signed, and effectively to deratify the original social charter of 1961 is not good enough. I hope that the Government will think again about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that the clause, even in amended form, does not attempt to remove the independence of ACAS. According to the correspondence between the chairman of ACAS and the Government, that is precisely the area about which ACAS is worried. ACAS's independence can be threatened by allowing the Government to have more influence on its affairs regarding charging or altering the status of the chairman from full time to part time. The fact that the Government have tried to delete the list of areas that provide guarantees that ACAS can be involved in collective bargaining is a salutary warning about what they are up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is not what they are up to, I shall be reassured and pleased. However, there is only one way, or perhaps two ways, that they can prove that: they can accept the amendment or leave matters as they are. If they are not prepared to do either, I shall not give them the benefit of the doubt and shall believe that the motivation for the clause has its roots in the recommendation of Mr. Finney and Mr. Brady of the Policy Studies Institute who argued in their consideration of the 1991 Green paper that since 1979 ACAS has
	<br><blockquote><p>"been required to effect to promote policies wholly out of tune with those of the Conservative Government."</p></blockquote>
That is what is at stake here. The Government do not want an independent body that will promote better relations in industry. They want a body that is in tune with their particular ideological bent. That is not good enough. It has no place in the Bill. I hope that hon. Members will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief in following on from the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden). It is right that the clause shows the Government's failure to understand the sheer imbalance of power in the workplace. My hon. Friend referred to being out of step with Europe. I want to clarify that, because Europe is sometimes seen as an amorphous mass, with which Conservative Members are not so worried about being out of step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their attitude to collective bargaining in industrial relations separates them not just from the Labour party, but from all other Conservative parties in Europe. That was why it was so difficult for them to enter the European People's Party Group. They fail to understand workers' rights and the need to have free association and to be represented in order to right the inherent imbalance in industrial society. That has been recognised by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0727">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
Conservative parties in Europe since way back in the previous century. That right of free association requires a proper framework in which the social partners can bargain. The clause is not a great sounding-bell, but it chips away yet again at the idea that the only mechanism that can achieve a proper relationship between employees and their employer that has a degree of equity is collective bargaining.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden said, we shall have a more substantive debate about ACAS when we debate new clause 9. The Government do not accept that we are in breach of any of our international obligations. We continue to report fully to the ILO on the conventions that we have ratified, as part of a dialogue with that organisation. We shall continue to explain, using the normal machinery, why we believe that nothing in British law or practice is incompatible with any guarantees afforded by the conventions that we have ratified. That is the Government's position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the appointment of a new chairman of ACAS a few weeks ago, and he will work full time for two years. We should not want to impose any conflict of interest on the holder of that post, but that flexibility should be provided. Had there been a hidden agenda, we should have, first, not appointed a chairman and them appointed a part-time chairman once the Bill was enacted. Our intention is clearly to allow the Secretary of State and the person involved in the appointment the flexibility to decide whether the appointment should be full or part time.
