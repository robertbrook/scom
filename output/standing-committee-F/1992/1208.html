</div> <!-- ul --></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Both amendments refer to single union agreements and amendment No. 48 to the importance of a system akin to the present system of Bridlington principles. They are important matters on which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will wish to express their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 is the first of a series of amendments to clause 11, some of which we hope that the Government will look upon with favour, although others are far less likely to be acceptable, given the scope and intention of clause 11. None the less, the Government should at least be sympathetic to amendment No. 39, because it refers to the practice of single union agreements, which the Government have welcomed on many occasions. Certainly those which have been negotiated have worked well, especially in some successful firms. The Opposition are concerned that, although the Bill does not outlaw single union agreements, it will make their operation much more difficult and may create instability and uncertainty in workplaces in which, till now, there has been a good relationship between the recognised union and the management.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only the Opposition who are worried about this aspect of the Bill. In the briefing sent to all hon. Members on the Second Reading on 17 November, the Confederation of British Industry said that it had a practical concern about clause 11:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As regards trade union membership rights"</p></blockquote>
—the Bridlington proposal—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"the CBI has some concern that this measure may adversely affect the existing and welcome move towards single union agreements and single table bargaining arrangements."</p></blockquote>
The Association of British Chambers of Commerce was also concerned about this. It said that a number of problems might arise for the employer from clause 11:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It could mitigate against single union company agreements and the benefits they are generally perceived to bring."</p></blockquote>
We are probably all familiar with single union agreements in different firms. The one that I know best is that which operates in Nissan in Sunderland—or, more specifically, in Washington, Tyne and Wear. Such a firm would certainly not wish a single union agreement to be undermined, as could happen under the clause. Firms like Nissan have been among the few factors that have brought hope in a gloomy economic situation. The Government always say that they want Britain to continue to be a significant recipient of overseas investment, particularly from Japan. But they may find that many Japanese firms are, at the very least, doubtful about the effects of clause 11. There may be more worries, as they have come to accept the single union agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Worries about the prospect of inward investment, especially from Japan, arise from other aspects of the Government's policies. For example, the social and economic opt-out from the Maastricht agreement seems to put Britain somewhere on the fringe of Europe and may not make inward investors look so favourably on it in the future. The Minister looks astonished. Before I give way to him, may I point out that a survey by Ernst and Young of various companies in the United Kingdom states clearly that there is already evidence that the United Kingdom's attractiveness for inward investment is being reduced by a perception that the United Kingdom is not in the mainstream of the European debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I refer the hon. Lady to another Socialist, Mr. Jacques Delors, who declared that if the Prime Minister were successful in achieving the opt-out from the social chapter, it would make Britain a paradise for inward investors? I agree with that Socialist's point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I often agree with Jacques Delors's views; he was a former colleague at the European Parliament. On this occasion, however, I do not agree with him. The dangers of Britain seeming peripheral to the European Community outweigh any so-called advantages in being a sweat shop paradise—not that there are many advantages in that, and certainly not for people who are employed here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ernst and Young survey asked questions of a large number of United Kingdom companies which see a question mark over the future of inward investment. For that reason the Government should take the matter seriously. We certainly should not do anything to make inward investment more difficult, especially at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for Nissan-Sunderland, it is unlikely, given the general atmosphere there, that the single union agreement would be under threat. Nevertheless, if there were a category of workers in Nissan-Sunderland who were not doing the same job as the majority of workers, they might feel that the single union agreement was not working to their advantage. They might be tempted under clause 11
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>103</span>
to seek to join another union. Although the Government will no doubt say at several points during this morning's debate that joining a union does not involve recognition and representation, they would be unrealistic if they thought that workers who joined a union would not be interested in that union standing up for them in the workplace and seeking to represent them formally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unwise of the Government to take a chance in this clause and create difficulties by forcing out the single union agreements of which they were previously in favour. The Minister dodged the issue when asked specifically during the Second Reading debate what the implications of the clause were for single union agreements. I hope that he will respond more directly today and accept that our concerns, and those of the other organisations that I have cited, arise from a belief that we should not change something that is working well, especially if it would cause instability or threaten industrial harmony in some workplaces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 48 deals with the core of the Bridlington principles, which clause 11 is designed to do away with. Our amendment would reintroduce certain valuable aspects of the Bridlington principles and would allow unions to retain spheres of influence and activity which, if properly applied, would help, not hinder, good industrial relations. No one is saying that the principles are set in stone for all time but we are saying that they have lasted a long time and, on the whole, have served to arbitrate successfully in many industrial situations which, if there had been a free-for-all in union membership and recruitment, would not have been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us whether he feels that there is a great campaign among companies to scrap the Bridlington principles? Our impression is that that is certainly not so. Our contacts with representatives of companies and company organisations show that while there may be some reservations, there is no general campaign or crusade for the changes that are introduced in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that according to the Trades Union Congress introduction to its "Disputes Principles and Procedures" the principles were drawn up because trade unionists recognised that where more than one union was capable of representing a grade of workers it was necessary to prevent the indiscriminate proliferation of unions, if stable and rational trade union structures and collective bargaining machinery were to be developed. Their existence has also prevented the instability that would occur if breakaway unions were formed, or if groups of workers were able to move on a whim from one union to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Minister to the reaction of the Institute of Personnel Management, whose concern was particularly strong about the dangers contained in clause 11. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal to sweep away the Bridlington rules on union membership has not been given much support by industry managements. Though imperfect, this arrangement contributes to stable industrial relations in most organisations.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There has been no pressure from our members for any proposal to support the disbanding of the Bridlington rules. Whilst fully supportive of individual rights the removal of these procedures could be a destabilising factor.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Highly satisfactory changes in the 1980's including the establishment of 'single union sites' or recognition and brownfield 'single table' bargaining should not be placed in jeopardy by this proposal.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>The end of Bridlington may encourage shifts of membership between unions for short term gain to the detriment of settled patterns of collective bargaining."</p></blockquote>
I hope the Minister will take on board these and other objections to the Government's proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment No. 48 is composed of three separate parts, one of which is designed to incorporate the best of the Bridlington principles. Subsection (f) deals specifically with the danger of workers switching unions, perhaps through political motivation or disaffection of one kind or another and undermining a collective agreement which is working satisfactorily. Underlying our concern is our strong belief in the freedom to belong to a union, but when one belongs to such an association one needs a sense of responsibility and democracy. One has to respect the rules which have been decided by the majority of people in an organisation. Only when people feel that their views are consistently not being taken into account is there a problem. The Government will create problems through their proposals, rather than solve them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (g) of amendment No. 48 prevents union swapping where two unions are recognised and the member wants to swap between them—again because of our concern about the instability that such an arrangement can cause for collective bargaining and industrial relations in a work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Government will no doubt make great play of their belief in the freedom of the individual. They will say that that is something in which they strongly believe, too, but that lies uneasily with a Government who forbade people to join unions at Government communications headquarters, Cheltenham. Many of their activities have undermined trade union freedom rather than increased it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall confine my remarks to amendment No. 48, which deals with the Bridlington principles. As one of the minority of people who were born in Bridlington, and as I am naturally anxious to preserve the historical importance of my birthplace in national affairs, I am most concerned about the incipient threat to the Bridlington principles simply because it leaves us with only Charles Laughton as our favourite son with which to face the world. I am anxious that we preserve those principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more serious note, there are important issues here which fall into four categories. I am interested to know—I would like the Minister's comments on this when he responds—what model of industrial relations the Government are seeking to preserve by making the Bridlington rules unlawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) talked about the destabilising aspects of abolishing the agreement, which is basically a voluntary agreement that has been made between free trade unions that have decided to affiliate to the TUC. They have handed over to the TUC the authority to arbitrate in any disagreements which they may have with other unions, in the interests of good, stable industrial relations. It is a sensible agreement and a good way of doing things which has lasted since its inauguration in 1939 with no great trouble. There has been no great outrage in the country at the way in which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>105</span>
the Bridlington principles have worked, nor has there been any pressure from employees or employers to abolish the Bridlington principles. Why have the Government decided almost out of the blue that this agreement, which has worked extremely well, is unacceptable?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall talk later about the freedom of choice which the Government have mentioned as a reason for introducing this restriction, but we must consider, going back to the model of industrial relations which we hope to foster, that stability is an important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The setting up and operation of trade unions on an industry-wide basis in Germany is a model that we may wish to follow and we must not forget that that model was created in part with the help of the British TUC after the war, taking account of its experiences and wanting to set up a structure which it thought would be most conducive to good industrial relations. We ignore the experience of trade unionists and trade union officials in this important area at our peril; it should not be underestimated. Stability is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have spent my time working in and for COHSE, as Conservative Members know, and in the health service we have never had a closed shop. We have always had a multiplicity of unions that we could join. In some instances, often at branch level, there are niggling problems and some individuals will want to take groups of workers from one union to another for some pettifogging little problem that has arisen. Sometimes it is as simple as a personality clash. Full-time officials in the trade union movement will be happy to tell us that they spend some of their time arbitrating in personality clashes at branch level. We must not underestimate the destabilising effect that that sort of local event can have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another paradox, which I believe is embodied in the Government's proposal to get rid of an inter-union disputes procedure, relates to the orderly conduct of industrial relations. In other areas of their trade union legislation the Government seems to assume that trade union leaders and trade union officials, be they paid or unpaid, should take personal responsibility and liability in law for the conduct of their members in branches. At the same time, however, they want this almost military discipline, where they appear to be treating union members as if they were some branch of the army that can be ordered about, for good disciplinary reasons, so that they do not go on strike unofficially, leaving the union open to legal action in tort, or whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This discipline can also be exerted by the Government if the individual member of a union can run around and join whatever union he or she wishes and cannot be refused membership of a particular union, unless in very particular circumstances. The Government do not seem to believe that there ought to be a reciprocal responsibility for individuals who, after all, since we no longer have the closed shop, have made a voluntary decision to join a trade union, which is a voluntary organisation. Therefore one would expect that they would at least have some commitment towards abiding by its rules, which includes disciplinary rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the abolition of inter-union disputes procedures is anarchic. We are used to the Conservative party being into radical revolution, of an almost Maoist kind after the last 13 years, but they seem now to be a duality, so I should like the Minister to give us some views
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
on the destabilising effects of these proposals, because we are very worried about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, and always has been, as any left-wing or even radical left-wing member of a trade union that sells newspapers outside the tube station will tell you, a conspiracy by trade union full-timers to exert discipline, and usually very sensible discipline, on the members of that union to abide by collective agreements. They may not have got all that they wanted in the negotiations, but perhaps it is the best that can be achieved. If this crucial means of disputes resolution is lost, it will risk unleashing forces which full-time officials will not be able to control, simply because individual groups of trade union members, be they politically motivated or otherwise, will be able to take their ball elsewhere and possibly destroy entire agreements as they go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question as to what on earth a general union will do. There are proposals that would allow trade unions to prevent individuals from joining them. There are some very unsavoury individuals who tout themselves round wanting to join trade unions. A few members of the Government have done that. I believe that individual trade union branches and other trade unions ought to have the choice as to whether to accept them. The choice provided for in the legislation as it is drafted is much too narrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By doing this, the Government are unleasing forces which will be anarchic and disruptive and which will fracture good industrial relations. They risk doing a lot of damage and making much harder the job of full-time trade union officials, which is to represent the collective view and to take a majority decision, although everybody may not agree with it. It also risks good industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very well for the Conservative party to believe that there is no such thing as society, but there is such a thing as a collective decision. When one joins a trade union, of course one has individual rights, but there is also a collective decision to which one has to respond. When a collective decision is made people decide to make a particular point, or to support a particular policy. In the Conservative party, perhaps, as well as in the Labour party, not everyone will agree with it, but everyone has to go along with it because a democratic decision has been taken. We can campaign to change it. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] We could debate whether it is democratically decided in the Conservative party. It is democratic centralism in the Conservative party and perhaps democracy, from the ground upwards in the Labour party. If one joins an organisation, one has a duty to accept its decisions, even if one disagrees with them and is in the minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue raised by the clause that we ignore at our peril is that a trade union cannot stop a member or a group of members joining it other than for special reasons. That is an intolerable interference in a voluntary organisation's internal affairs. Imagine if that were to apply to the MCC. If I decided that I did not want to be a member of Wallasey cricket club, or that I wanted to join the MCC and carry on my disruptive ways there, I am sure that the MCC would be the first to blackball me before I reached the door, partly because I am the wrong sex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause provides that any person can join any union that they see fit, so long as it has something vaguely to do with their job. The general unions, which have a wide
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>107</span>
range of membership in all kinds of professions and jobs, would find it even more difficult than the sectoral unions such as COHSE to prevent individuals from joining. COHSE, for example, will expel people who are racist or who have been found guilty of sexist conduct, such as sexual harassment. Its rules make provision for getting rid of such members, and that is as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although a member who wants to join a union can be debarred because of previous conduct, the Bill does not make it clear whether that means previous conduct in another union. Will the Minister clear that point up? We must accept that there are people who go round causing trouble. Some of us have them in our surgeries occasionally. There are always troublemakers in any organisation. Individual organisations must be able to decide whether they want to admit a person to membership. Clause 11 makes it sound as if they have to do so, whether they want to or not, which is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect is that if groups of trade unionists decide to move to another union, the second union may not want to service them as members. It costs money, time and effort to represent a group of workers properly. It is not always economic for a trade union to provide proper representation for a group of workers in a different area of work? That is why spheres of influence agreements emerged in the first place. It is a more efficient and effective way of representing a work force. What is the good of being a member of the Ceramic and Allied Trades Union if one works in a textile workshop in London? Certainly the Ceramic and Allied Trades Union full-time officials would not want to spend time and carry out the necessary research work that would be involved in negotiating on behalf of such a member. Therefore, there is no point in it getting involved. Again, the clause ignores the reality of industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that trade union members should be able to choose. That is a red herring, because it posits that a group of general unions will have to represent everybody who comes to them, which is nonsense. That is why individual unions have grown up: they have particular expertise. COHSE has expertise in professional nursing issues, which the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trades Union perhaps would not have. Trade unions have developed expertise in certain areas. That is why they are better at representing those sections of the work force. They do not want small break-away groups from other unions to join them. It is too much trouble, they come from areas of work where they do not have expertise and it will not be conducive to good industrial relations. So why are the Government legislating to compel them to accept that kind of membership?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want finally to say a few words about why the rights of trade union members have much more to do with their rights at work and their rights to recognition by their employer—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady made the point about general unions not being able to refuse membership. Surely that is dealt with under section 174(2)(c), which says that it is permitted to expel or exclude
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of a union whose purpose is the regulation of relations between its members and one particular employer or a number of particular employers who are associated",</p></blockquote>
and in those circumstances
	<br><blockquote><p>"he is not, or is no longer, employed by that employer or one of those employers".</p></blockquote>
Would that not cover it, or even the previous subsection, (b)? Or is that wrong?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is not whether it would be covered, but that legislating about the minutiae of union membership is all wrong. In my view it is not a proper use of the law to legislate in such minuscule detail about which members should be allowed to join which union. Surely independent trade unions should be allowed to decide whether to admit individuals or groups of members. Why should the law become embroiled in these areas of controversy? It is much simpler and more efficient for individual unions to decide which sorts of workers they feel able to represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had the wrong subsection. I apologise. I misread my notes. It should have been subsection (2)(a):
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) The exclusion or expulsion of an individual from a trade union is permitted by this section if (and only if)—(a) he does not satisfy, or no longer satisfies, an enforceable membership requirement",</p></blockquote>
which, as specified in subsection (3), relates to employment in a specified trade, industry or profession, occupational description, or possession of specified trade, industrial or professional qualifications.

Would that not cover the hon. Lady's point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from my objection that it is not an area that the law should concern itself with, the Bill does not deal with general unions, which is my concern. General unions represent a vast array of workers in different areas, and it is possible that a person doing almost any kind of work could make a plausible case to be allowed to join and be represented by a general union, whether the union wanted to represent that person or not. That seems wrong. Therefore, I should be grateful if the Minister could enlighten us about the role that he sees for general unions in the clause and whether he thinks the clause would allow them to say "No, we shall not represent you".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even public sector unions such as my own represent thousands of different jobs in the health service, ranging from doctors all the way through to plaster technicians, photographers and gardeners. It is possible to make a case for people in a wide range of jobs to be allowed to join even a sectoral union like COHSE, even if they do not work for the health service but do a job that the union represents, through one of the complex Whitley council arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say a few words about the fact that the Government seem to be concentrating on what is almost a non-right to join a trade union according to which banner one prefers, or whether one prefers Rodney Bickerstaffe to Bill Morris. It is absurd to concentrate on this so-called right—which is about as substantial as clutching a handful of sand and just about as useful—when important and serious employment rights have been systematically taken away from the work force by the Government and continue to be weakened. There is virtually no right of appeal to an industrial tribunal

against unfair dismissal. There is no such right for a part-time worker who has been employed for fewer than five years and none for a full-time worker who has been employed for fewer than two years, yet it is possible to go before an industrial tribunal and claim substantial damages for being refused access to the trade union of one's choice. There is no reciprocal arrangement in law that provides that that union should be represented by the employer. It is a bizarre use of the law to insist that somehow this is a great advance for individual rights when in fact it is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should get their priorities right and look at the real issues: employment rights and the right to representation and basic decent treatment at work from the employers rather than from the union. The union is there to protect the workers. In 99.9 per cent of cases it does a good job, because it is allowed to regulate whom it affects and where and why it affects them. Therefore I support amendment No. 48.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall carry on from where my hon. Friends the hon. Members for Gateshead, East and for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) left off and refer to someone whom my hon. Friends did not mention—vexatious, undisciplined Conservative members who have forced the Minister, quite wrongly, to slam into trade union barons. That is why we want to keep Bridlington. Most discipline within trade unions is carried out collectively at shop floor level, by means of lay members, shop stewards and shop chairmen. If my experience is anything to go by, those who are most difficult to persuade to resume normal working when a dispute has ended are those who probably voted Conservative, who profess to be Conservative and will not go back to work because the money is not enough. There is a real need to keep Bridlington because in factory life problems occur daily and are solved collectively. There are always some who will say, "I don't agree with you. I shall run away and join another union." That is no good for employers, who depend on shop floor discipline, which has been collectively established by the workers and enforced through their shop stewards or representatives. It is the result, rightly, of team effort, especially in manufacturing industries. There can be no room for the so-called vexatious, undisciplined member. I ask the Government to consider our amendments carefully—as my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) would have said, and may well have said, however badly they may have been drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remember that when Bridlington was first established in 1939 there was a plethora of trade unions all representing specialised skills, but time has moved on and there are far fewer trade unions. Some have amalgamated. Many now represent a general membership. That trend will not be reversed but will continue. We discussed trade union merger ballots when we considered previous clauses. The move is towards fewer, more streamlined trade unions. The principles established at Bridlington, no matter how many unions there may be in future, are as important today as they were then. No employer wants groups of workers to be able, at a whim, to move, for some vexatious reason, from one union to another, or to set up their own trade group and demand recognition, as they might be able to do under trade union legislation. We are moving towards harmonisation within unions and should leave well alone.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although clause 11 was trailed before the Bill appeared, I have always been surprised that the Government, given their other objectives, wish to include clause 11. It seems to run counter to a number of the other objectives that they normally seem to pursue. That is why the press release from the Department of Employment will be helpful. It gives some of the reasons for clause 11. The Bridlington principle is described as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a legacy from the 'big-brother-knows-best' era of trade unionism".</p></blockquote>
The Minister is said to take the view that
	<br><blockquote><p>"We should not insult thousands of employees by telling them which union they have to join if they want to be a trade union member. This bill strikes a blow for the freedom of choice of the individual. It will bring down the iron curtain imposed by the operation of these rules. Their time is long since passed and they will not be mourned."</p></blockquote>
That is apparently the reason for introducing clause 11 and for opposing the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, the right to join a trade union of one's choice and not to be excluded from a trade union that one wishes to join sounds a fairly seductive argument, but as my hon. Friend made clear, unless one can do something with one's trade union membership it is meaningless. In an era when one is not allowed in some industries to join a trade union and has no statutory right to trade union recognition, the right being sought here seems rather flimsy. The view that is put forward by the Government is that even if one cannot do anything with trade union membership, one should still be allowed to join. In practical terms, it often happens that people are members of more than one union. I recall that when I worked for the National and Local Government Officers Association one of our chief negotiators in one industry—I shall not say which—was also a member of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union. Technically, that was probably against the rules, but he was an electrician by trade and had been in the EETPU for many years. It was not right, but no one did anything about it, because it did not destabilise or affect anything. It was his own choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practical terms, if people want to be members of a union, even if they do nothing with their membership, that happens, anyway. One does not need to legislate for that to happen. The only circumstance in which a statute would have an impact, as opposed to being irrevelant, would be where it encouraged—or attempted to encourage—multi-unionism in places where there was an interest, not only on behalf of employees but of employers, to move away from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no accident; there has been a tremendous development of single union deals in recent years. A recent rough estimate suggests that there could be between
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>111</span>
150 and 200 such deals and they are on the increase. That is apart from those areas where certain recognised unions operate in particular areas—not just single ones but a small number.

If one goes down the road of encouraging the kind of anarchy that my hon. Friend encourages, one will not create stable industrial relations. The result will be destabilisation of industrial relations.

Going back to the 1960s, I know that the Donovan commission is not the most popular thing with Conservative members, but they must accept that the commission was right on some things. It pointed to the great problems that can occur when multi-unionism grows and to the fact that, if one is to regulate that, the TUC is the obvious body to perform the task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give an example of how encouragement of multi-unionism can lead to serious problems and to disputes not being settled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember a case—I will not mention which industry it was in—of three unions operating in a particular place. A dispute broke out because a member of one of the unions was dismissed without regard to procedures, appeal rights and so on. All three unions operated very democratically; they went through their procedures and decided that they would take industrial action. They all voted the same way: to take some action in response to that dismissal. The industrial action commenced, which triggered negotiations, which was all to the good—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to clarify one point. The hon. Gentleman said that there are about 200 single union agreements. It is worth pointing out that 120 of those single union agreements are with the Amalgamated Engineering Union. Is not that indicative of the type of agreement that can be struck by a trade union which is at the forefront of supporting changes to union rules and legislation in past years? Perhaps if other unions were a little more supportive and aware of the benefits of the changes in trade union legislation, many more unions might support and welcome single union agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Warley, West (Mr. Spellar) will discuss with the hon. Lady at length the approach that has been taken by the AEU. We are not dealing with whether a particular form of trade unionism is good or bad—I am happy to discuss that. What is being discussed here is whether any union—whether it is the AEU, the Transport and General Workers Union or the GMB—has the right to discuss with employees and employer the sort of industrial relations that they want to create—without being subjected to anarchic intervention from elsewhere. Whatever strategy is adopted, this clause, as it stands, will inhibit that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Going back to my anecdote on the dispute, the three unions voted for industrial action. Negotiations commenced and led to a suggested agreement. At that point, the ability to ensure that that agreement started and to ensure that even the democratic discussion could take place, so that the employees in that workplace could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>112</span>
come to a decision about whether they wanted to terminate their industrial action, was very difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All three unions were trying to operate democratically and were attempting to operate within their own rules. There was a majority union, but they were not the first union to meet to discuss what to do about the agreement. The first one to meet was the minority union, which decided that the agreement that had been reached was not satisfactory. It did not guarantee the rights of the employee to be dismissed, so it voted to continue its action. The majority union then met, within 24 hours of the minority union doing so, and took a different view. It decided that, even though the agreement was not ideal, it was the best that was achievable under the circumstances. The third union, which was the smallest of all and the one to which the dismissed employee belonged, came to the same decision as the minority union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the next three days there was a hiatus. Nobody was entirely sure whether the dispute was carrying on or whether it was off. The members of the minority union did not want, as they saw it, to be pushed around by those in the majority union. Equally, those in the majority union did not want their affairs to be dictated by the members of the smallest union. At the end of the day it was sorted out. An agreement was reached, a few changes were made and that strike has not continued to this day. If, despite the reality that it makes sense for all those who work in the same work place to belong to the same organisation, we are to encourage people in a plethora of different organisations to say that they want the right to opt out of the majority view in that work place, a problem will be created not just for the union; it will be, and has been, a problem for orderly industrial relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case the employer felt that their company needed a multiplicity of unions like a hole in the head. For the employer, the important thing was to have the dispute resolved and to get on with the company's business, but resolution of the dispute was held up, not because of the fault of any one person but because of the anarchic industrial relations situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why it does not seem to me surprising that we should be looking towards fewer unions in certain work places and that there should be a trend towards single-union deals in a number of industries. Nor is it surprising that not only trade unions but employers' organisations have expressed a good deal of concern about the clause. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce, the CBI, the Institute of Personnel Management and, informally, many individual employers, who are no great friends of ours in many cases, say, "Why are the Government trying to do something about this? It will not contribute to stable industrial relations. The Bridlington procedure can resolve any problems of competition between unions". They say, bluntly, "If it ain't bust, don't mend it." If Conservative members believe what they say about other areas of industrial relations reform, even though we disagree over a number of other objectives this one is not bust, so what on earth is the point of trying to mend it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Gateshead East said a while ago that the proposals to regulate this area and effectively to end self-regulation were intolerable. I am sure that she will accept that there are degrees of intolerance:

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>113</span>
sometimes it is absolute and definite, but sometimes legislation is intolerable only in comparison with other legislation in the same country or under the same legal system. I draw the attention of members of the Committee to that fact. What first struck me when I read the Bill before Second Reading were the inconsistencies in the Government's trade union legislation, compared with the way in which they have dealt with other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause has been inserted in the Bill effectively to end the self-regulation commonly known as the Bridlington agreements. Why on earth has the same action not been taken in the City, where there are so many abuses? The entire financial system of this country is being brought into disrepute at Lloyds and other institutions. Why is it that the Government support self-regulation in those areas, yet are totally opposed to self-regulation in this area?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say yet again that when laws that are so partial are made, we bring the whole legal system into disrepute. There is clear partiality in the way that the trade unions are being dealt with in this clause of the Bill and the way that other institutions are being dealt with in this country by the Government. I think that they need to address that problem if they are to maintain any credibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a time when we could talk about issues such as the industrial structure and trade union structure in this country in a non-dogmatic way. Perhaps I kept better company then than the company I tend to mix with nowadays; I never met as many members of the Conservative party in the past as I do nowadays. But we used to talk about the structure of our industry, of our commerce and of our trade unions in a far less dogmatic way than we do now. According to my recollection, there was broad agreement about some of the problems that we face, compared with other industrialised countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We may well have had different objectives and looked at the problem from a different angle, but we often looked across to Germany and Japan and compared what they did with our own structures and problems. There was wide consensus that our problems arose in part out of the fragmentation of the British trade union movement, compared with what happened in those trade union movements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made by other members of the Committee to the fact that the TUC in Britain had a role in setting up the German system after the war. Although Germany may have its problems now, largely as a result of reunification and the problems that it has inherited from east Germany, but the German system has served them well, by comparison with ours. We have seen them grow massively over the last 40 years in terms of industrial strength and the level of salaries and wages and general living conditions that they have been able to offer their people, compared with what we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was consensus that what we did not want was fragmentation of the British trade union movement. The movement has responded in large part to that. The restructuring that has gone on over a long period has led to a great number of mergers that have ended some of the conflicts that used to arise. We are now effectively getting rid of the deregulation abilities of the British trade union movement. That will have the effect of driving us back to conflicts. I try to put myself inside other people's heads to try to understand what they perceive the problem to be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what experience the hon. Gentleman has. He had the wrong clause the last time he intervened. If one hopes to be a serious participant in a debate of this nature but is unaware of the deep restructuring that has gone on in the British trade union movement, one is in difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not have before me the exact number of trade unions left in the country. I am sure that many small organisations are in single-company situations, but there has been a massive restructuring of the British trade union movement, as the hon. Gentleman ought to realise. That has taken place largely through initiatives from within the movement itself. Compared with 15 or 20 years ago, its structure is unrecognisable, by anyone who operates within it, or within industry and the public sector at large. The process is continuing with the proposed amalgamation of the public sector unions. I hope that that will bring better regulation in its wake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are talking about is whether unions should be allowed to regulate their dealings with each other, or whether they should be prevented by the law from doing so. That is what the clause proposes at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tried to get inside the heads of the people who thought up the Bill and to understand what their priorities and their intentions were. The only view I could come to was that they genuinely believed that by bringing to the workplace the dogma of competition between different unions, they would effectively prevent militant action from being taken by sections of the work force. They seem to hope that in circumstances where a union backs a dispute, another union will come along and provide those employees with an opportunity to get out of it by opting to join a union with a more moderate line on the issue concerned. That is probably the aim of the legislation. That may happen, but the Government must recognise that the reverse will also happen. When difficult decisions have to be taken in a company or industry, a union may be required to take its membership down a particular line to enable that company or industry to survive and to enhance its members' job prospects. It may have to sell to its members difficult decisions, and get them to go along with things that they may not accept at face value are in their interests. In such cases, other unions—perhaps not at national but at local level—may undermine that constructive approach and seek to use the position for the purposes of recruitment. The Government will effectively have provided the legal right for them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>116</span>
The Bill is, therefore, a double-edged sword: any advantages that the Government expect to see from it will be offset by disadvantages. But that is only a small part of the problems that will arise. Fortunately a few large concerns are left in this country—as a result of the Government's policy, very few. Some of us are anxious not only that small businesses should succeed but that large businesses should continue. There are one or two major concerns that provide massive employment, and those who have not worked within such a structure need to recognise the issues that will arise, which are totally non-political but which could result in anarchy and chaos if people are allowed to behave in the way that the law now proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be realised that petty jealousies exist between different strata of the work force. The storeman thinks he is better than the material handler and the track assembler is regarded as slightly inferior to the trimmer, the welder or the body finisher. The slight differences of status that people seek to maintain are sometimes justified and sometimes totally unjustified. Strong personalities can use those feelings, not to the disadvantage of the trade union movement in that company, but to create industrial chaos, to ensure that collective agreements cannot hold and to prevent any constructive relationships with the employers from being formed. That is the situation that would effectively be allowed in law if the amendments are not carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald) asked whether the situation to which I have referred was not covered in paragraph (a) of subsection (2). Sometimes it will be, but in general unions and unions that do not confine their recruitment policies to particular sectors of workers, it most certainly will not be. People will find themselves in chaotic situations time and again, if we deprive the unions of their ability to self-regulate, the sufferers will be British industry, the British economy and our ability to make our way as a nation. In the rule books of almost all unions, the first clause deals with the regulation of disputes between employers and employees, and the second with the regulation of disputes between employees and employees. Disputes between employees and employees are not rare: they are a common occurrence. They are sorted out repeatedly by the trade union movement under single-union agreements or spheres-of-influence agreements within multi-union set-ups. They effectively make sure that such disputes between employees and employees do not disrupt the industrial life of the company in which they operate. The Bill proposes to deprive unions of the ability to do that. It is a disaster, which will lead us to revert to the fragmentation that existed some years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is interesting to note that references have been selected that omit the key matter relating to Dundee—namely, whether Ford in the United States wanted that decision to go ahead or whether the industrial relations issue was used as an excuse. The quotations from heavy newspapers and tabloids fail to mention that important part of the debate. Openness about inward investment matters is welcomed by Members on both sides of the Committee and is not a one sided issue, as has been suggested.

My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey referred to the history of Bridlington as a town. I have no great devotion to the place; I apologise to my hon. Friend for that. The Bridlington principles, however, are simple. In joining the TUC, unions give it the authority to resolve disputes between them. It is a self-regulatory mechanism that was devised some time ago and has worked remarkably well in broad terms. In recent years, as a result of some of the decisions—not matters which were dealt with in an iron curtain manner as described in the press release, because the reports of Bridlington disputes are quoted verbatim to congress every year—the very nature of those debates has stimulated important discussions inside the trade union movement which have moved us towards a reduction in numbers of trades unions and mergers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. DAVID KNOX 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>The import difference between the structure of our trade unions and that of many of our European counterparts will be discussed in some detail later. I ask the Minister and Conservative Members to listen to this argument carefully because there is a genuine desire on both sides of the House that we should create structures which, as far as possible, introduce stability in industrial relations. I do not suppose that anyone will challenge that concept. The point that was made by the hon. Member for Meriden illustrated the way in which, historically, industrial relations were marred by great numbers of trade unions working together, or, in some cases, against each other, in a peculiar free market operation which from time to time caused disruption.</p>
	<p>In industry now changing technologies and methods are challenging the way in which bargaining structures
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>118</span>
operate. Those changes should be the prime driving force in changing bargaining arrangements and the structure of trade unions. To regulate from on high with the kind of minutiae that is referred to in this clause, will interfere in that process in a very damaging way.</p>
	<p>I referred to changing technologies and methods. More and more companies are introducing new management structures based loosely on the principles of TQM, total quality management, and varieties of that principle apply up and down the country.</p>
	<p>One company, in which I had a great deal of experience, wished to make some structural changes in its whole management structure. That required fundamental changes in the bargaining process. As one Conservative Member said, the great difficulty was that in two factories there were about 22 unions. The way in which this clause is structured could have resulted—I think the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald) said that there are still 300 unions—in 300 being involved. Clearly, 22 is a difficult number to manage and larger numbers would make it impossible. As it happens, through good will from both parties, a move took place which resulted in the introduction of a single bargaining table, which is a positive step forward in the context of the changing management methods that are being applied in industry today.</p>
	<p>Where that leads to in the longer term depends on the second part of the discussion—the way in which the number of unions is reducing. That single bargaining table may, in the longer term, represent not 22 unions but two, three or even down to one. It depends on the changing structures of the trade unions.</p>
	<p>I referred also to changing technologies. I have to be careful at this point. I was tempted to tell an anecdote that involved my union and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Warley, West (Mr. Spellar), but one of the lessons that I have learnt in this place is how far the tentacles of the Whips Office reach, so I shall be sensitive about the way in which I introduce these points.</p>
	<p>In the electronics industry, where technologies are changing extremely rapidly, from time to time one comes across situations where a group of workers has historically been represented by one union and, because the changing technology has either increased or decreased the level of skill, another union has sought to obtain recognition rights for that group of workers. As the clauses are drafted that change will put continual pressure on companies to change their bargaining structures in recognition of those changing technologies. The Minister is shaking his head, but I ask him to listen to what some of the representatives of management organisations have said about this matter in positive terms.</p>
	<p>Comparisons with our European counterparts have also been referred to. Such comparisons must be looked at carefully, especially as we are in the week of the great Edinburgh summit. Is the Minister really saying that the kind of structures that exist in Germany, which have been referred to in some detail, are not the kinds of structure towards which we should be moving? For example, I.G. Metall has a good working relationship with Chancellor Kohl, as well as many other companies. From time to time it moves into conflict. That is inevitable. That is what free trade unionism is about. Nobody would deny the work force the right to enter into conflict, but it is very rare in Germany. Is the Minister really saying—Minister,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>119</span>
listen to this point—that that kind of structure is not something to which we should aspire? If you do not want that kind of change, you will go ahead with the clauses and introduce the free market into trade union structures, and then we shall all move rapidly backwards.</p>
	<p>I have worked extensively in recent years with colleagues from unions throughout Europe and I have no doubt that the clause would be a retrograde step. I ask the Minister to think very carefully about pursuing it. There is substantial evidence that the principle that he is seeking to introduce would slow down the pace of reform and of mergers in trade unions and slow down moves towards not necessarily industry-based unions but a structure more in keeping with the century that we are rapidly approaching. I urge the Minister, on the basis of comparisons with other European countries, to step back from the clause and, if he is not prepared to withdraw it in its entirety, to accept the amendments tabled by my hon. Friends.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I consider myself to be a trade unionist as well as a Member of Parliament. I joined a trade union, the AEU, when I was 16 years of age and I am still a member of that union. I think back to the times when I worked in the factories and saw trouble developing, and I would say to the Minister, if you are really concerned about trade unionism and wish to see the democratic process take place, the last thing in the world you should wish to abolish is Bridlington. The Bridlington principles are sensible and have been working for a long time; they are always ongoing and improving. They are not set in tablets of stone.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bridlington principles are not set in tablets of stone but are always being improved. I am amazed that the Government have not done a genuinely independent assessment of what they are about. They have not spoken to many people who know what problems and difficulties with individuals can arise at a place of work. I can give the Minister examples. We had a dispute in Strathclyde, at the end of which—or during it—the members wished to move to another union. Does the Minister think that that would have helped the dispute?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is sponsored by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers. He will be aware mat some members wished to leave that union to join the GMB because they did not agree with the union's policy against Sunday trading. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that it was right that they should be prevented from joining the union of their choice because they did not agree with that policy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to answer the point that the Minister raised. USDAW represents workers in the shop industry. The GMB inherited the position from the Dairies Association and looked after Asda workers. That is the reason why the GMB represents workers in Asda. It causes confusion for workers in the shop industry.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>120</span>
Minister, I do not know if that makes sense. I am prepared to take up your time after the Committee to inform you of the reason why I gave that answer. I am prepared to give you a fuller answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is doing what he tends to do from time to time. When he addresses a remark, it must be to me. He may not address other members of the Committee directly. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection to the hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde taking up the Committee's time to explain this important point.

The members whom I know who wish to work on a Sunday wish to work for double time and workers' rights. Minister, can you tell me of any USDAW worker [Hon. Members: "Careful."]—I am finding it difficult; I will abandon "the Minister".

I return to my main point. The Bridlington principles are important and worthy of the support of this or any other Government. Everyone acknowledges that we have bad employers and, on occasion, bad employees. I do not accept the principle that groups of workers or individuals are right every time. They make mistakes. However, the Bridlington principles can help us to ensure that such mistakes are eliminated and taken on board in the wider context of trade unionism. They provide an excellent forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned Dundee. On reflection, that experience is a matter for regret. But it also resulted in people looking more closely at the principle of single trade union agreements and working to ensure that such agreements are made with the agreement of everyone. The lessons of Dundee have been learnt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals are a recipe for rebellion and discontent. They will not assist the trade union

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>121</span>
movement or employers. Most employers whom I know clearly wish the Bridlington principles to remain. The institute of management says that it is madness to do away with those principles. They are not set in tablets of stone but have been improved on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Meriden pointed out that there had been a dispute involving eight trade unions at a factory. If the building of a house were at stake, architects, solicitors, accountants, planners and surveyors would be involved. All of them have professional associations, but the Government are not moaning about that. They are not trying to regulate everyone. Their line does not offer any great help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government mentioned single trade union deals and agreements with single factories. I agree that mistakes were made, but the government cannot claim that we are not trying to do something. The biggest mistake that the Government have made is the poll tax, which they are now trying to remedy with the council tax. They are still not getting it right. However, they are clearly wrong to do away with the Bridlington principles. It is not sensible. Why have the Government not commissioned a proper independent assessment? Why are they throwing the baby out with the bathwater?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate in which a number of issues have been raised. The highlight for me was the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East appearing to deny his TGWU associations and his previous life as a shop steward. I am still not clear as to the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept that if "Dod's" says that I am a member of the TGWU it is incorrect and has been incorrect for the last 14 years? I was a member from the time that the NUVB amalgamated with it until 1979. I do not deny it. But since 1979 I have been a member of the MSF. Please do not suggest that I have said something that I have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman be more careful? He addressed the Minister again. I emphasise that all remarks should be addressed to the Chair, and that Ministers are referred to in the third person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East for making that clear. Either way, as I shall demonstrate in a few moments, both the TGWU and MSF have been guilty of using the Bridlington principles in a way that has not been in the interests of the work force or of British industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield said that his experience of the Committee had been useful in at least one regard: he had learnt something. He told us that he had learnt that Charles Laughton had been born in Bridlington. The hon. Gentleman should treat with some scepticism remarks made by his hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey. Charles Laughton was born in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough, not in Bridlington.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that Charles Laughton, Scarborough's most famous son, would have welcomed the abolition of Bridlington, not to say the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>122</span>
abolition of the Bridlington principles, especially in view of the activities of Equity? Ron Todd himself said of the Bridlington principles:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All I want quite frankly is the right for a worker to determine the union he wishes to join."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome Mr. Todd's remarks and I am sure that my hon. Friend would like to look carefully at clause 13. When we reach that clause, he will no doubt wish to contribute given his interest in Equity and the acting profession arising out of that association with his town.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the arguments of the hon. Member for Gateshead, East and I have to say that, unfortunately, none of the amendments is acceptable. In fact, they are quite unacceptable. The fact that they have been tabled, and the speeches that we have heard this morning, show a clear inability on the part of the Opposition to distinguish between union membership, which is what clause 11 is about, and union recognition, with which they have persistently sought to muddy the waters. The two are fundamentally different. The hon. Member for Coventry, North-East shakes his head, but union membership is a matter for individual trade union members—at least it is when the TUC is not trying to deny individual members choice in that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Trade union recognition is a matter for employers, and it is for them to decide, on the basis of the circumstances in the workplace, whether they wish to recognise a particular trade union for collective bargaining purposes and, if they do, whether they will bargain with a single union or with several.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister prepared to accept that it is beyond the realms of possibility that, if a particular section of workers within a factory decides to change from one union that is recognised within the collective agreement to another union that is recognised within that same collective agreement, the original union will continue to be allowed to represent them or to want to represent them? Is he seriously suggesting that if a particular section transferred from, say, the Transport and General Workers Union to the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the AEU would not represent them and the TGWU would continue to do so? The two are inextricable, surely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am seriously suggesting is that which unions people choose to join should be a matter for them and should not be decided in smoke-filled rooms, and which unions employers choose to recognise should be a matter for them, taking account of the interests of the work force and the interests of their company. The hon. Gentleman is advancing the age-old argument which has been put by dictators and collectivists over the years, which is that it is more efficient for two or three people to decide what is good for the rest. That is a philosophy which we reject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East put the case eloquently for abandoning the clause. We have heard about the reasons why people join trade unions and it has been argued that they do so largely in connection with the resolution of disputes. At our first sitting, however, the hon. Member for Coventry, North-East said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"People join trade unions for various reasons."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>123</span>
The hon. Member for Northfield said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The message from Opposition members of the Committee is that, for many different reasons, people may wish to be part of a … union. They may wish a trade union to be present in the workplace … on their behalf. They may have a personal commitment to membership of a trade union. They may even join a trade union for benefits concerning insurance, house purchase and so on. People join trade unions for many reasons."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 26 November 1992; c. 22–27.]</p></blockquote>
It is therefore rather surprising that the hon. Member for Northfield seemed to imply, with his anecdote of the three unions in a certain work place, that people only joined for the resolution of disputes. We have it in the words of ordinary union members that people join trade unions for a variety of reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being somewhat selective. I gave two anecdotes in my speech. One related to a small work place with a plethora of unions that got in the way of settling an industrial dispute. That, I hope, is something in which the Minister will be interested. The second anecdote concerned the leading negotiator in a firm in which NALGO operated, who was also a member of a different union for personal reasons, although nobody worried about it because it did not affect the employment situation. What I said today was that, where people have personal reasons, their membership does not get in the way. It gets in the way when it starts to affect the employment relationship, and the clause will aggravate that problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is merely repeating the case that he made earlier. I am merely reminding him that he told the Committee at our first sitting that people joined trade unions for a variety of reasons. Individuals want and should be able to join a union for all that it has to offer. The hon. Gentleman is seeking to restrict that choice because it might not suit a union or an employer. According to the arguments put forward in the Committee by the hon. Member for Northfield and other hon. Members, trade union members are not to be trusted to exercise their choice. If a union has made a collective agreement with an employer, the workers in that work place are to have all freedom of choice removed. If a union has not been able to pursuade the employer to do business with it—I am looking at amendment No. 48—even then the Opposition want unions to stitch up among themselves who should or should not be allowed to join. Recognition and spheres of influence are just a pretext for unions to deny choice to union members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister two questions. First, does he believe in the principle of freedom of association? Secondly, if he does, does he accept that it works both ways?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had all these arguments about the closed shop, which were resisted by Opposition Members using exactly the arguments that they have used in the Committee today. Now even Opposition Members acknowledge, at least in their public statements, that the abolition of the closed shop is long overdue. These arguments have been gone over in Committees such as this in the House and, in the end, hon. Members have acknowledged that the individual has the right of choice in these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>124</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not imagine that the Minister would be very enthusiastic about amendment No. 48, but I am not sure why he is so dismissive of our amendment relating to the single union agreement. Will he accept that it is not just Opposition Members who are putting these arguments forward but a good many people in companies up and down the land? Why is he so opposed to this amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A single-union agreement is nothing more than the result of an employer's decision to negotiate with one union and one union only. It has no effect on the individual's right to join the union of his choice, but the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) is refusing to make that distinction. The hon. Lady is right in saying that she is not the only person to advance that argument: her hon. Friends and others have said the same. Apocalyptic scenarios have been developed. The hon. Member for Wallasey described me as an anarchist. In the past seven days I have been described as a socialist, a Maoist and a right-wing Thatcherite. I can only conclude that we are providing something of a balanced ticket in our policies. The images presented by the hon. Lady of mass defections from recognised single unions when the Bridlington iron curtain goes are simply not credible. Instability and collapse in the work place are unlikely to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If an employer decides to recognise a union, he chooses one that he feels he can do business with, but he is hardly likely to feel that it meets that description if its members are prepared to leave it in droves at the first opportunity. When Nissan signed its single-union deal with the AUEW it explained that that was the union
	<br><blockquote><p>"we felt the majority of our employees would want to join"</p></blockquote>
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady, the Member for Gateshead, East spoke eloquently about the importance of Japanese firms and I shall not detain the Committee by referring her to Mr. Gill and others who have been less enthusiastic about inward investment and single-union agreements. But if a few individual employees at Nissan who have, for example, hitherto been AEEU members decide they want to join another union when the clause becomes law, what would the consequences be? They might decide that another union offers them better insurance deals or that they have a personal commitment to it. What is wrong with that? Why should they be prevented from joining the union of their choice by the TUC, the Labour party, their employer or anyone else? I do not accept that the clause would undermine single-union agreements. Where employers wish to negotiate or to continue with agreements of this kind, they will be free to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East, mentioned the CBI and various other people have been mentioned on the employers' side. The fact is that most employers recognise that. As has been pointed out, in the engineering industry there are more single-union agreements than anywhere else. The Engineering Employers Federation said, about this and the impact of the Bridlington rules, in response to our Green Paper proposal:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The EEF will not mourn the demise of the Bridlington agreement We do not believe that its passage will create major inter-union rivalries, neither do we believe that individual employees will chop and change from one union to another."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>125</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister also recognise that, in its response to the Green Paper, the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Employers would not benefit from a plethora of unions all competing for membership and, more importantly, clamouring to be recognised by the employer for the purpose of collective bargaining and statutory entitlements. This proposal is more likely to lead to disruptive inter-union arguments which would seriously damage production.?"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember it well, but the hon. Lady shows little faith in the ability of trade unions to persuade people to remain in their membership or the ability of employers to take a reasonable decision on recognition. Nothing in the Bill prevents employers from making their own judgements in accordance with local circumstances as to whom they should or should not recognise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Wallasey has intervened however, because I should like to come to some of the points she made in her speech. She expressed her irritation that Bridlington was to be abolished by the clause because the town had been her birthplace—at a date somewhat later than the agreement itself of course. I can offer her one consolation. I understand that Bridlington won a British Tourist Board award a few years ago as one of the country's leading seaside resorts. That is a much greater claim to fame than having been the birthplace of the Bridlington rules and one which is far more likely to create employment opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said there was no evidence of any outrage over the Bridlington rules and asked who the people were who were calling for change. I refer her to 	<i>The Times</i> of 9 May 1991 which quotes Mr. Bill Morris, the TGWU's deputy secretary general as he was at that time. Bill Morris told 	<i>The Times</i> that the principles had served the movement well, but that
	<br><blockquote><p>"today when we are about choice and opportunity for the individual there is no choice or opportunity within them".</p></blockquote>
Mr. Morris told the 	<i>Financial Times</i> on the same day that events in the past few years had shown that the Bridlington rules were
	<br><blockquote><p>"ripe for review.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"He said they should be examined independently by an impartial expert who could suggest changes to bring them up to date."</p></blockquote>
I should say that I am independent of Mr. Morris and well served by experts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the remarks of Bill Morris have been taken out of context? He was referring to a proposal to review the workings of the Bridlington rules as a part of the TUC 2000 exercise when he talked about that review and in no way during his statement did he express a wish or view that the Bridlington arrangements should be scrapped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quoted Mr. Morris expressing a view that today the unions are about "choice and opportunity". How the hon. Lady could square that statement with one that he was not seeking a review to get rid of the rules, I do not know. Is not the Committee fascinated that the hon. Lady said there was no evidence of anyone calling for change? Yet she seems to have a piece of paper in front of her which gives her the line to take on Mr. Bill Morris's call for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we can refresh the hon. Lady's memory with the article which appeared in the 	<i>Sunday Times</i> of 6 September 1992. Mr. Gavin Laird said:
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>126</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sadly, history has repeated itself this year with a motion containing a thinly veiled attack on single-union agreements."</p></blockquote>
He was referring to the last TUC conference.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Another motion calls for the maintenance of the so-called 'Bridlington' rules that govern relations between unions. Notwithstanding the fact that under new government proposals these rules become illegal, they are outdated and irrelevant to modern industrial relations."</p></blockquote>
In the same article, goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Only if unions are able to meet the demands of the membership and reflect its aspirations will the future of trade unionism be secured. Employees must have the freedom to join a union of their choice: unions cannot be exempt from people's freedom of choice. The only real future in an ever more competitive environment is to offer a worthwhile, quality service."</p></blockquote>

The hon. Lady asked for examples of people calling for change. Gavin Laird is an example and a very fine example of a progressive element in the trade union movement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister quotes Gavin Laird and Bill Morris. Can he point out where any of these supporters said that what is required to make the change is fresh legislation? Does he agree that all the people who have spoken in support of change, including Opposition members, believe that the best way to do it is by changing regulation within a self-regulated TUC?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman astonishes me; he has just stood on his head. The whole of his speech was about what an undesirable thing this was. Now he is saying that it is all right if the TUC does it on its own. In so doing, the hon. Gentleman gives the game away. The reason why the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues wish to defend the Bridlington principles is that it is a job for the TUC. By saying that it would be acceptable if this was done by the TUC, the hon. Gentleman has given the game away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is missing the point. Clearly, there are examples of self-regulatory bodies that have worked, which have been instituted by all sorts of people, including the Government. I participated in an interesting debate on that subject only last night. The point about the TUC goes to the root of the Opposition's arguments, because the role of the TUC or the unions, as independent organs separate from the state, is critical. Has the Minister any evidence of people arguing for legislation in this area, as distinct from independent organisations operating within their own rule books?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not read out the entire article by Gavin Laird, but I shall happily give it to the hon. Gentleman. I shall not repeat the quotes at length, but I do not see how it is possible to argue that someone who writes that employees must have the freedom to join a union of their choice, refers to the Government's decision to make the rules illegal and describes those rules as
	<br><blockquote><p>"outdated and irrelevant to modern industrial relations"</p></blockquote>
does not support a legislative route. There is nothing in the article to substantiate the hon. Gentleman's view, but a great deal to substantiate the view held by Conservative Members.

The hon. Member for Wallasey made an excellent speech, which helped to advance the Government's case.

She cited the example of the MCC and asked why the MCC should not be governed by the rules that apply here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister should observe the rules that apply to all hon. Members. He should address the Chair and not the back of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox. The hon. Lady argued that if the MCC was entitled to exclude half the membership, trade unions should enjoy the same privileges. But the hon. Lady forgets that trade unions are not like the MCC. They are organisations which enjoy special privileges in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So does the MCC.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The privileges that the MCC enjoys are not privileges passed by the House in statute. They are privileges that the MCC has earned for itself. The privileges that trade unions enjoy come from immunities enshrined in statute. Unlike any other organisation, trade unions, are protected when they act in restraint of trade, a freedom which the MCC would envy them, because it was taken to court for acting in restraint of trade when it tried to prevent cricketers from going to South Africa. It had none of the privileges that trade unions have in that respect.

The hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) referred to recognition. I was genuinely puzzled by his statement, because he appeared to say that the Bill would prevent people from being able to demand recognition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not talking about trade union barons. I was talking about discipline at shop floor level and the problem that would arise if one member, who did not like the views that had been expressed collectively could opt from one to the other. That would undermine the discipline and team effort that employers are seeking with trade unions in their places of work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I misunderstood what the hon. Gentleman was saying. I thought he was arguing that groups of workers could break away and then demand recognition from the employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made the further point to the Minister that if groups of workers were able to relinquish their trade union membership and collectively form another trade union or organisation, it would undermine the stability of an employer, because those workers would be able to hold the rest to ransom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled. The hon. Gentleman will know that the last Labour Government introduced the 1975 Act that gave the right to recognition to certain trade unions. The very thing that the hon. Gentleman complains about was provided for in statute by the last Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have good news for him, however. A Conservative Government repealed that Act in 1980, so his fears about people being able to demand recognition and how undesirable and dislocating it would be have been removed by the action of the Conservative Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the point that I raised. It is exactly the same point that Mr. Olner is making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not refer to other members of the Committee by name, except me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise. Perhaps I shall get used to the procedure before I leave the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not answer the point that I made, which is now being made again. It is not always an outside organisation that is seeking recognition. It could be that, within a company with multi-union recognition, people transfer from one union recognised within their agreement to another. Does the Minister not accept that it would be totally impractical, if people in one section had transferred from one union to another, for the company to believe that the original union would continue to offer them recognition? Surely it would not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not. I agree with Mr. Gavin Laird that unions should be about attracting members and providing services for them, not about trade union leaders deciding which union is appropriate for the membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston gave a somewhat one-sided account of the Ford saga in Dundee. I refer him to the excellent article by Mr. Gavin Laird, who describes, in purple prose, what a disaster it was. His comments on the TUC were much more punishing than I should ever want to be in the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde very fairly and characteristically acknowledged that not everything went well over the Ford saga in Dundee and that some lessons had been learnt. I hope that one of the lessons is that the amendments are unnecessary and undesirable and that clause 11 would strike a blow for freedom of choice for individual union members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that all the single-union agreements since then have been reasonably successful and were well accepted by those employers and companies that entered into those deals? Can the Minister assure me that he is familiar with the single-union deal since then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is raising the issue of single-union agreements and whether they are bad or good. I agree that a number have been developed, despite opposition from some sections of the trade union movement. At issue here is whether the TUC should have the power to prevent people from joining certain unions, which is a separate issue from that of single-union agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that the hon. Gentleman made, in response to my intervention, related to his own union, USDAW, which sponsors him. He said that he was not aware of any USDAW members wishing to leave USDAW over Sunday trading to join the GMBATU. I ask him to consider his position. Here he is, an excellent Member of Parliament for a Scottish constituency—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Hon. Members</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give you your bottle of whisky later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>129</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will take the whisky now, before I finish the sentence. His constitutents have no restrictions placed upon them, regarding their ability to shop on Sundays, by virtue of the law. There is no law in his constituency to prevent Sunday trading, yet the hon. Gentleman is sponsored by a union that is opposed to Sunday trading. The hon. Gentleman is a Member of Parliament, whose constituents are not constrained on Sunday trading, in a union whose members were opposed to the union's opposition to Sunday trading and who wished to join another union which reflected their views. They were prevented from doing so. The hon. Gentleman said that he was not aware of that. Paragraph 6.10 of the Green Paper spells out—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I did not know any USDAW members who wished to work on Sundays unless they were paid double time and had full workers' protection. I genuinely do not know any USDAW workers who want to work on Sundays, nor any who wish to switch unions. That is a personal point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we can proceed on the basis that the hon. Gentleman has to know personally every one of the members for the issue to be treated seriously. The Green Paper says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There were members prevented from transfering from USDAW to the GMB by the application, at the request of USDAW, of the rules contained in the Bridlington principles.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As a result they were locked into a union with whose policy on an important issue of conscience they fundamentally disagreed."</p></blockquote>
I asked the hon. Gentleman repeatedly if he agreed with that. If he does, how on earth can he square his union's policy position on this by arguing that it is a matter of conscience? He is saying that Sunday trading is a matter of conscience and that there should be a conscience clause as well as a double-time rate. That is his union's policy. But at the same time he is saying to the Committee that it is perfectly all right for people to be forced, by the retention of this clause, to join this union against their conscience and their wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is over-elaborating when he stresses the phrase "against their wishes". He knows very well the matter that I raised about a dispute among social workers in Strathclyde, where the full-time trade union officers told their members to go back to work. The members were so angry, because they were going back to work, that they wished to join another union and the Bridlington dispute was brought into play. Those workers were quite content to remain in their union after they had seen the error of their ways. Is the Minister saying that he would have liked the social workers to continue their strike? It was one of the longest disputes in the history of Scottish local government and at the end of the day it was resolved sensibly. That is important in the context of USDAW workers wishing to join the GMB because of USDAW's opposition to Sunday trading. In England it is illegal to work on Sunday and therefore USDAW is preventing illegal action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot slide out of it like that. I shall not detain the Committee for much longer on this point, but the hon. Gentleman cannot argue that constituents who are members of USDAW—there must be some apart from himself—and enjoy the freedom
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>130</span>
to shop on Sundays north of the border should not be allowed to leave USDAW for another union because they oppose USDAW's policy. That policy reflects the circumstances south of the border and not their personal convictions. If we were to accept the amendments the freedom provided in the clause would be destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde is a reasonable man. In his heart of hearts he must know that he is wrong on this and I hope that he will still feel able to offer me the bottle of whisky—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman said that he would give "you" a bottle of whisky. That is me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a feeling, Mr. Knox, that you will be more able to get it from the hon. Gentleman than I am. I shall happily obey your ruling in that respect if the hon. Gentleman agrees to do the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the whisky will be forthcoming on the basis of what I said to the hon. Gentleman and that the hon. Lady's withdrawal of the amendments will also be forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will not be surprised to learn that I do not wish to withdraw the amendments. He must have been very stung by the accusations of Maoism and anarchy that were levelled at him by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey. He was keen to preserve his reputation for right-wing Thatcherism, which he did very convincingly in reply to our debate. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] That seems to please some of his hon. Friends, although perhaps not all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go through the arguments again because they have been well aired by both sides of the Committee and my hon. Friends have made many worthwhile points. I am surprised that the Minister was not more sympathetic to the category of person described by my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton—vexatious and undisciplined members. I should have thought that a Government who were trying to get the Maastricht Bill through the House would be particularly sympathetic to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that we have made many reasonable comments and that the Minister has not responded to the feeling in industry about some of the consequences of the clause. The Minister may be forced to think again as a result of its implementation, because not only trade unions, but industry, too, will make many further representations to him on the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 33, in page 22, line 19, leave out "a union" and insert "an independent trade union".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief, partly because the matter has been touched on in exchanges between the Minister and one of my hon. Friends earlier and partly because it is a probing amendment which tries to obtain clarification from the Government about the meaning behind the phrase that we seek to amend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2)(c) permits the organisation of a union which is restricted to the employees of a certain employer. We wonder whether the Government intend to offer advantages to house or company unions rather than to independent unions. That is why we tabled our amendment to insert the word "independent".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The remainder of the clause seems to refer to all trade unions, but subsection (2)(c) seems to offer legitimacy to a union in the specific situation which favours company unions. Indeed, to avoid a preference for one type of union or another, it would have been better if the Government had worded the clause differently, to ensure that it meant all unions, including independent unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In raising this matter, I am also influenced by the requirements of the various standards of the International Labour Organisation, which Opposition Members feel strongly about and lay great store by. Article 2 of the 1949 ILO convention guarantees workers' and employers' organisations freedom from interference by each other, and indeed specifically bans financial support or other acts that have the object of putting workers' unions under the control of employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same ILO standard of independence is enshrined in the British legislation that we know as the 1992 Act and also relates to the certificate given by the certification officer. Provisions in previous legislation have always been restricted so as not to favour non-independent unions. The clause does not seem to bother to do that and we are trying to find out whether that was the Government's intention or whether it is simply the way in which the Bill was drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to receiving reassurance from the Minister on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I can reassure the hon. Lady in that respect. I shall first deal with her point about the ILO. Certainly the Government believe that nothing in the Bill, or indeed in general employment law, contravenes any ILO convention ratified by the UK. Where observations have been made to the ILO, we have always responded, and shall continue to respond when called upon to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Lady that no special privileges are being granted here. I think that everyone will agree that it is sensible that an association which recruits only within a certain employer should not have to accept into membership employees of another possibly rival employer. I am sure that no one would suggest that the National Westminster staff association, for example, should have to accept employees of Barclays bank into membership. The independence or otherwise of the staff association in question is not relevant. To be protected by the clause, the association will have to be a trade union
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>132</span>
in the terms of section 1 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Its independence as defined in section 5 of that Act is beside the point. It may indeed be that an association is not truly independent, that it was set up and even funded by the employer in question and that the employees are entirely happy with this arrangement, and I can see no good reason why such associations should be any less protected from having to accept inappropriate applicants into membership than trade unions generally. Therefore, the clause puts them on—I hate the term "level playing field", because it is used so often—an even basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it was a probing amendment and I hope that the hon. Lady will feel able to seek to withdraw it on the basis of the assurances that I have given her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be a little more specific and say that nothing in the clause would adversely affect the standing of independent trade unions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am fairly certain that that is the position and I am advised by invisible sources that that is the position. I would be very happy to give the hon. Lady an undertaking to look at that matter carefully and to come back to the Committee if there is any matter which has escaped my attention or that of my officials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's reassurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 22, line 29, leave out from "if to end of line 36 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is lawful within the general law applying to unincorporated associations.".</p></blockquote>
This amendment relates to a comment that the Minister made in response to the debate on the previous amendment when he talked about the ILO convention and the fact that he did not see anything in the Bill that would be at variance with the ILO standards or the ILO agreements of which we are part. We feel that there is some concern, which is why we have tabled the amendment. The clause may infringe some of the ILO provisions about freedom of association by interpreting it in a rather restrictive manner. It is not just the ILO, important though that is, it is also the Council of Europe social contract of 1961, the European convention on human rights and, although the Government will not accept this, the European Community social charter. None the less, although the European social charter is slightly weaker, it is very much in line with the ILO standards and the ILO convention of which we are part. We have a deep commitment to the ILO convention and we do not want to see anything in the Bill which would contradict the international commitment into which we have entered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that there are other reasons why unions might want to restrict membership, which would be allowed by the ILO convention but would not be covered by the Bill. It is a particular problem for British trade unions because the constitutions of most member countries of the Community would automatically enshrine freedom of association and the other aspects of the ILO convention to which I have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>133</span>
The Government should be prepared, at least, to give an assurance that they will look at this part of the Bill carefully and see whether it is fully compatible with ILO standards and the convention. If there is any risk of its not being so, perhaps the Minister will inform the Committee and table an amendment to the Bill to make sure that it is consistent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our reading of the Bill is that this part is over-restrictive and could be in violation of ILO standards. For that reason I should be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot speak for the ILO: I can only speak for the Government and reiterate what I said to the hon. Lady, which is that we know of nothing in the Bill which contravenes any ILO convention that has been ratified by the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, this amendment is unacceptable for a number of reasons. The hon. Lady clearly did not table it with this in mind, but it is what I would describe as a "wrecking amendment". It creates some difficulties for clause 11 which gives individuals the right to join the union of their choice. It is not an unfettered right. We recognise that unions may place entirely legitimate restrictions on their membership; for example, in terms of trade, occupation or qualifications, to ensure that their members enjoy a commonality of interest. It is no part of our intention to force trade unions to accept as members people who have no common interest with existing members. There are restrictions on membership which could not be tolerated and which clause 11 does not allow. It cannot be right to allow trade unions to refuse membership to people because they have worked for particular employers or because they belong to a particular trade union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are exactly the kinds of restrictions that the Bridlington principles put on trade union members—restrictions which do not take account of individual wishes. If the amendment were to be carried it would undermine clause 11 completely and Bridlington would prevail. We have already had that debate in respect of the previous amendment. It would be extraordinary if
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>134</span>
the effect of this amendment would be that the TGWU could refuse membership to anyone who had never worked at Nissan, provided that its rule book said so, or that the GMBATU could expel anyone who had ever belonged to the AEEU if its rule book said so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the hon. Lady would not want that to be the position, but that would be the effect. On the basis of what I said about the ILO and what I indicated earlier, I hope that she will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is making the amendment sound rather more interesting than it was intended to be, and even devious. I hope he accepts that. I am partly reassured, but I would welcome from the Minister a clear commitment that if something is found in the Bill, particularly at this point, which is in contradiction of ILO standards and the ILO convention, which we have ratified, he will undertake to bring some suitable amendments himself on Report or at some later stage so that there would be no inconsistency with our international obligations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Lady a commitment in respect of a hypothetical situation. All that I can say is that I know of no reason why anything in this Bill should put us in conflict with any of the ILO conventions which we have ratified. But if the hon. Lady is aware of any concern, naturally I would be very happy to consider any representations that she wants to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that, we may wish to come back to this later. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
