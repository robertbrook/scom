	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [25 June],</i> No. 82, in page 1, line 14, leave out 'associated' and insert
	<br><q><p>'consequential environmental and coastal protection'.—	<i>[Mr. Murphy.]</i></p></q></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had half-expected Mr. Martin or Mr. Winterton to be in the chair, so it is an added pleasure that you, Mr. Hogg, are making what I take to be a surprise visit—it is all the more welcome for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a need to tighten the wording of subsection (1)(b) by removing the word "associated", which is far too loose for the proper conduct of parliamentary business involving items of public expenditure, and replacing it with the purposive and descriptive phrase, to which I should have thought that we could all agree,
	<br><q><p>"consequential environmental and coastal protection".</p></q>
The need to tighten the definitions should have become apparent during last week's proceedings. The Government's cost calculations are far too loose and freewheeling in that they allow alterations. I shall give the Minister the calculations that I think should have been in the financial update given to us last week, and which were referred to as a comparison of cost figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the weekend, my constituents, to whom I supplied copies of the financial memorandum, have written to me about the cost calculations. I think the Committee is agreed that the Minister's figure of £167.4 million refers to the barrage package, which is the barrage plus the works that must be carried out and without which there could be no barrage—for exampe, environmental and coastal protection works. The figure is based on the hypothesis that construction of the barrage will start in 1993 and finish in 1998 or 1999. In the view of my constituents, the figure of £167.4 million should read £185.1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my constituents are considerably more expert on such matters than I, and we believe that the Government have forgotten about £9 million of additional expediture. It was referred to in January in the Secretary of State's own Stoner report on the cost of providing proper protection to properties, principally on the west bank of the river Taff. Mention of the west bank reminds me of the Israeli Labour party's astonishing performance last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The additional £9 million was referred to in January 1992—after the Second Reading in November 1991. At that time, Mr. Nicholas Bennett was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State—for your future reference, Mr. Hogg, the new incumbent prefers to be called the Parliamentary Secretary. The additional £9 million referred to in paragraph 7 (iii) of the Stoner report does not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>76</span>
appear to have been included in the cost update provided last Thursday and I should be happy if the Minister would comment on that. The additional £9 million makes a considerable difference, partly because it is a snapshot figure and, therefore, lower than the equivalent outturn figure which is based on a hypothetical construction period from 1993 to 1998
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my constituents and I are right, the figure of £9 million in paragraph 7 (iii) of the Stoner report will have to be updated. On pages 9 and 10, Mr. Stoner states that the number of properties that will require remedial work has increased from the 1,650 envisaged before the report was published in January 1992, to 5,695. It will cost a lot more to remedy rising damp or the ingress of water to basements in 5,695 properties than it would have cost in only 1,500 or so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the Welsh Office machine has omitted the £9 million in Stoner; if the figure were set on an outturn basis, it would probably be closer to £11 million. I put it at £10 million to keep it at round figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the Government accept—it was in the Minister's statement—that they have also omitted another £6 million or £7 million, to be spent by private treaty on so-called mitigation works, whether on Wentlooge levels or further away in the constituency of the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Evans) on the Caldicot levels—it depends where the Government get the best deal. To allow a comparison, on an outturn basis, I am adding £7 million, to use round figures, for the so-called mitigation works referred to as part of the ministerial intention, but taken out by the Select Committee, and to be added back in by the Welsh Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Stoner report, there is a minor item of expenditure which may be between £500,000 and £1 million for remedial drainage works to be carried out by Cardiff city council but, plainly, to be charged to Cardiff Bay development corporation. That, too, is on page 9 of the Stoner report, at paragraph 7ii. It gives a cost of £440,000 for the work, but, on an outturn basis, I think that it could be £750,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also what I allege is a phoney figure on the second material page of the notes for Members. The figure of £14.80 million, for diversion and modification of sewers, was given in the financial memorandum on Second Reading last November. In January this year, that figure was also given in the Stoner report as £14 million, on a snapshot basis. It is bizarre that the Minister is claiming that that figure is not touched by converting it to an outturn basis, as some of the work has already been carried out by the council and Welsh Water, such as adjustments to the Cogan outfall and sewer diversions made necessary by the construction of the peripheral distributor road. Mr. Roy Stoner, the Secretary of State's adviser, did not seem to be aware of that in January this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have added £2 million to arrive at a proper figure rather than at a fiddled, Robert Maxwell pension fund type figure which is suggested by the mysterious similarity between the £14.80 million and £14 million figures, which are given in spite of the changes in prices since November 1988 and since October 1991. I have added £17.7 million to the £167.4 million outturn figure and that totals £185.1 million. In my opinion and in the opinion of my expert constituents, that is the true cost of the barrage and of, not "associated" works, to use the Bill's loose wording, but of
	<br><q><p>"consequential environmental and coastal protection", to use the tighter and more precise phrase used in the amendment.</p></q>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>77</span>
The incredibly increased cost of £185·1 million was referred to in an outstandingly wise letter, published in the 	<i>South Wales Echo</i> on Friday, I think by a constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones). It mentioned that the cost of the barrage was £45 million in 1986, rising to £61·5 million in the financial memorandum of the original Bill in December 1987, to £85 million in the second Bill in 1988, to £113 million in 1989, to £125 million in 1990, to £152 million in 1991, and finally to £167 million. In my opinion, assuming work starts in 1993, the cost outturn will be £185·1 million. The cost has risen from £45 million on a snapshot basis in 1986 to—in my opinion—£1851 million on a cost outturn basis. That makes clear the need for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Hon. Gentleman is repeating himself. I am sure that he wants to reinforce the point, as he is entitled to do, but I have heard the figure of £1851 million so often that I am convinced of it myself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was on the point of resuming my seat, as you would have seen had you stayed your patience, Mr. Hogg. I do not see any purpose in repeating the figure again even though you have rather spoilt my peroration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan), I welcome you, Mr. Hogg, to the Chair. I know that you will greatly aid our deliberations and we look forward to your continued presence. That might be the limit of the extent to which I can agree with what the hon. Member for Cardiff, West said. He indulged in his usual practice of inventing a figure and squaring it further to cloud the waters around the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £9 million referred to in the Stoner report is an additional cost for the worst possible situation mentioned in the Hydrotechnica report. All the costs associated with the most likely case on groundwater are included in the £167·4 million. The expenditure of £440,000 is best illustrated by quoting page 9 of the Stoner report:
	<br><q><p>"The total cost involved in these measures is £440,000 but it could be argued that since these areas are inadequately drained at the moment, the whole charge concerned with land drainage should not fall upon the Barrage project."</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Page 10 of the Stoner report says that the costs of surveying and carrying out remedial work to the properties
	<br><q><p>"now amount to £23.52 million having risen from £14.43 million."</p></q>
If the Minister refers to his financial update of last Thursday, he will see that in the related expenditure table, the groundwater cost is put at £14.43 million. That is before the addition of the £9.09 million. The Secretary of State said that he accepted the Stoner report in its entirety. He cannot be saying that the £14.43 million—the pre-Stoner report figure which he has included in his cost update—is the only figure and that the £9 million has disappeared into thin air. It is stated plainly that it is additional to the £14.43 million in his related expenditure table.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned page 10 of the Stoner report. If he has read that page fully he will have seen that the total of the extra remedial work—in the extreme case—would be £9.09 million. That is, as I said, the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>78</span>
worst possible case, whereas the most likely case has been included in the £167.4 million—the figures I gave last Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There remains a possibility of alternative mitigation measures, which I think, will be discussed more properly when we debate amendments Nos. 120, 91 and 92 later this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) that the Government take very seriously the responsibility to protect the coast and the environment and I suggest that the amendment is unnecessary. As to removing vagueness from clause 1, as suggested by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West, I should point out that clause 1 is quite specific. It confers authority to execute only those works specified in schedule 1. The barrage and the outer harbour are listed in clause 1(1)(a). It follows, therefore, that the associated structures are the Penarth head promenade and the breasting dolphins. The breasting dolphins are neither environmental nor coastal protection, but are for the protection of shipping. I contend that the amendment would effectively rule out those breasting dolphins. There is nothing vague about the clause and I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Opposition, Mr. Hogg, I welcome you to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West has made some valuable general points, but in view of what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 120, in page 2, line 24, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'or for the purposes of developing or conserving flora or fauna'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 91, in clause 2, Page 2, line 44, at end insert', averting displacement of,'.</p>
	<p>No 92, in clause 2, page 3, line 4, after 'conserve', add the words 'and avert displacement of.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall return to this matter later, but I wish briefly to introduce the topic of how the Government intend to provide the mitigation works that they have said they will provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to issues which we have not yet touched, except very briefly in the sittings motion debate, when the Minister hurried over them at a rate of knots. He replied to the sittings motion debate at the speed of the fastest model train in the train set in his attic, so that nobody would understand what he was talking about. The amendments relate to the Government's intentions with regard to their environmental obligations under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to consider the matter in great detail this morning because there may be other more suitable opportunities, but since the Minister went past the points—if I may put it that way—several times when he dealt with this matter in reply to the sittings motion on Tuesday last week, we should perhaps press him further for a slightly more considered reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 (6) refers to the services that the barrage will provide, which will be, in the main,
	<br><q><p>"to facilitate use by pleasure craft or other vessels or for water sports or other open-air recreational activities."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>79</span>
We argue that it is also necessary to refer to the purposes of developing or conserving flora and fauna. The amendment is not hostile to the Government's intentions. The Government have said elsewhere in the Bill that they will create at least one artificial island in the inland bay. They have also raised the question of mitigation works outside the bay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mitigation works come in all forms. For example, a duck reserve might be set up within the inland bay. Although that would not provide a habitat for our feathered friends who are there now, it would show that the development corporation is not a philistine organisation that is unaware of its environmental obligations. The corporation intends to provide two forms of compensatory works both inside and outside the bay. Those works will cost money and so must be covered in the Bill. I am surprised that we have no information on how the corporation will execute those powers. It is all very well to refer to pleasure craft, but how will they be covered by the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 91 and 92 would widen the duty of the Cardiff Bay development corporation to "avert displacement of flora and fauna. The Government have an undertaking with the Countryside Council for Wales to make the Bill more palatable to nature conservation interests. In return, the Countryside Council for Wales undertook to withdraw the petition made by its parent body, the Nature Conservancy Council for Wales, at the time of the private Bill. The Countryside Council for Wales decided that it would prefer a side agreement with the Government to a petition against the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The friendly amendments are in line with the Government's aim to protect birds and to assist mitigation works elsewhere. Can the Minister say when he is likely to have details of those mitigation works? Where are the islands that are to be created mentioned in the Bill? What is to be done for the birds? The amendments cover those topics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be many opportunites for debating this fraught issue, but I should like to have the Minister's observations now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following my hon. Friend's argument on these probing amendments. Is he suggesting that after the Bill is enacted there should be no change in the flora or fauna within the bay?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people would like to see an improvement, which would involve some change, but the wording of the amendment suggests that there should be no change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only a lawyer could answer that question, but the amendments are intended to be user, or Minister, friendly and to elicit the Minister's comments. In choosing the words "averting displacement of" I had in mind the works along the south Wales foreshore. Will the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and particularly the Countryside Council for Wales, regard them as satisfactory? It is not impossible to attract wading birds to an area. There were no bewick swans from Siberia in the area when Slimbridge was established in 1948, but, however the bush telegraph worked, one way or another, they began to arrive. We must have satisfactory alternatives for the wading birds, otherwise Britain will be in a difficult moral position when lecturing other countries in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>80</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has turned on to the positive aspect of the matter, but let me bring him back to the amendments. I am sure that no one would want to conserve the effect of spartina grass on the flora of part of the area, yet that would seem to be a consequence of the amendments. I presume that my hon. Friend is trying to target specific aspects that are worthy of conservation, rather than all flora and fauna, as I am sure that he agrees that some aspects of the bay are unattractive and not worthy of conservation in any sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more that the amendment is aimed at the conservation of the good aspects of the biomass and provision of habitat within Cardiff bay. As my hon. Friend rightly says, an invasion of spartina over the past 15 to 20 years has caused great difficulties for waders because it has introduced a new, exotic and possibly hostile element into the natural environment—spartina is natural, but it is an invader in many other senses. The purpose of the amendments is to elicit a response from the Minister who keeps dropping mysterious hints that mitigation works will be carried out to keep the Countryside Council for Wales on side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to know about that side agreement—there should be no shake-hands deals behind our backs while we are in the middle of parliamentary scrutiny. After all, the Countryside Council for Wales is a body nominated by the Secretary of State, although it has a set of statutory duties. We remember the sad history of the Nature Conservancy Council, which was slapped down and virtually eliminated because it took on the Secretary of State a few years ago. Now that we have a different set-up, we want to ensure that it can work in the open. Therefore, I should be pleased if the Minister would undertake to publish the letter and say what he intends to do to prevent the Countryside Council for Wales from changing its mind and petitioning against the Bill in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, West was asking for a carefully considered response to his questions, which I hope that I can give him. I may even have a pleasant surprise for him, because, as I suggested last week, I want to respond positively whenever I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The barrage will obviously cause a profound change in the type of water in Cardiff bay, with a consequential effect on the existing flora and fauna. It would be impossible for the corporation to avoid displacing the present flora and fauna as the amendments would require it to do. It was against the background of radical change that the corporation sought to provide a range of mitigation measures. Those included the fish pass, the design of which has been agreed and approved by the National Rivers Authority, the creation of freshwater habitats, which would be valuable to wildlife and the alternative feeding grounds at Wentlooge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative feeding grounds have now been removed from the Bill at the request of the Select Committee. Following its decision, discussions have taken place between the Welsh Office, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. Both the RSPB and the Countryside Council for Wales have indicated that they would prefer the exploration of alternative mitigation measures in the form of a bird reserve on the Gwent levels to reinstatement of the Wentlooge lagoon in the Bill. The development corporation has proposed a feasibility study
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>81</span>
to assess the suitability of the site. The corporation has consulted the Countryside Council for Wales and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds on the terms of the study. The corporation has also brought the proposal to the attention of the Land Authority for Wales. As a result, the feasibility study has now been commissioned jointly by the development corporation and the Land Authority for Wales. The outcome of the study will determine whether the Land Authority for Wales decides to use its powers to promote the scheme and apply for planning permission.

Opposition Members have asked about the costs of the mitigation measures. I am unable to give final figures until we have the outcome of the feasibility study in the autumn. However, I can tell the Committee that our intention is to keep the cost of the mitigation measures within the total of £5.7 million at 1991–92 prices that would have been spent on the Wentlooge lagoon. I shall report back to the House when I have firm information on the form of mitigation, its cost and our proposed method of funding. The House will then have the opportunity of considering this expenditure in the context of the supply estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The corporation intends to develop new wildlife habitats in the impounded lake and, as clause 2(4) provides, will consult with the appropriate environmental bodies in so doing. The corporation proposes to create freshwater habitats, which will be of value to wildlife. Those habitats include wetland areas at the bay edges and a refuge island at what is now Penarth flats.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the hon. Member for Cardiff, West that there is no side agreement with the Countryside Council for Wales. Before the Government introduced the Bill, consultation was held with the Countryside Council for Wales about mitigation measures for birds. The council made it clear that it wanted the Wentlooge lagoon to be retained in the Bill. However, given that the Select Committee removed the lagoon from the Bill, the Countryside Council for Wales has not pressed for its reinsertion. I understand that the council is happy with the new proposals that are being investigated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Cardiff, West raised the concept of islands within Cardiff Bay. We shall have an opportunity to discuss those islands more specifically when we consider amendments Nos. 114 and 116.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said demonstrates to the Committee that the Government and the corporation recognise the need to develop new wildlife habitats in the impounded bay and attach great importance to doing so. I urge the Committee to reject amendments Nos. 91 and 92, which frankly are unworkable.

As for amendment No. 120, I accept that there could be scope for nature development and conservation to be added to the list of purposes for which the ancilliary powers in clause 1(5) may be implemented. In passing, I note that implementation of amendment No. 119 would inhibit the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>82</span>
performance of the conservation function which amendment No. 120 would add to clause 1(6). However, the drafting of amendment No. 120 is not entirely appropriate for the clause. I have explained my opposition to amendment No. 119, but I am happy to undertake, in relation to amendment No. 120, that consideration will be given to moving an appropriately worded Government amendment later in the Committee's proceedings. Accordingly, I urge the hon. Member for Cardiff, West to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"(15) The Development Corporation shall consult the angling interests on the rivers Taff and Ely in respect of the design and execution of the works relating to fish passes in Work No. 1 of Schedule 1 to this Act.".</p></q>
I hope that the amendment will gain the support of the Minister, who seems to be in a reasonable mood this morning. At least, I hope that I shall encourage him to accept the principle, if not the wording, of the amendment. First, I declare an interest: I am the honorary president of the Merthyr anglers association; a thriving, successful local anglers association of working and retired working people. There are no lairds among our membership, nor any wealthy riparian owners. It is a popular, local association which has shown much interest and enterprise. It may be of interest to Conservative Members who represent constituencies along the Usk, that this working-class association has bought a stretch of the Usk; it has interested and vociferous views about an Usk bay barrage. There may be a future unholy alliance between wealthy landowners and the Merthyr anglers association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of the Taff to angling has grown and grown. A poignant consequence of pit closures and the decline in manufacturing in our valleys has been the clearing of the rivers. Merthyr Vale colliery, which stood on the banks of the Taff, used to contribute to the pollution of that river. The problems that that created disappeared as the pits closed. Other manufacturing concerns that used to pollute the river have, sadly, been closed, but one consequence of those closures is that the quality of the River Taff is improving and its potential for fishing is growing. The barrage, therefore, is causing considerable anxiety to those who have angling interests on the River Taff and the River Ely. Such has been the success in cleaning those rivers, despite enormous and continuing problems, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) referred, that the National Rivers Authority has said that the Taff is once again a salmon and sewin river. It is an exciting and fascinating development of considerable significance. I understand from the NRA that salmon and sea trout are also again colonising the River Ely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who hold angling interests on the River Taff and the River Ely have expressed their concern about fish passes and the ability of fish to move through them. We do not complain about the handling of those matters by the development corporation in its lively and active discussions over a long period. A measure of satisfaction has been achieved as a result of those discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The amendment does not suggest that the Cardiff Bay development corporation, or any other authority involved in the development of the bay and the barrage, have ridden roughshod over the views of anglers on the rivers, especially the River Taff. However, there is a strong case, given the problems that could occur, for the Bill to include a statutory right to consult angling interests on those two rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the attention of the Minister and the Committee to the interesting statements made by the NRA on the problems of fish passes. It states:
	<br><q><p>"The Lower Taff supports a variety of coarse fish"—as well as salmon and sewin—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"depending upon the maintenance of suitable water quality."</p></q>
The NRA's fear is that, from time to time, the blue-green lagae, which has been the subject of previous discussions, may cause the death of coarse fish and salmon. The NRA and the angling interests are anxious about these issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note with interest Government amendment No. 70, which covers the requirements of a deemed impoundment licence. Subparagraph (IV) deals with NRA anxieties about fishing. We should write into the Bill a statutory responsibility to consult with anglers about the two rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the boast of the development corporation and other promoters of the Bill that they have consulted widely and that they wish to consult widely. They claim that they do not wish to ride roughshod over other people's interests or anxieties. Clause 18 deals with the establishment of an advisory committee. But none of the clauses provides for a statutory right or responsibility to consult angling interest about the Taff and Ely rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition suggest that clause 1, which deals with the construction of fish passes, should provide for that responsibility. But other clauses that cover the operation of the barrage, or clause 18, could include such a provision. We seek a clear undertaking from the Minister to grant a statutory responsibility to consult angling interests. That request is reasonable and moderate, especially as the development corporation and other bodies claim that they wish to consult. The amendment is modelled on the Bill. I have taken the words from clause 2(4), which states:
	<br><q><p>"The Development Corporation shall consult the Countryside Council for Wales and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds".</p></q>
The principle of including in the Bill a responsibility to consult organisations is accepted. That should not be limited to great august national bodies, but extended to people who have a practical interest in what will happen to the Taff and Ely rivers as a result of the barrage, which will impound the water and thus create the necessity to build fish passes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The River Taff has exciting new potential as a fishing river for salmon and sewin. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West reminded me that there was almost a sewin industry in Cardiff in the 1840s. My wife comes from west Wales where sewin is a delicacy. I prefer it to salmon—I think that it has a finer taste. There is an opportunity to restore the River Taff through its new, exciting fish population. Angling is one of the most popular national sports in the country. The rights of anglers should be preserved and written into the Bill. If the Minister accepts the principle, it can be written into other clauses of the Bill—it does not have to be included in clause 1. It would help us to make progress if the Minister agreed to the principle of the amendment, which I am sure commands widespread support from the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly about the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) I have benefited in the past from his expertise and his advocacy of the fishermen of Wales. When I was a member of the Committee that considered the Water Bill, my hon. Friend's representations were helpful and valuable. My hon. Friend has a reputation for safeguarding anglers' interests in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that he would take heart from the sight that I witnessed at the weekend of anglers lined along the Bute west dock in my constituency. It bodes well for activities when the bay is filled with water of a quality and composition similar to that in Bute west dock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend means the Bute east dock. The Bute west dock was filled in 20 years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend is right and I thank him for his geographical correction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Large numbers of people from the angling fraternity, especially on fine weekends, took advantage of the improved quality of water from the river Taff coming through the dock feeder referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. The representations made by those of us who, right from the early days of consideration of the barrage's construction, have been worried about such matters, have led to just the sort of communication with the angling fraternity that my hon. Friend described. That relationship has been productive because great care has been taken to deal with practicalities. Amendment No. 108 would extend that cooperation throughout the construction period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our discussions last week, the Committee referred to the need for consideration for the people living in the area during the construction period. The great danger is that once construction is underway the engineers will push ahead—as engineers on major projects will—and ride roughshod over anything that lies in their path. That is the nature of the beast, in a manner of speaking. To an extent, it is the secret of their success. However, we must ensure that their progress does not destroy the environment in the short term, either for the people who live in that area or for the fish that might be driven away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support amendment No. 108 and urge the Minister to take on board the comments made both last week and today about the need for protection during the construction process. Such protection would win support from many local people who are worried about the impact of the engineering works. In addition, as my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has made clear, it would win sympathy and support from the angling fraternity, which has taken part in positive discussions with the county council and the development corporation. Those discussions have benefited all parties, and I hope that the Minister will make a positive response to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two additional points that need to be made and which have not been covered by my hon. Friends the Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney

and for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael). On page 61 of the National Rivers Authority document published in December 1991, the second paragraph states:
	<br><q><p>"The NRA takes the view that the barrage and the impoundment are likely to obstruct or delay salmonid migration and some mortalities resulting from algal blooms or increased predation may also occur."</p></q>
One of the purposes of the amendment is to ensure that the NRA's slightly chilling prediction about the barrage's impact on fish is not proved true. I hope that the Minister will consider a couple of matters that have not been raised so far. We are talking about two entirely separate sets of fishing interests. One is the now happily reverted, post-industrial phase of rivers in south Wales. I have a particular interest in the river Ely and, as the National Rivers authority Makes clear in its document, Salmonid fish have returned to that river only in the past two and a half years. That has caused great excitement at the Ely paper mills, which are alongside the river, and among people who live further upstream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reversion to the pre-industrial importance of salmonid fisheries has been going on for slightly longer in the river Taff, which runs through all four Cardiff constituencies. Even so, the National Rivers Authority has started to take a serious interest in the Rivers Taff and Ely only since the barrage proposal went live in 1986–87. Only in the past 18 months has a fish pass been constructed in Blackweir in—which my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central and I share a riparian constituency interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I saw the fish pass most recently on Friday afternoon when I was having my five-mile constitutional jog around Central park. A child of about 10 was inside the fish pass and being poked with sticks. I suppose that would be called a friendly game, although I do not think that it would have been very friendly to salmon had any been there. That fish pass was constructed in 1990 by the National Rivers Authority to assist the passage of the now returning sewin and salmon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case you, Mr. Hogg, do not know what a sewin is, it is the Welsh word for sea trout. It is used by non-Welsh speakers and Welsh speakers to emphasise that the fish is one of Wales's major delicacies. I believe that sea trout can also be caught in Scotland, but they do not sound so nice when they are called sea trout. I am sure that you, Mr. Hogg, will agree that the word sewin has a touch of Celtic magic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those rivers play a very important role in the regeneration of salmonid fisheries. There is anger among the angling community—here I must keep my diction clear—of the River Taff, who perceive that those who represent or are associated with the Conservative party attach more importance to the Usk barrage than to the Cardiff Bay barrage. It is unquestionable that the mood of Conservative Members towards the proposed Usk barrage has been affected by the social class of the anglers who use the river Usk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been approached by very senior figures in the Conservative party who have tried to solicit my opposition to the Usk barrage. I have said to them, "Yes, of course I'll support you. Will you support me in my opposition to the Cardiff Bay barrage?" They have replied, "Oh, no, no. The Cardiff Bay barrage is not really that important." I have
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>86</span>
asked, "What do you mean, it is not really that important? I shall resist the temptation to say that they regarded the Cardiff Bay barrage as a completely different kettle offish. It is regrettable that, when a barrage is deemed to affect the holidaying habits or the hobbies of the upper classes, a mood of opposition can easily be communicated to the senior ranks of the Conservative party. It is unlikely that you, Mr. Hogg, would attend a house party in the Cotswolds or a Mayfair soiree, but were you to do so and say, "Oh, I'm going to spend the weekend fishing on the River Taff—a newly regenerating river which was closely associated previously with industry—it would not go down well and you would be dropped like a hot brick. If, however, you were to say that you were going fishing on the River Usk that weekend, you would be regarded as a very marketable commodity, as the guests would assume that you knew the right people and had the right connections.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I hope that anglers in Merthyr who have interest in and access to the river Usk will be invited to those Cotswold parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend, or perhaps it should be the other way round and people who go to house parties in the Cotswolds should be invited to the homes of anglers in Merthyr.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are irritated because there is no difference in the fishing importance of the two rivers. Before industrialisation in south Wales, the Taff was the main sewin river and the Usk was the main salmon river. The Taff is much shorter than the Usk and partly due to its length, it has less capacity to carry salmon. The Usk is 100 miles long and the Taff is no more than 35 miles long. The continuous torrent phase of the Taff—its primary geographical characteristic—made it the gret sewin river of south Wales before industrialisation in the 1830s and 1840s, which led to the construction of the Bute east and west dock about which my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth spoke earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Usk barrage is regarded as damaging to the hobbies of important people, but the anglers who are affected by the Cardiff bay barrage are not regarded as significant because they are not part of the establishment—the people who have country cottages in the vale of Usk and who have brought land and moved there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hypocritical of the Government to claim that they have an interest in the environment when they mean that they have a great deal of interest in the environment if they feel the hot breath of anglers from the upper classes. The upper classes predominate the ownership of fishing rights on the River Usk—there are a few honourable exceptions—and that is why I was lobbied by senior Tories about the Usk bay barrage. They would not support me or any Opposition Members on the barrage that would block the passage of salmonid fish in the Rivers Taff and Ely, because those rivers are not regarded as having any sex appeal to people who go to house parties of the kind to which I referred earlier. That is wrong. There is no chance of a classless society when the Government hypocritically try to stop one barrage and give massive support to another one through the Whip, guillotines and all the other parliamentary devices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want angling interests to be consulted consistently, regardless of which salmonid fishery river is involved. We are not happy with this Bill and the Bill that has just gone to the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>87</span>
The senior Tory who lobbied me about the Usk barrage said, "The Usk is a wholly different river. The size of the barrage means that at low tide, the outgoing salmon have to make a flying leap." The Usk is further up the Bristol channel than the Taff, but that makes a difference in drop of no more than 7.5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A young salmon with an instinctive urge to swim across the Atlantic, who swims down the River Usk and is about to go over the top of the sluice has no way of knowing whether it is low tide on the other side, a concern which led the NRA to refer to "increased predation"—the creation of packed lunches for cormorants. The salmon goes over the top of the barrage on its outward migration to the Sargasso sea. I speak with great trepidation on these matters because the only hon. Member with an ecology degree is my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central, who is sitting in front of me. I think that salmon emigrate to the Sargasso sea.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Eels do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorry. Wherever salmon emigrate to, when they go over the top of the barrage, it does not matter to them whether there is a 42 feet or a 48 feet drop on the other side. They will land with an awful wallop in a pool of water and they will be dizzy. People think that it is amusing. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central would correct me if I was wrong. The other side of the barrage would rapidly become a known place for goosanders, cormorants, herons and other predators of young fish, who would say, "We need do nothing except sit here, waiting for the salmon to come down. Wallop! They will hit the shallow water at low tide and for an hour and a half they will come to the surface, swimming in a daze. We can pick them off as we like." Other predators do that, such as the dolphins at the entrance to the River Teifi, when the salmon are on their migratory run. The dolphins toss the salmon out of the water with their noses and catch them on the way down—it is amazing. Heron, cormorants, goosanders and other predators of salmon would be able to do exactly the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is straying a little from the amendment, which deals with consulting the angling interests. There are no proposals to consult the salmon. I hope that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the advice of the dolphins, Mr. Hogg, because they are the cleverest at such things. The Government have not treated the anglers of migratory salmonid fish who are interested in the Cardiff bay barrage in the same way as they have treated anglers interested in the Usk barrage. That point is clearly established and the Minister will have to defend the positions of the Welsh Office and the Tory party. The Government will also have to consult the coarse fish anglers who will fish in the lake. The NRA's document refers to the problem of dry weather, which produces low flows of water. The barrage will produce a large lake, which will need to be stocked with a lot of fish to provide reasonable sport for coarse fish anglers. There cannot be a couple of hundred fish in a lake of that size because the human race is not clever enough to catch fish unless there are plenty of them. The estimate given by the NRA is that about 1 million coarse fish are needed in a lake of that size to give anglers a sporting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>88</span>
chance. If, every five or six years, there were to be a dry summer—such as 1976, 1984, 1990 and, to a lesser extent, 1991—blue-green algae might develop late in the summer. Many fish could die and it would be unbelievably expensive to restock 800,000 fish. Page 61 of the NRA's document refers to
	<br><q><p>"the substantial kills of coarse fish".</p></q>
Without the coarse fish there is no chance of controlling the midges. The 11 billion midges that will be around in the summer will be eaten by the coarse fish—that is an ideal control mechanism. When there is a drought—usually once every five to 10 years—there will be a low flow and a high level of nutrients in the water. By late July and August there will be blue-green algae instead of green algae, and there will be massive fish kills as the oxygen level crashes with the algal blooms die. That will be a big problem. There will have to be consultation with the coarse fish anglers around the bay. Without them and, therefore, some promise of restocking after major fish kills, there is no chance of biological control over the midges. Cardiff bay will be known as insecticide bay because we will have the same problem as is experienced with many American amenity lakes—the constant smell of insecticides around the edges. Insecticides are the only alternative way of controlling the midges. Angling interests are vital to the Bill. We are fed up to the back teeth with discrimination in favour of the angling interests on the River Usk as against the angling interests on the Rivers Taff and Ely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilyrn Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not comment on the class war over the Usk barrage Bill mentioned by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West. That is a private matter, on which the Government have taken no position. We all take pleasure at the progress that has been made on the matter of migratory salmon and trout. I agree with the hon. Member for Cardiff, West that sewin is a far better word for sea trout. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney was most tempting in his conjuring of delights for any jaded palates in the Committee. We could be forgiven for turning our attention to thoughts of lunch, which might encourage us to make even more progress in our consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney seeks statutory consultation for angling interests. The corporation has consulted angling interests, as a result of which a petition against the private Bill was withdrawn. We are happy to hear any further concerns of Merthyr anglers, but we do not want to re-open the question of the fish pass design—a technical matter which it has taken a long time to consider. There is fully adequate control over the design offish passes. The matter has been the subject of extensive consultation with the National Rivers Authority, which is the statutory body for the protection of fisheries. Clause 7(1)(c) requires the corporation to
	<br><q><p>"operate the barrage in accordance with any reasonable direction given by the National Rivers Authority in order … to protect fish in the inland bay or allow the passage of migratory fish to or from the inland bay."</p></q>
The design also requires the approval of the Secretary of State, as specified in paragraph 11(2)(d) of schedule 2. I hope that we have had a full debate and put the important considerations of angling interests on the record. I am not aware of any remaining problems that would justify reopening the question of the fish pass. I bow to the hon. Gentleman's pre-eminence as president of the Merthyr angling association, which is clearly a most knowledgeable

The barrage-related strategy cost was to be £547 million, of which £335 million was the public sector contribution, but the current cost, given the GDP deflator at market prices, is now £662 million, of which it is hoped—I emphasise that—that only £405 million will come from public sector. The costs of the scheme are escalating monthly in a horrifying way. We are now talking about more than £660 million on barrage-related expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At column 53 of the report of our last sitting the Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"the ratio"—</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>90</span>
of public expenditure to total barrage-related expenditure—
	<br><q><p>"is based not on firm guarantees from the private sector but on the very best assumptions that can be made"—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 25 June 1992; c. 53.]</p></q>
So, we are talking not about a contractually agreed amount, percentage or ratio between public and private expenditure but about a hope or an assumption. We believe that many assumptions are inaccurate and we know that they are far less valid than they were in 1989 and 1990. Those escalating costs are not acceptable to a House of Commons that was born and developed on the principle of scrutiny of expenditure. Amendment No. 110 takes on a new force in the light of the figures that we have been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity in this debate, or in the clause stand part debate, to give the Committee a considered response to the report by Jacqueline Mallender of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. I do not want the Minister simply to say that the previous economic appraisals were robust or sensitive. What is his response to the author's argument that, as the result of the fall in property values and other changes in assumptions, much of the benefit of the scheme is in doubt?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that many members of the Committee are avid readers of 	<i>The Economist.</i> On the barrage scheme, the current edition of that journal says that costs are clearer but benefits are much less clear. It publishes a critical article on the relationship between costs and benefits. Criticism comes not only from interested parties, such as myself—I have an interest in the comparative levels of public expenditure and want to ensure that money is utilised properly in the Welsh economy—but from a broader section outside our own patch. That is only right, because the expenditure has wider implications and should be debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we examine operating costs we shall find that there has been an escalation there, too. The cost of the barrage started at £85 million and is now estimated to be £165 million; the barrage-related costs were to be £400 million but have now risen to £662 million, of which an indeterminate amount of £405 million is expected from the public sector. The gross cost of the envisaged scheme could be £750 million and the cost of the barrage nearly £200 million. We have a right to ask, as we ask in the amendment that
	<br><q><p>"the Secretary of State shall report to Parliament each year the total of disbursements attributable to this Act and the recoveries arising from the powers authorised in subsection (2) above".</p></q>
The amendment has added force in the light of the escalating costs of the scheme, exposed during this and previous debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall add to the comments on the amendment made by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. The amendment is innocuous; it merely asks the Government to ensure that the Secretary of State reports to the House of Commons the amount of money spent by the Cardiff Bay development corporation on the bay project. My hon. Friend rightly pointed out that accountability on financial matters relating to Cardiff Bay appears vague. Had the result of the general election been different, local authorities, which are accountable, would have dealt with the money and thus the situation would have been completely different.

Those responsible for the expenditure in question are not elected public authorities. It is vital that hon. Members who represent Welsh constituencies should be told precisely how the money is to be spent and, if the amounts involved seem excessive—£600 million seems to have run up rapidly in the past few months—it is up to Members of Parliament, in our traditional role, to consider the way in which the Government spend them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing wrong with the amendment; it is vital for Wales and for proper public accounting. Local authorities in Wales have to account for every single penny that they spend. By comparison, the amendment makes a fairly modest request, to which I hope the Government will respond positively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In response to the general point raised by the hon. Members for Torfaen and Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, naturally I appreciate the legitimate interest of members of the Committee and other Members of Parliament in public expenditure and its scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to my comments at a previous sitting in response to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, who spoke about rising costs. I hope that the latest figures, which I gave him, were of help and that other members of the Committee have seen them. I repeat that the Cardiff Bay barrage can in no way be described as a project that is out of control. I gave examples of the difference between the relevant price inflator and our latest projection of the cost—there is no more than a 3 per cent. difference. Price inflation alone would have accounted for almost all of that increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yes, we must proceed on the best assumptions, using the best appraisal and the best survey. How often do we find that we are not dealing with copper-bottomed guarantees? We have to make the best assumptions and use our best judgments. The dreams that we wish to come to fruition are seldom based on copper-bottomed guarantees. But if we do not have the courage to make progress, little or nothing will be achieved. The Committee has the opportunity to debate the concept of the best assumptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is equally right to ask whether, if the dreams do not come true or if the private sector does not deliver its proportion of the gross barrage costs, the Welsh Office will make up the difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about something that will continue, and we shall have the opportunity to consider further the costs involved and to test our views of the very best assumptions; nothing remains fixed in stone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Committee's function was to scrutinise these matters, so will he now answer the question? If that assumption turns out to be inaccurate and the private sector does not come forward with its proportion of the costs, will the Welsh Office make up the difference—yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a case of trying to answer yes or no. As a predecessor of mine in the post of Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney will understand that Governments continue to review projects. We make assumptions and expect them to continue, but no one should be hidebound and have to stick to assumptions that later prove invalid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>92</span>
Hon. Members have asked me to respond particularly to the economic reappraisal submitted by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State received the critique of the economic appraisal of the barrage, commissioned by the RSPB, only at the end of last week. It is currently under detailed consideration and we shall reply to the RSPB in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our initial view suggests that the appraisal is fundamentally flawed in its treatment of some of the major issues. It has failed to include the betterment effect on the value of pre-existing properties. In taking out the benefits of developing the north of the Ferry road tip site, it has failed to take out the associated costs. It does nothing to alter our conclusion that the January 1990 update of the economic appraisal is highly robust in suggesting that the barrage represents the most favourable way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary. Audited accounts, setting out all the corporation's financial transactions, are reported annually to the Secretary of State, in accordance with guidelines laid down by the Secretary of State as provided for in paragraph 10(3) of schedule 31 to the Local Government Planning and Land Act 1980. Those accounts are, in turn, presented annually by the Secretary of State to Parliament. Among other matters, they set out the level of grant in aid to the corporation, and expenditure on special projects such as the barrage and related matters are identified separately. The accounts also identify in detail other sources of income to the corporation. I suggest to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney that there is more than adequate opportunity for the legitimate aspirations of all members of the Committee, and Members of Parliament generally, to continue to scrutinise the barrage project, and any other project.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I had to miss part of the Minister's reply, but I have a sore throat this morning and needed a cup of coffee and a couple of aspirins. I hope that the Minister accepts that no discourtesy was intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that detailed and frequent reports must be made to Parliament on how to handle the disbursements and the recoveries of money because the sums involved are so large. The Secretary of State should therefore have a specific obligation rather than simply the usual obligation to cover grants in aid and recoveries of money. The difference between the gross costs and the net costs runs into hundreds of millions of pounds. A shortfall in the recoveries, through the sales of land or charges and fees, would make that difference colossal and could have a spin-off effect on other public expenditure programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking the sums on which we have been working so far, the difference between the gross and the net costs is £212 million. The public sector contribution to the gross cost is £335 million out of a total of £547 million gross; that assumes recoveries of £212 million. But the update that we received after the Minister's efforts to respond to the points that we made last week, shows that the difference between gross and net costs has risen to £257 million. Any shortfall that might occur because the strategy is not as robust as the Minister claims would cause a colossal spin-off on other public expenditure programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has admitted that his definition of "robust" is that the strategy is confidently based on a position that is unaffected by the ups and downs of today's property market and proof against a Canary Wharf style shock. Jacqueline Mallender is an ex-Treasury economist. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>93</span>
Minister knocks the RSPB Mallender report, which shows a minus net current value of £110 million in evaluating the barrage along Treasury lines. If he is right and, despite the current depression of the property market, high levels of recoveries are possible, the public sector contribution can be kept in line with its position before the Canary Wharf collapse when Peat Marwick McLintock and Roger Tym and partners carried out the financial appraisal in January 1990. He claims that if he is wrong, it does not matter, as the recoveries will merely be delayed. That is not good enough for Parliament. The project is sensitive after the property market crash, and it is absolutely essential that it is subject to proper parliamentary control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategy depends on the rate of the recoveries which, in turn, depends on how soon the property market recovers from the recession. If it recovers quickly, the figure of two thirds public sector cost and a one third recovery could be achieved. But if the property market takes 10 years to recover, as most people predict, there will be an enormous delay in the rate of the recoveries. It will be impossible for the corporation to sell plots of land for office development at high prices post-barrage. It is perfectly proper to add the provision outlined in the amendment to all the normal public expenditure controls, such as an annual report and presentation of accounts, and the National Audit Office's right to audit. The project depends on a recovery from the depression in the property market. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. If he does not he will be open to the criticism that the Government are afraid of the truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 62, in page 2, line 38, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(1A) Unless the National Rivers Authority otherwise agree, the barrage shall be so constructed that it is practicable between one high tide and the next to reduce the level of water immediately behind it to a level of one and a quarter metres below ordnance datum (Newlyn).".</p></q>
The amendment is the result of the continuing dialogue between officials of the Welsh Office and the National Rivers Authority. It repeats a provision of the private Bill, and was included originally in the draft regulations to be made under clause 20 for the protection of the NRA's interests. However, the NRA indicated in discussion a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>94</span>
preference for inclusion of the contents of the draft regulations in the text of the Bill. The Government acceded to the request, given the special role and status of the NRA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to NRA water quality responsibilities. It specifies the level to which it must be possible to lower water in the inland bay between tides. In practice, the level specified by the NRA enables the bay to be fully drained between tides. That requirement would only be needed in an emergency which we hope will never occur. However, it is necessary to enable a major pollution incident to be flushed out into the estuary. An example of such an incident might be a major discharge of pollutants taking place upstream of the barrage, or a road accident resulting in a tanker carrying fuel oil or some similar substance ending up in the inland lake. Such possibilities are very remote, but a sluice design would allow them to be dealt with as a contingency.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 116, in page 17, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(5) No reclamation of land for the purpose of creating islands in the inland bay under paragraph (g) of sub-paragraph (1) above shall take place without the express agreement of the Countryside Council for Wales and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have dealt briefly with this subject before in connection with the reclamation of land for the creation of islands. The Minister has referred to that without going into any detail. Amendment No. 114 would amend the opening line of schedule 2 on page 16 of the Bill, and the substantive provision is contained in amendment No. 116.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether the Government will agree to the amendment. It is user-friendly, and there is no intention of trapping the Government into doing something that they do not want to do. The amendment tackles the way in which legislation refers to and covers the authorisation of works that are to be carried out. The creation of the islands, proposed in the Bill but not laid down in any hard and fast way, would require parliamentary authorisation. Line 45 of schedule 2(1) refers to the reclamation of islands, but there is no mention of the way in which agreement might be reached over the islands' design, nor is it stated that any such agreement with interested parties must be reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier this morning, we discussed who should be consulted before an undertaking begins. It seems appropriate that, in this case, those consulted should include the Countryside Council for Wales and the RSPB, as the sole purpose of the island or islands in the bay is to show that the barrage, although it will involve the flooding of a site of special scientific interest for wading birds, is not entirely unfriendly to birds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>95</span>
Some form of feeding ground in the middle of the estuary could be used by birds other than the redshank, dunlin and other traditional winter occupants of the mudflats, which will be displaced to the Gwent levels or wherever the Minister finds them an alternative Welsh, Slimbridge-type home. The other birds would use a well-protected island which cannot be fussed over by too many members of the human race getting too close. It is therefore appropriate that the Countryside Council for Wales and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds should be consulted on the issue. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the amendments in the friendly spirit in which the hon. Member for Cardiff, West intends them. I reassure him that Bill as drafted takes account of the aspect highlighted by the proposals. The conservation issues raised are covered in clause 2(3), which requires the development corporation to have regard to the desirability of developing and conserving flora and fauna. Clause 2(4) requires the development corporation to consult the Countryside Council for Wales and the RSPB and to seek their views on measures which may be taken in executing the works so as to develop and conserve flora and fauna. Those clauses set out clearly the importance attached to the development and conservation of flora and fauna in the Bill. Clause 2(5) brings the provision in paragraph 1(1)(g) of schedule 2—which deals with the formation of islands—within the requirement to consult the Countryside Council for Wales and the RSPB.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments go further, and would give the Countryside Council for Wales and the RSPB powers of control over the creation of islands. The corporation does not at present plan to create islands for anything other than nature conservation purposes. I suggested earlier what we have in mind for the alternative mitigation managers. Nevertheless, the Countryside Council for Wales is not equipped to exercise control over development and it does not do so elsewhere. It would be wrong to give such power of control to the RSPB, which is not a statutory body. I hope that the hon. Member for Cardiff, West will feel that the amendments, however friendly, are already dealt with in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree, however, that it is not uncommon to give specialist bodies—angling interests and so on—right of consultation in the design of facilities which are intended to buy off opposition, in this case, to the barrage, from those who have an interest in a particular nature conservation area? I do not mean that cynically, but if the promoters of the barrage, the Welsh Office and the quango that it has created to pursue the matter, feel that they are seen as anti-nature conservation, anti-birdlife and anti-birdwatchers interests, they should have an obligation to try to overcome that bad image. They should reach out to the interests and give them some right of consultation. If the Minister feels that the phrase "express agreement" in the amendment is too strong, but if the right of consultation would meet with his approval, he or I can return later with another amendment which keeps to the spirit of the proposal of which the Minister hinted he approved. If he does not accept that, it will be odd. Cardiff Bay development corporation will say, "We don't know much about islands but we are going to build them. We will not ask anybody who may know more than we do to design them."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>96</span>
I intend to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, but I hope that the Minister will have noted the point that has been made so that we can return to it in a different form if he agrees that it is a way in which consensus can be reached between the Cardiff Bay development corporation and the bird watching and conservation interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"within 25 metres of the foreshore".</p></q>
The amendment is important. It would ask the Welsh Office to define what is meant by the power granted in subparagraph 1(1)(f) of schedule 2 which states:
	<br><q><p>"raise, sink or otherwise alter the levels of any land".</p></q>
We need to know how wide that power is intended to go, which is why we have made the experimental proposal that such activity be limited to within 25 metres of the bay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to probe the Government's intention. Do they mean land that is in the inland bay, or land that touches it? Do they mean land that is part of the inland bay's bank? I hope that the Minister will explain the function of subparagraph 1(1)(f) and say whether he will accept the restriction proposed in the amendment. If the land in question is riparian land, schedule 2 should say so: if it is to be land that extends a little way inshore, the amendment will make that clear. However, if he has something else in mind, I hope that he will describe it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I must answer the hon. Member for Cardiff, West in the negative. I am advised that the amendment as drafted would effectively prohibit both the reclamation of land within the inland bay and the dredging of silt within 25 metres of the foreshore. That is clearly impractical, as it means that the present edge of the bay could never be altered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are plans for reclamation of land to create waterfront developments, for which the Bill allows. Dredging will be required adjacent to some of the vertical edges within the bay, especially within the inner harbour area adjacent to the pier head building, where the mooring of vessels adjacent to the bayside walkway will be desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is so obviously detrimental to the development of the facilities in and around the inner bay that I urge the hon. Gentleman not to pursue it, as otherwise I should have no alternative but to ask the Committee to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments transfers, at the request of the National Rivers Authority, the bulk of the provisions of the former draft regulations into the body of the Bill. It removes from the existing schedule 2 the provision for a deemed impoundment licence under the Water Resources Act 1991 and certain related provisions and inserts them instead as new clauses. A new schedule incorporates both the existing and additional conditions of the deemed impoundment licence. In this way the group of amendments facilitates the performance by the NRA, in a way which has been agreed with it, of its functions in relation to water quality, fisheries and flooding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the second group of Government amendments in response to the NRA. We must take the opportunity offered by this group—which includes major new clauses and a new schedule—to press the Minister on how far he will reach out to the NRA on what should and should not be in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>100</span>
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our opening debate on the sittings motion, I drew attention to the novel, if not unique, character of the Committee. This is the first time that a Bill that started out as a private Bill has become a public Bill. Many procedural and legislative issues arise from such a unique transformation. Following the sittings motion, the Department circulated to us a briefing on the NRA's position of December 1991, in which special attention was drawn to the problems confronting an organisation such as the NRA in drafting the Bill. Page 53 of the briefing states:
	<br><q><p>"This new Bill differed from previous Bills in being a hybrid Government Bill. This restricts the scope of the NRA to petition".</p></q>
Therefore, there was a restriction on the NRA's scope to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More interestingly, the paragraph entitled, "The Present Position"—December 1991—on page 54 of the briefing states:
	<br><q><p>"The Government have advised the Authority that conditions of the deemed impoundment licence which the NRA had wished to see included within the Bill will be dealt with by means of Regulations promoted by the Secretary of State under Section 22 of the Bill."</p></q>
I welcome the fact that the Government have changed their views on the legislative character of the Bill and have included, through the new clauses and amendments, measures that would otherwise have been tucked away in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have not sought to amend the new schedule or new clauses, we can consider on Report how far they meet the NRA's anxieties. From what the Minister said, I assume that the drafting is an agreed form of words and that the NRA is satisfied. When he winds up the debate, I hope that the Minister will confirm that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I raise the matter now because I wonder how many more new proposals there will be before we finish discussing the Bill. If there are to be more, we should know about them now, so that we can debate the major revised Bill on Report. As one who has endeavoured to follow the legislative process from the private Bill, right through to the present Bill, I wonder whether other significant amendments will be introduced to deal with the NRA's point.
The next sentence of the NRA briefing continues:
	<br><q><p>"All other issues not dealt with in the Bill will be included in legally binding side agreements. The NRA has not yet had the opportunity to agree with the promoters the detail of these side agreements to the Bill. However the Authority has received from the Welsh Office and CBDC detailed undertakings on the content of these side agreements and the regulations and, taken together with the Bill itself, these indicate that all outstanding legal and technical issues have been resolved and the NRA's statutory duties are adequately safeguarded."</p></q>
I am sorry to say that while the NRA, the Cardiff Bay development corporation and the Minister may be happy, Members of this House are not. We want to know, what is the nature of the side agreements? Are there any left? In the amendments, the Government rightly seek to transfer regulations to new clauses and schedules in the Bill. Before our next sitting will the Minister explain the nature of any additional side agreements and tell the Committee whether they, too, can be included in the Bill, as it is only by their inclusion that they can be scrutinised, debated and amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the proposed schedule and new clauses. They are a method of dealing more openly with issues of profound concern, which affect the authority and statutory rights of major scrutinising bodies such as the NRA. When
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>101</span>
I read about further side agreements, however, my interest, if not suspicion, is aroused. I hope that those agreements can be included in the Bill, where they rightly belong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me add briefly to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. My hon. Friend has said a dozen times that the Bill has been transformed from a private Bill into a hybrid Bill, It now begins to resemble a private Bill again. The addition of the three-page long new schedule outlined in amendment No. 70 restores the Bill to its former shape—the shape it had when it was a private measure. We were not happy when the House was asked on 25th November 1991, to approve a Bill that resembled a Russian doll—a Gorbachev, which contained a Brezhnev, which contained a Kropotkin. Everything was thus hidden from public view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the inclusion in the Bill of the agreements with the NRA. They were hidden on Second Reading of the Government hybrid Bill, as distinct from the original 1988 Lords private Bill. Their inclusion is a welcome development in open Government—the Government should not have attempted to dissemble and hide from Parliament last November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have doubts about the arbitration procedure for disputes between the Cardiff Bay development corporation and the NRA. Government amendment No. 70 refers several times to arbitration by the Secretary of State for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the agreements with the NRA in relation to sewer outfalls and fish passses mean that the Welsh Office has a low flow water budget? Is that why the NRA has been able to agree the present wording? Has such a budget been agreed with the promoters of the Bill and those who control abstraction licneces from the lower reaches of the Taff and Ely rivers? Such a provision could reduce water flow into the inland bay to the point where a fish pass would not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4(1)(a) of Government amendment No. 70 provides for the development corporation to maintain a fish pass in the inland bay,
	<br><q><p>"except where circumstances beyond the control prevent it, the flow of water is not less than the relevant minimum flow."</p></q>
the minimum flow to operate the fish pass is about 1 cu m per second. During periods of low flow in the River Taff, that is about a quarter of the total flow. The total flow of the River Taff at present is controlled by Associated British Ports, through its historic rights of abstraction, which it no longer uses, at Blackweir, on the other side of the river in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central. ABP was supposed to produce a deal, otherwise the National Rivers Authority would not agree and had reserved the right of a second House undertaking with the Minister. We assume, as the NRA has agreed that wording, that ABP has agreed to give up its historic rights of abstraction at Blackweir. That could remove the whole of the low river flow and thus mean that the fish pass could not be operated, which would be in breach of the undertakings on salmonid fisheries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the sudden appearance of Government amendment No. 70 mean that the Minister has an agreement on water budgets between ABP and the Cardiff Bay development corporation that is satisfactory to the NRA?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the welcome given to the new clauses and amendments by the hon. Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Cardiff, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked me how far I would reach out to the National Rivers Authority. I hope to reach out as far as I can to the NRA and to all other interests—in Committee and outside it. Inevitably, it will not be possible to reach agreement on every issue, but I have been able effectively, to agree with one of the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney was right to quote the NRA's reference to its scope to petition against the Bill, which puts it into a particular category. As such, the hon. Member for Cardiff, West asked about arbitration procedures, the agreement regarding sewer outfalls, fish passes and low flow. Specifically on low flow, I am told that we have not yet reached agreement with the National Rivers Authority, but I am assured that discussions are progressing well. We are confident that we will reach agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are already aware, from discussions in the press of which yachting interests in Cardiff have had to take account, that there may be nice days in July and August—the kind of weather we are having now—when yachtsmen will be unable to get out of Cardiff Bay into the open sea. At times of low flow, preference will have to be given to the operating offish passes rather than boat locks. Boating interests in Cardiff have had to accept the hard fact that there is not enough water coming down the River Taff at times of low flow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is more difficult to solve when it involves saline flushing and ABP's historic abstraction rights, which are important to the operation of the docks and steelworks in Cardiff. It is less tricky to say to boating interests, "Well, this is tough luck, but you must live with it," than to say the same to ABP, which needs the water to top up the docks, to use as cooling water in the steelworks and rolling mills of Cardiff and for flushing out salt water which may have an adverse effect on the water in the Bay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, West is right and the points that he made are important. For the moment I can tell him only that we are holding discussions with the NRA which I am confident are progressing well. I am sure that we shall reach the right conclusion. I cannot, however, anticipate that conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked a specific question: how many more potential side agreements are there between the NRA and the development corporation via the Welsh Office? Of those, how many more can be brought into the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Generally, the NRA is satisfied with what is happening. The consequent amendments have been tabled and are before the Committee for consideration. The hon. Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Cardiff, West asked about side agreements. I accept the spirit of their question and, subject to agreement with the NRA, I shall be happy to table amendments relating to side agreements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 	<i>The Economist</i> last weekend, Ms. Frances Cairncross wrote an article about Cardiff bay in a survey of Britain. The final paragraph says:
	<br><q><p>"If Cardiff still wants a barrage for its scenic impact, it should be paid for by the council,"—</p></q>
we might not agree with that—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>
	<br><q><p>"rather than dolled up as an economic asset to be financed by the taxpayer. Some of the cost might even be met by Associated British Ports, the owner of several good sites on the bay. But if common sense, and the birds, are to prevail, a cold eye from the Treasury is probably the best bet."</p></q>
There are a number of arguments in that article but the important one is about Associated British Ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
ABP was covered by the compulsory purchase order until shortly after the general election of 1987. Within months of that election, the previous Secretary of State for Wales, who had voluntarily retired after setting up the Cardiff Bay development corporation and getting the show on the road by getting a fixed commitment to it, joined ABP's board and also became the chairman of the National Rivers Authority. Shortly after that, ABP was exempted from the compulsory purchase order. Many of those who were not exempted from the compulsory purchase order felt that those events were not entirely unconnected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although ABP and the Cardiff Bay development corporation claim that a mathematical formula has been arranged so that the ABP will be required, on the development and betterment of its land fringing the inland bay, to make a contribution to the Cardiff Bay development corporation, no one in the House has seen that formula. We shall be happy to seek to withdraw the amendment if the Minister can tell us that the mathematical formula will be provided during the scrutiny of the Bill. Otherwise the suspicion is bound to arise that the then Secretary of State for Wales, Nicholas Edwards who is now
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>104</span>
Lord Crickhowell, set up the Cardiff Bay development corporation and was instrumental in obtaining the exemption of ABP from the compulsory purchase order, in return for which ABP ceased to be petitioners against the Bill. It does not look good. The amendment would clarify the position and make it clear, as is standard with other Bills, that there should be no discrimination between different classes of landowner or occupier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was impressed by the impeccable argument of the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. I hope that he will be impressed by my equally impeccable reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can reassure both him and his hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West on the points that they raised. The provisions contained in subsections (1) to (3) of clause 3 are normal for a works Bill that contains compulsory purchase powers. The effect of the provisions is to apply legislation relevant to compulsory purchase procedures in the same way as the legislation would have applied if the land acquisition had been authorised by a compulsory purchase order rather than by express provisions in the Bill. Clearly, arbitrary discrimination between different classes of landowner in relation to the implementation of a compulsory purchase order would not be lawful. That applies equally when the legislation is applied to the compulsory purchase of specific land as authorised by statute. Accordingly, it follows that the proposed amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to Associated British Ports, which is contributing to the cost of development. I cannot respond to specific questions about that because, as he would be the first to know, such agreements are subject to commercial confidence. However, I support the sedentary comment of the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) about the reference to the council paying for the barrage. Neither he, I nor any other member of the Committee wish to see that happen. I was fascinated by the reference of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West to the cold eye of the Treasury.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is our first opportunity to discuss the impact of the barrage on the water table adjoining the barrage area. The amendment attempts to make the Government more aware of the factors to be taken into account when the barrage is being operated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill imposes a duty on the Cardiff Bay development corporation to operate the barrage in such a way that it does no harm to adjoining properties. We want ot ensure that the corporation's powers go beyond those to
	<br><q><p>"alleviate flooding or to meet any other emergency".</p></q>
That is rather loose: it merely covers the opening of sluice gates to prevent water cascading into overground flooding. A major consideration in regard to any impounded barrage is that its operation should not affect the viability of properties—be they buildings, parks or sports grounds—as a result of the rise in groundwater. Many properties are built on flat land and adjoining the proposed barrage. Most are on the west side, built there is also a great deal of commercial property in the central Cardiff area on the east side of the barrage, including important Welsh institutions such as the national rugby stadium.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many ways to protect recreational land and commercial and residential property, but clause 7(3) is biased towards trying to "prevent or alleviate flooding". The Select Committee that considered the Bill defined "flooding" as flooding overground—the bursting of the banks of a river or lake by water surcharging those banks. That does not cover the various forms of flooding that we must consider when scrutinising the Bill, such as saturation flooding, which does not fall within the statutory definition. Lawyers acting for the Cardiff Bay development corporation at the time of the Select Committee hearing tried unsuccesfully to find a precedent for its inclusion in the statutory definition. That point has been made forcefully by the legal and drainage departments of the Cardiff City Council and has caused the Secretary of State for Wales to scrutinise what the Stoner report says on special drainage measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has tried to wriggle out of the Government's earlier commitment to accept the Stoner report. My constituents feel strongly about any resiling from the Secretary of State's commitment before the general election to accept the Stoner report in full, but the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>106</span>
Minister said this morning that the additional £9 million recommended by Mr. Stoner no longer applies. That is contrary to the promises clearly given by the Secretary of State to accept the report's recommendation saturation flooding should be taken seriously. Saturation flooding should be written into the Bill as an operational consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 would cover the need to protect the interests of the owners and users of recreation land, such as the national stadium and many sports grounds and parks as far as Victoria Park and Leckwith Moors in my constituency, which are at exceptionally low points, as well as residential properties that will be affected by rising groundwater. The Stoner report published six months ago graphically describes the affect of rising groundwater on basements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that Government realise that they will not get very far with the Bill on a good will basis unless they concede considerable ground. They have already had to concede ground in arguing whether the statutory defnition of flooding covers satuaration flooding. Will the Minister concede further ground and accept that these are wise amendments that cover other priorities that must be considered in the operation and management of the barrage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments seek to impose on the operation of the barrage considerations that have already been taken into account in the design of the barrage. It is right and proper that the maintenance and enjoyment of residential amenities on land adjoining the inland bay and consideration of commercial and recreational land and property should form part of the overall consideration of the scheme. That consideration has taken place in the setting of the impoundment level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill requires the development corporation to maintain the level of water in the inland bay at between 4 metres and 4.5 metres except in certain defined circumstances. Following exhaustive work on groundwater modelling, which has been the subject of public consultation, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has announced his decision that all economic, technical and safety criteria can be met by a barrage impounding the inland bay at 4.5 metres. Schedule 6 to the Bill contains a comprehensive scheme of protection against any effects of rising groundwater on property and gardens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The design of the barrage and the limits within which the bay is to be impounded have effectively struck the balance that is suggested by the amendment. The impoundment above 4.5 metres is not desirable due to the effect on property and impoundment below 4 metres would not cover the mud flats and therefore the development aspirations would not be achieved. The amendments are unnecessary since, as I have said, the provisions proposed have been considered in the design of the barrage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reassure the hon. Member for Cardiff, West that there has been no change of position regarding the Stoner report. I referred earlier to the difference between the worst case, as outlined in the Stoner report, and the most likely case. Obviously, we are proceeding on the basis of the most likely case. That is the best and only way to proceed. I trust that the hon. Gentleman will not misrepresent me—there has been no change of position on the Stoner report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far from misrepresenting the Minister, I am merely reading from the Stoner report, which I believe the Secretary of State accepts. Paragraph 7iii on page 10 of the Stoner report states:
	<br><q><p>"Cardiff Bay Development Corporation are at pains to point out that they consider Run 77 to be very much the extreme case and would expect much lower levels of groundwater in practice."</p></q>
The Minister relies on that, yet ignores the following sentence:
	<br><q><p>"Nevertheless, the funds to meet the extreme case have been identified and I consider that the provision will meet the need that may arise.</p></q>
The Minister is saying that he no longer wants to include in the Bill the funds identified in the Stoner report—the additional £9 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a change of policy. The Secretary of State said that funds would be provided, as recommended in the Stoner report, which says:
	<br><q><p>"funds to meet the extrem case have been identified".</p></q>
If the Secretary of State accepted the Stoner report, which he did in full, the Minister cannot now say to the Committee, "Well, what's £9 million between friends—what's the point of including the additional 4,000 properties, previously not regarded as likely to incur possible damage and to require damp-proof courses or basement tanking?" The Minister must rethink his attitude, which will go down badly in Riverside, Canton, Pontcanna, Leckwith and Victoria Park in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is not dealing adequately with the point raised by Cardiff city council in the final stages of the proceedings of the Select Committee. On Second Reading and at the time of the private Bill, the Government rejected strongly the theories advanced by Dr. John Miles and Professor Ken Rushton that there was serious danger of the barrage creating urban swamp conditions in densely populated areas of terraced residential housing in my constituency. Far from criticising that theory, the Government, not having bothered to cross-examine Dr. John Miles and Professor Ken Rushton in the Select Committee just before the election, accept that the urban swamp hypothesis is probably correct and have concentrated their efforts, via the Stoner report, on how to drain the urban swamp that would be created by rising groundwater levels. They do not contest the thesis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dr. Miles and Professor Rushton were cross-examined for four days when the private Bill was introduced and this idea was first suggested, but their cross-examination in February and March this year was perfunctory. They were cross-examined for no more than 40 minutes each by Mr. Jeremy Sullivan, the Cardiff Bay development corporation silk, who, if he had thought there was a weakness in their argument about the urban swamp, would have attempted to find it. He did not bother; he merely said that a way would be found to drain the swamps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government then said to Cardiff city council "You already have statutory powers." They had to go back on that and say, "Maybe you don't have statutory powers, so we will give you such powers." I think that such powers were introduced in the other place, although that will have the effect of rehybridising the Bill, it will come back to this House again—according to the authorities in the other place—some time in 1993. The Minister should realise that the Bill will run into heavy weather unless he deals with the question of groundwater in a less cavalier manner. It will affect residential properties in the central area of Cardiff,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>108</span>
the national rugby stadium and parks and sports grounds in a very wide area on both banks of the Taff through to the river Ely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no cavalier attitude. The hon. Member for Cardiff, West is, at best, confusing himself. We are designing the barrage to be safe, even if run 77 happened. We are funding for what is necessary. On that basis, the costs forecasted are the most likely costs. The Miles and Rushton urban swamp theory was shown to be wrong. That was the Stoner report's conclusion and that is the Government's view. The crucial point is that schedule 6 contains a comprehensive scheme to protect any effects of rising groundwater on properties and gardens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to cover some of the ground covered by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West on a previous amendment. These amendments refer to flooding. We shall be dealing with the problem of groundwater flooding, and we can open the debate on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday evening the Minister and I were at a function in Cardiff. I had the opportunity to talk to a distinguished previous Lord Mayor of that city who is in favour of the Cardiff Bay barrage, but was concerned—as many thousands of people are—about groundwater flooding. The purpose of the amendments is to refer specifically to saturation flooding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 102 refers to the "saturation of the ground". It is a probing amendment to ask the Government whether that is a proper definition of another form of flooding and, if so, whether the cost of alleviating
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>109</span>
such land saturation flooding should fall on Cardiff City Council, or should be covered by the Cardiff Bay development corporation, whose expenditure, as we heard this morning, is increasing greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the decades, flooded basements have been a real problem in Cardiff and the fear of saturation is equally important. I hope that in his reply the Minister will reassure me that saturation is regarded as flooding and that any such cost arising from saturation flooding would fall not on the local authority as the land drainage authority but on the Cardiff Bay development corporation, as the Stoner report hints.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill requires the level of impoundment to be between 4m and 4.5m which, combined with the protection scheme in schedule 6, effectively provides the safeguards against groundwater damage which the amendments seek to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said, following exhaustive work on groundwater modelling and public consultation, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has announced his decision that all economic, technical and safety criteria relating to groundwater could be met by impoundment at the proposed level. Impoundment below 4m would not cover the mudflats and therefore would not achieve the four development objectives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that last time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and it is relevant again, which is why I feel that it should be put on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Neither of the bodies involved had requested the powers of direction which would be conferred by amendments Nos. 105 and 106. Indeed, in its December 1991 statement,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>110</span>
which is on the Table, the National Rivers Authority said that it has no specific powers to deal with groundwater flooding. The amendments also raise the question of which body would have precedence in making directions regarding groundwater flooding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government intend to make regulations under clause 20 which will cover the city councils environmental health responsibilities. Members of the council have formally voted that they are content with the terms of the draft regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments cover important matters, but their purpose has already been achieved by other means. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that these important points are a response to his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that this will, in effect, rehybridise the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, sir. I urge the Committee not to pursue the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
