	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. A small difficulty has arisen concerning our proceedings next week. We hope to discuss potatoes for two sittings and I believe that a sittings motion will be moved later this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past few days, important discussions have taken place in the European Community that will influence our debate next week. Will the Government provide the Committee with information on the state of those negotiations? We understand that there has been no movement in the Council of Ministers on the potato regime, but it would be helpful to have a briefing from the Government on the state of play because that will influence our debate next Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for the Chair. The Minister cannot make a statement, but there can, of course, be private talks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>VARIATION OF APPROVED SCHEME</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 15, in page 5, line 22, leave out from "taken" to end of line 24 and insert
	<br><q><p>"all practicable steps to bring full details of the proposed variation to the attention of registered producers, to other producers who may have an interest in joining any successor body, to all other buyers of milk from the board and to all other persons who may have a legitimate interest in the consequences of the proposed reorganisation scheme. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing obligation, such steps shall not be deemed to have been taken unless the board has put into place arrangements to allow the relevant details to be made available to any person demanding them within a period of 10 days from the date on which the demands is received by the board, or".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to debate the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 35, in page 5, line 23, after "principle", insert "and details".</p>
	<p>No. 34. in page 5, line 24, leave out
	<br><q><p>"persons who are registered producers".</p></q>
and insert
	<br><q><p>"producers, consumers, retailers and purchasers of milk".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is, yet again, an amendment on consultation. Clause 5(2) states:
	<br><q><p>"The appropriate authority shall not approve a variation of an approved scheme unless—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) it is satisfied—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(i) that the relevant board has taken reasonable steps to bring the principle of the proposed variation to the attention of persons who are registered producers".</p></q>
We want to extend that to include
	<br><q><p>"all other buyers of milk from the board and … all other persons who may have a legitimate interest in the consequences of the proposed reorganisation".</p></q>
The amendment would impose a responsibility on the board to make such details available within 10 days of being asked to provide them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Dairy Trade Federation states that the Board's obligation to disclosure any proposed variation to the scheme should be extended in the same way that the Federation itself has also just suggested that the disclosure of the proposed scheme be extended under clause 3(2)(a). The Dairy Trade Federation for England and Wales states that the 10-day rule seems a reasonable provision for reducing unnecessary paper work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 35 refers to details. Again, interested parties are concerned that information on the principle of proposed changes is insufficient and that information about detail is required. I hope that Ministers will not again hide behind arguments on sensitivity and commercial confidentiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 34 is another consultative amendment. As I have said on many occasions, one is struck repeatedly by the restricted nature of consultation under the Bill. Once again, we are trying to widen the range of people and organisations to be consulted about Ministers' proposals and views on approving schemes of reorganisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 5 deals
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0088">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>147</span>
with the possibility of varying the scheme. We need to make provision that it might be necessary to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can assure the hon. Member for Workington. (Mr. Campbell-Savours). The scheme will put the onus on the milk marketing board to consult with producers and to bring the matter to their attention. It puts the onus on the Ministry to ensure that before we reach a judgment all relevant parties have been consulted. In the normal business of the Ministry, we are meeting constantly with people across the industry. Were a big variation proposed, the Ministry would not contemplate approving it until we had carried out extensive consultations with all those who would be affected by it, be they in the Dairy Trade Federaton or consumer organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not it strange that, before our proceedings today, I stood outside this Room, discussing consultation with people who represent outside organisations. They told me of a failure to consult with the Food and Drink Federation, one of the largest organisations in the industry, on aspects of the Bill. I think that the Minister said, "We are consulting all the time." Why, then, do those people keep telling me that they are not being consulted? There is a divergence of views about what constitutes consultation. Will the Minister address himself to the realities of what people are telling us and not to what Ministry officials are telling him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a question not of what my officials are telling me but of the consultations in which the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I have engaged. The Food and Drink Federation was consulted on the "New World" proposals. We have had the Diary Trade Federation in through the Ministry doors on umpteen occasions. We have also met on several occasions the many organisations that are concerned about these developments. Even individual producers have come into the Ministry. Consulation is the meat and drink of the daily life of the Ministry. I assure the hon. Member for Workington that, if there is a substantial change, we shall consult all parties, including the Food and Drink Federation. There may be a small, niggly change—for example, to the schedule to property. In such circumstances, the degree of consultation would be much less. However, I hope that I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall pay attention in our consideration of any variation to all people who have a legitimate interest in having the full details before a judgment is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 5 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>WITHDRAWAL OF APPROVAL</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 53, in page 5, line 33, leave out
	<br><q><p>"on the application of the relevant board".</p></q>
This is a probing amendment. Clause 6(1) currently states:
	<br><q><p>"The appropriate authority may, on the application of the relevant board before the vesting day under an approved scheme, withdraw the scheme's approval if it is satisfied that there has been a material change of circumstances since the scheme was approved."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>148</span>
I have racked my brains but I cannot, for the life of me, envisage any circumstance in which that might happen. What is the material change of circumstance that Ministers have in mind? Is it that this is simply an open-ended provision, or do they foresee conditions in which it will be necessary to reconsider a scheme? One would have thought that, if the board had come so far and cleared all the hurdles, there would be no question of withdrawal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the hon. Member for Workington is probing with this amendment. I am sure that none of us expect such circumstances to arise, but we have to make provision in case they do. We are looking beyond the horizon to anticipate what the circumstances might be. I have thought of three examples in which there might be a material change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is that if the board were to lose a major court case—for example, in the European Court of Justice. The hon. Member for Workington will be aware of a series of cases at various levels of courts that are against the board. The low-fat milk case is likely to come before the European Court first. If the board were to lose that and, as a consequence, the existing milk marketing scheme fell in on itself prematurely because a large area of milk production embraced by the statutory provisions would have been ruled out, there may have to be a rethink.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second circumstance, which all of us agree is very unlikely, would be if sign up by producers to Milk Marque were low—perhaps only 10 per cent. None of us envisage that, but one never knows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third circumstance would be if, because of conditions on the stock market, Dairy Crest could not be floated due to a problem with the timetable of the flotation. We expect that the scheme submitted to us for approval will, at its heart, separate Dairy Crest from what the hon. Member for Workington calls a broking function of Milk Marque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those examples might represent a material change of circumstances. We do not expect them to arise, but the object of the clause is to enable action to be taken should they occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that explanation, but it dodges the other question on this subsection. What will be the trigger? Who will decide when there is a material change of circumstance that would bring the procedure into play? I understand that, if the subsection is unamended, that would happen only on "application of the relevant board". The Minister gave us some helpful examples. However, if the case were borderline, the trigger might not be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to be sure about the drafting of the subsection. I understand from what the Minister said that the only circumstances in which such a situation would arise would be when the authority decided that a matter had to be reviewed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that the board will have to submit to the Minister that there has been a material change of circumstance. The Minister will have to be satisfied that there is a material change of circumstance. The process of contact between the board and the Ministry is likely to be constant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0089">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>149</span>
The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) has, in the past, invited me to squeeze or nudge. I have no doubt that if the Ministry believed that circumstances required a rethink, that that would be debated by the two parties, the system in practice will make a great deal of difference. The answer is technical. We will have to be satisfied that there is a material change of circumstance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Minister has dealt with the point that was made by the hon. Member for North Cornwall. There could be a dispute, the board might not agree or Ministers might want to insist. The Minister has said that those matters would be discussed and that an agreement would be reached. Are there powers elsewhere in the Bill that would give the Minister the right to insist if he believed that approval should be withdrawn?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no—I am learning rapidly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not it be wiser to give the Minister time to consider his response after consultation and, if necessary, to deal with the matter on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly willing to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 53 would give the initiative to Ministers. That could lead to the opposite situation, where we think that there is a material change of circumstance and the board does not. It does not resolve the circumstances outlined so, perhaps, it would be wiser to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the amendment was a probing one, and we do not intend to press it to a vote. We are merely trying to establish what the conditions are and whether Ministers will have the necessary powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will undertake to clarify at a later stage any circumstances that we have not been able to clarify in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 6 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 7</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>INFORMATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 51, in page 6, line 29, leave out "reasonable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If ever we needed evidence that legislation is drafted by parliamentary counsel—barristers—the word "reasonable" is it. I say that as someone trained for the Bar of England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that the word "appropriate" is an even more useful word?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but the problem with the word "reasonable" and, possibly, also with the word "appropriate" is that they enable many lawyers to live
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>150</span>
the sort of life to which they have become accustomed because they give rise to litigation time and again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone who has studied law knows that most law faculties devote a couple of weeks of an undergraduate degree course to an examination of the word "reasonable". Students are asked to consider what it means. They are taught that many statutes and many common-law judgments in courts throughout the jurisdiction are subject to the test of reasonableness. They are taught that the reasonable man is the person on the Clapham omnibus who, if he thinks that something is reasonable, will say, "Of course, that is reasonable" and who may be described as an officious bystander. Lawyers spend hours talking about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But why use the word "reasonable" at all? The Committee would set a wonderful example in reducing applications to courts throughout the common law world if we agreed a complete moratorium on use of the word "reasonable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my hon. Friends thanked the Minister for providing the notes on clauses, which have been so useful. The note on clause 7 states:
	<br><q><p>"This clause empowers Ministers to require any person to supply to them information which they consider necessary or desirable to enable them to decide whether or not to approve a reorganisation scheme, a variation of one or an application for withdrawal."</p></q>
The notes on clause 7 go on to discuss the consequences of failure to comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The authority to which clause 7 refers is Ministers. It is amusing to note that when my hon. Friend the Member for Workington consulted the Dairy Trade Federation about the amendment, he was sent a reply that gave away another game:
	<br><q><p>"The DTF would prefer any failure to comply with the provision of information by the MMB under clause 7(3) to be on reasonable rather than on unreasonable grounds".</p></q>
I suggest that was also written by lawyer—a person who hangs on to the word "reasonable" as Charlie Brown's friend does to his blanket. That is a further example of the fact that if a lawyer is asked a silly question, he is likely to give a silly answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In what circumstances can it possibly be reasonable for a statutory board, established by Acts of Parliament to refuse to provide information to Ministers? How can the test of reasonableness ever enter the question? If Ministers, under legislation set up by Acts of Parliament, require information and there is a statutory obligation to provide it, where does reasonableness come in? The word "reasonable" is superfluous, adds nothing and leads to uncertainty. It would help clarification were it deleted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I further understand that the statutory framework that set up the milk marketing board—the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958—makes no reference to a board having reasonable grounds for not complying with an order. That arrangement has worked reasonably well in the 35 years since 1958 and has not caused any difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot think of any reason to include a word that adds nothing to the Bill, offers no further clarification, does not clarify the degree to which Ministers have a responsibility, or to which an applicant would have an obligation, but gives more money to lawyers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that I should declare an indirect interest, as I have two children reading jurisprudence at

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not the same two children whom you mentioned last week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I forget the combinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to say, "Let's get away from reasonable", but what can be put in its place? If it is not replaced, the clause would allow the applicant to give grounds for not supplying information. I do not what to suggest that the board would be frivolous in its dealings with us, but the amendment would allow it to say, "Sorry, it's half-day closing in Thames Ditton and is not convenient," or, "It's a bank holiday," or, "We don't feel like it." The board could give any old reason for not giving the information that we need. I am not suggesting that it would do so, but the amendment would allow that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The amendment is an attempt to help the Government. We have been told repeatedly during our proceedings in Committee that the Government are short of time, and that with vesting day ever-nearing and with problems with the Maastricht Bill, the Government are under pressure. The consultation period has been shortened—reduced unreasonably—because of the pressure of time that the Government are under, which the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland referred to when he was discussing amendment No. 15.

Subsection (1) of the clause states:
	<br><q><p>"The authority to which an application under section 2, 5 or 6 above is made may by notice require any person to supply to it such information as may be specified in the notice, being information the supply of which the authority considers necessary".</p></q>
The amendment would affect subsection (5), which states that 21 days are allowed to explain failure to comply with a notice. That should be amended to 14 days. Will the Minister say why he would want to resist the amendment? It is perfectly reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We thought that 21 days was more reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment allows us to discuss penalties. As I said when moving amendment No. 50, we have been told repeatedly that speed is of the essence. I have a document on penalties that is provided to police officers. It is General Order: GOE9 entitled "the Criminal Justice Act 1991: Sentencing Provisions and Children's Evidence". It states:
	<br><q><p>"The following principles apply:</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(a) The sentence should reflect primarily the seriousness of the offence."</p></q>
It adds:
	<br><q><p>"The standard scale giving maximum fines on an adult on conviction of a summary offence are now:… Level 3 £1,000".</p></q>
As I understand it, the maximum penalty available under clause 7(6) is a £1,000 fine. Level 5 provides for a fine of £5,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's amendment has been printed wrongly. Clause 7(6) refers to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale. I believe that the hon. Gentleman wishes to amend that to level 3. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify that point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the problem when one writes one's own amendments. Clause 7(6) states:
	<br><q><p>"If any person other than the applicant under section 2, 5 or 6 above fails without reasonable excuse to comply with a notice under subsection (1) above, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 3".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just to simplify the matter, the hon. Gentleman's amendment is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. My printed version of the Bill states the opposite to the version of my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) may have an earlier version of the Bill that was printed prior to the acceptance of Lords amendments. I am sure that the matter can be sorted out. We all make small errors every once in a while.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been advised by the Minister that my amendment is in order, but whether he will accept it is another matter. The penalty should be raised. Failure to comply with the Bill's provisions will be a serious matter. If Ministers believe that speed is of essence, the will want to ensure that the time required for response is shortened and, in the absence of response, the level of penalty is such that it acts as a deterrent for those who want to delay unreasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reorganisation of the industry is at stake. Last month, a young chap in Gwent was fined £1,200 for throwing a crisp packet out of a window. If, however, someone in the MMBs decides to obstruct the will of Parliament to carry forward these proposals or of Ministers to introduce a scheme for reorganisation, he will be fined less than the penalty for throwing a crisp packet through the window of a motor car. I ask the Minister to consider raising the penalty in line with our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apparently in the copy of the Bill that the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury has, "level

5" has been printed whereas "level 3" appears in the copies which others of us have. Does this mean that the Minister decided during a more embryonic stage of the Bill that level 5 would be more appropriate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not so. I do not know which copy each hon. Member has. There are two levels of penalty. On the £1,000—£5,000 point, there is a standard rate of fines throughout legislation. When determining the penalties that should apply in these instances, there had to be consultations within the Government. The penalties are consistent with those applicable across the legal scale. I do not have flexibility to alter them. To do so would upset the general equilibrium of the hierarchy of fines that applies to a range of issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sanction against the board is much greater because it is a dismissal of its application for approval of a scheme.

Before speaking to the amendment perhaps I should explain to those who may read or observe our proceedings why we are not forcing a Division on many issues in the Bill. Over time hon. Members have felt that it is best to leave one's options open so as to be able to press for the selection of amendments on Report, arguing that matters were not fully debated in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of timing of a debate. Members of a Committee sometimes feel that it is better to get on with business and not be delayed by a Division. There is no indication to people outside of the real view of a Committee because of constraints that are placed on its members. Often it is felt better not to divide. We shall, of course, divide on other amendments, as my hon. Friends know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 17 has effectively come from the processors, who are worried that subsection (1) as worded would allow the board to act in ways that distorted competition between the board's processing operations and independent dairies, or that affected adversely the interests of producers or purchasers of milk, who feel that the provision should be left open-ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) states:
	<br><q><p>"The relevant board may do whatever is necessary for, or conducive to, the carrying out of an approved scheme in the period up to and including the vesting day under the scheme."</p></q>

We wish to add

Surely that is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is much concern that over the next 12 months the milk marketing board may conduct its affairs in a way that is not helpful to processors and others who trade with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to a debate on amendment No. 85 at the beginning of our proceedings, when we dealt with these matters in the context of varying vesting days—the different vesting days of a reorganisation scheme introduced in England and Wales and Scotland. Since that debate—and in relation to the amendment, which is about the distortion of the market during the 12-month period from now until vesting day—the Scottish Dairy Trade Federation stated that
	<br><q><p>"the nature of this potential difficulty is not fully understood by the Government."</p></q>
There is set out an explanation by way of a simplified example of trade in milk for the pasteurised drinking milk market, which covers more than 50 per cent, of all United Kingdom milk. It shows the effect of distortions in the market and why it is so important to take fully into account the interests of processors prior to vesting day. The federation says:
	<br><q><p>"The present Schemes … require the Board to sell all milk for the drinking milk market at the same price irrespective of the nature or location of the buyers. In these circumstances it is not possible for a Board to gain market share by offering attractive terms to new buyers without at the same time giving equally attractive terms to all existing buyers. This effectively prevents Boards 'poaching' buyers from other Boards' areas by offering specially attractive terms. The Scottish Board in particular is known to have aspirations to develop its market in the North and Midlands of England (it has already managed to establish a trading link with Lancashire Dairies in Manchester even though the price is no keener than that offered by the MMB in England). If the Scottish MMB were to be freed from the constraints of the statutory scheme ahead of the MMB in England, it would be possible for the new Scottish co-operative to offer keen 'introductory' price terms to selected buyers in England with a view to gaining market share there. The English MMB would be unable to retaliate without reducing the price it receives from all of its milk sold for the liquid market."</p></q>
The amendment seeks to deal with the distortions that might occur under certain conditions. The federation adds:
	<br><q><p>"Clearly, so long as milk producers … are tied into the English MMB the Scottish Co-operative could only meet the requirements of any new trade in England by drawing milk out of lower value manufacturing outlets in Scotland to the detriment of these organisations. It should be noted here that this is already happening to the extent that milk is going to Lancashire Dairies, although the scale is small.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>The longer term aspiration of the Scottish Co-operative would be to recruit additional farmers, most obviously in the North of England, to provide adequate milk for its increased market requirements, but there is little doubt that it would be prepared to exploit market advantage in the short term without having adequate milk supplies available to it because of the relative attractiveness of the liquid milk market."</p></q>
That is an example of how the market might be distorted. The amendment seeks to build into the considerations of Ministers who decide these matters a commitment to ensure that the interests of producers and purchasers of milk are reasonably taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's initial remarks about pressing amendments to a Division, I understand that he is not fundamentally opposed to the Bill's
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>156</span>
purposes—at least in certain respects—so he is fulfilling his role by probing for clarification and explanation. That is a perfectly normal and responsible function. I hope that nobody will judge the efficiency of any hon. Member by the number of Divisions that are forced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could qualify what the Minister has said. There are parts of the Bill on which we agree, but clearly there are parts on which we do not agree. Certainly, next Tuesday there will be a series of Divisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to engage in constitutional debate; I merely wish to acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the milk marketing board were to favour Dairy Crest in the run up to vesting day, that would contravene European Community regulations. The regulations have primacy over United Kingdom legislation, so a means of prevention is already in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sorry? I do not follow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall say it again. I understand that the hon. Gentleman is worried that in the run up to vesting day it might be possible to skew the scheme so as to depart from the equilibrium that, by agreement, will govern the scheme's rules—in other words, to depart from what Ministers had agreed and sanctioned. If there were an attempt to favour Dairy Crest, it would immediately run headlong into Community rules and into problems with Brussels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is redundant. We must consult representatives of producers and processors as well as consumers and retailers on the principles of the scheme. We could not approve the reorganisation scheme unless we were satisfied that practices described in the board's statement on the proposed selling arrangements of each proposed milk trading successor body took account of the interests of purchasers. When approving the scheme, we should have to have regard to whether it took account of the interests of producers of milk. We should already have considered the interests of producers and purchasers when approving the reorganisation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There comes a point at which one must simply get on with the plan and carry it out. Any doubt about the board's powers could lead to disputes and to delay in the implementation of the scheme. I do not think that there is a real problem. The board must get on with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fears of the Scottish DTF about distortion north and south of the border are a little exaggerated. If the Scottish co-op took the England and Wales board's markets, the joint committee, which of course will still exist in England and Wales, would respond sensibly. It might sell the milk that could no longer be sold in England into the Scottish market. It is obviously desirable that all the schemes should come into force on the same day. I believe that the hon. Member for Workington wished to help to bring that about. We agree that it would be helpful if all could come into force on the same day so that there would be no risk, however, hypothetical, of a dislocation. I do not think that it is such an imperative as to throw all the reorganisation schemes into disarray. I appreciate the

Clause 9(1)(b) provides:
	<br><q><p>"The appropriate authority shall satisfy itself, in relation to an approved scheme—" …</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"(b) that it does not, during that period, become expedient, by virtue of a change of circumstances, that there should be an increase in the provision made by the scheme for meeting liabilities retained by the relevant board after the transfer under section 10".</p></q>
The amendment is a probing one, which is intended to do no more than establish whether Ministers have yet been made fully aware of standing liabilities that might arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are Ministers aware of all the outstanding areas of controversy, where claims might be made and where liabilities might arise? We have all received correspondence, which we shall deal with in detail later, from Cricket St. Thomas and the direct selling organisations. They refer to a number of cases; there are varying legal views about whether those cases will be won and whether compensation might be paid, both for loss of business and for the legal fees that they have been required to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the views of the Dairy Trade Federation, which said:
	<br><q><p>"The phrase 'necessary or expedient' is used elsewhere in the Agriculture Bill (eg clause 13(3)(b), page 9, line 16) and it is worth probing to discover the implications of omitting the word 'necessary' here. On the face of it an unfavourable court case, for example, would indeed make it 'necessary' rather than merely 'expedient' to increase the provision for liabilities. The Minister should perhaps be reminded that the unsatisfactory unwinding of the Milk Marketing Schemes carries the potential for litigation."</p></q>
We are trying to establish to what extent Ministers are appraised of the potential liabilities that would arise from the ending of the current arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether I might deal with a point that was raised earlier today about the withdrawal of the scheme—ifthis is a convenient moment—when Ministers can insist on a change to a scheme. Under clauses 5 and 6, Ministers cannot insist on a variation or withdrawal of a scheme. It is for the board to apply for variation or approval and for Ministers then to decide whether to grant the applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 specifies circumstances in which Ministers can prevent a scheme from going ahead or require a change before vesting day. Ministers can prevent a scheme from going ahead if the board has failed to supply information
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>158</span>
that may be required under the clause, has failed to carry out the scheme in a material respect or if Ministers consider it expedient for the board to increase the amount of assets retained by its residuary board but the board does not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are defined circumstances in which the Minister can act, but the Minister may wish to act in circumstances that are not defined. He has already promised to consider that matter, perhaps he can deal with it on Report. The Bill may not at present deal with all the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. I did not wish to give further clarification, but I hoped that the clarification that I am able to give now would be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington asked whether we have details of all potential liabilities. I think that we have the details of most of them, but we shall put a fully comprehensive list together before approving a scheme for reorganisation. We shall then need to take a view of the likely outcome of each case. As the hon. Gentleman knows, we are talking mainly of court cases. The liabilities are effectively the unknown outcome of court cases. Therefore, the clause insists that we have to take a view—a judgment—which is a matter of guesswork. The hon. Member for Bristol, East (Ms. Corston) has already praised lawyers' dexterity in that matter. It seems, therefore, that the residuary board must have some funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be a pattern in the outcome of the cases and we might see the direction in which the Euruopean Court is steering. It might then be necessary to ask the board to make further resources available. Therefore, we must monitor what is going on. We can require extra money for the residuary board if necesary. Of course, it is a matter of judgment. The word "expedient" shows that it is a matter of judgment. The word "necessary" implies that one could have a precise notion—which we cannot, because it would anticipate the outcome of court cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of the information that the Minister has thus far, is there any indication of the potential scale of such problems that may exist? Plainly, in such circumstances, the worst case must be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to put a cash figure on it. One big case that I imagine will come up relatively shortly is the low-fat milk case, which will challenge whether a certain category of production—which is quite large in the way that the market has developed—is embraced within the statutory scheme. I shall not hazard a judgment about whether the board will or will not lose that case—the matter will be sorted out in court. But plainly, if the board lost that case, there would be serious consequences. A large number of producers would be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other cases are rumbling on. The board has engaged producers in litigation to a considerable extent and so a considerable number of cases remain to be dealt with. Some are dependent on decisions of the European Court of Justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with great interest. The Minister has much experience of European institutions. Surely almost as imporant as the likely price tag is the timetable. If these matters can be cleared before vesting

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>159</span>
day, there may be more freedom of manouvre thereafter and the residuary body may not be in such difficult circumstances when dealing with the likely liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether the Minister can be more forthcoming. He spoke of a relatively short time. In Brussels and other European capitals, a "relatively short time" seems to be different from how we regard it in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the most helpful course would be for me to ascertain information about the likely timetable for the cases that we know about and their resolution. I should be willing to circulate a letter to the Committee, giving that information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be most helpful. We look forward to reading with great interest that schedule of potential liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I talk to producers outside, I sometimes worry whether they know the scale of past and present litigation and of the claims that might be made. I draw the Committee's attention to one that is quite fascinating. An article in 	<i>Dairy Industry Development</i>—I think that is a Northern Ireland journal—stated:
	<br><q><p>"Four years ago milk producer—processor Eammon Cunningham joined forces with six other farmers to form Strathroy Milk Marketing and effectively broke the N. Ireland Milk Marketing Board's monopoly as the only milk buyer in the Province."</p></q>
The matter ended up in the courts, with the Scottish milk marketing board bringing an action. The article adds:
	<br><q><p>"The company's success so far has been achieved in spite of prolonged and continuing legal battles with the MMB. 'The first major blow came in 1991 when the MMB took legal action to prevent us from selling raw milk in the UK', explains Mr. Cunningham. Undeterred the company built up English markets for its skimmed milks and cream. Among its customers were the Tesco stores in the Liverpool and Manchester area, who accounted for most of the 220,000 litres shipped each day to the mainland."</p></q>
The article goes on to deal with a recruiting drive:
	<br><q><p>"According to Mr. Agnew, The legal action was taken to stop the company selling whole milk and low fat milk on the UK liquid market. Prior to 1991 the company had been selling increasing quantities of milk which had been withheld from the board for export, on the UK liquid market, both in N. Ireland and in Great Britain. The Board sought to curtail this action, which it considered illegal, and to preserve, for the benefit of all producers, the premium return available from the liquid milk market."</p></q>
The article refers to the matter being dealt with in court:
	<br><q><p>"The case has yet to be resolved and should the courts find in Strathroy's favour, the NIMMB could face a compensation claim for about £20 million for loss of business as a result of the injunction."</p></q>
We are talking about substantial sums of money. The Cricket St. Thomas case and others involve substantial claims. We wonder how long they will drag on and perhaps interfere with the distribution of money from the sale of assets, and to what extent the board's residuary body will have to be retained to deal with outstanding substantial liabilities. The MMB was not necessarily responsible for that because it applied the law as it thought it should apply, but people contested that to try to break the scheme. They may end up having to pay a substantial price.

We do not know what will be necessary concerning the residuary body and liabilities, so we have made a judgment that the board must make resources available to the residuary body.

A later clause provides that, as a last resort, the residuary body will have the power to impose a levy on producers to meet liabilities.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 118 to 125 would add a development council to the bodies to which assets could be transferred. The present definition of successor bodies would allow the assets to be passed to a new co-operative or to a new company that has not yet carried on business. That provision is too wide and we want to limit it to companies that are not yet trading. "Carrying on business" could be deemed to mean simply writing to people and providing information on what a company intends to do. We want a more precise definition.

We discussed the development council and we all want it to be able to receive assets.

Amendments Nos. 126 to 132 are drafting amendments, on the advice of lawyers, to remove redundant words.

Workington that the amendments have no impact on the substance of our future debate on the Potato Marketing Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to say a few words about the development council to which the Minister referred, in the light of conversations and correspondence with organisations including the National Farmers Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 27 April, the Minister said:
	<br><q><p>"We would probably require a poll of producers, and we would certainly seek representations from processors." [	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 27 April 1993; c. 128.]</p></q>
Those comments caused concern to various organisations, and perhaps I can clarify the matter. The key problem is the satisfaction of the requirement under section 1(3) of the Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947:
	<br><q><p>"Before making a development council order the Board or Minister concerned shall consult any organisation appearing to them or him to be representative of substantial numbers of persons carrying on business in the industry and such organisations representative of persons employed in the industry as appear to the Board or Minister concerned to be appropriate."</p></q>
Section 1(4) of the same Act states:
	<br><q><p>"A development council order shall not be made unless the Board or Minister concerned is satisfied that the establishment of a development council for the industry is desired by a substantial number of the persons engaged in the industry."</p></q>
I understand that is interpreted by the Department as probably requiring a poll, which has caused concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFU believes that a poll of producers is not an absolute requirement. It argues that the functions to be undertaken by the development council are currently undertaken by the milk marketing board or jointly with the Dairy Trade Federation through the joint committee. The proposed levy, it says, will only replace the current expenditure undertaken by the milk marketing board on behalf of all milk producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That expenditure is approved annually at the milk marketing board's annual general meeting, and there is no proposal to increase expenditure over current levels. In fact, it is likely that there would be a significant reduction in the expenditure by producers as there is no proposal for producers to become involved in generic advertising in future. The NFU quotes Halsbury in support of that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern is being expressed that the Minister, in referring to the need for a poll, might invite further delay, which could slow the transfer of assets—which we discussed on previous amendments. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that when he said
	<br><q><p>"probably require a poll of producers,"</p></q>
he meant "probably"—not that there would have to be a poll.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I used the word advisably—I confirm that the hon. Member for Workington's understood correctly. I said that we would probably require a poll of producers, and I am about to check whether I got that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for polling is that we must be assured of substantial levels of support. This involves the statutory levy under the Agriculture Act 1947. The Government do not believe that a statutory levy should be imposed without a substantial majority approval of those who will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>162</span>
be levied, because that step is not to be taken lightly. But reorganisation of the scheme should not be delayed—that is a separate issue. As I said, because it is a statutory levy, and because other bodies such as the horticultural development councils held polls when they wanted to reorganise, a poll would be consistent. I do not have an absolutely religious view on that, and I am willing to take advice on the exact legal position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that delay should not arise, but "should not" does not necessarily mean that there will be no delay. If there were, it would have implications for other parts of the Bill—certainly for the transfer of assets. To what extent are consultations taking place to ensure that these will not be a delay? If there has to be a poll, it may have to be held soon. The NFU's view is that, due to its nature, it may represent people with an interest in ensuring the constitution of the development council. In that case, a poll might not be necessary. My objective is to highlight the possibility of a delay that none of us would want and that might be detrimental to implementing changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We expect the industry to propose a development council after Royal Assent. Therefore, we would have some time to set it up before 1 April 1994.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment allows us to debate the conduct of the board after property rights and liabilities have been dispensed with or transferred to a successor body under an approved scheme. As worded, the Bill provides for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>163</span>
regulations, if necessary, to be introduced to govern the constitution of the board. The amendment would extend the regulations to cover the operations. Ministers might ask, "which operations?" None of us is privy to the intimate, contractual affairs of the board. What happens, however, if the residuary board refuses to carry out acts that Ministers believe should be carried out? What happens if the board is locked in argument with Ministers on the detail of final wind-up? Of the amendment the DTF comments:
	<br><q><p>"This relates to the residuary MMB which after the formation of Milk Marque will wind up the affairs of the present MMB. Some of these affairs will relate to dairies: for example, any outstanding contractual disputes relating to milk purchased under the Scheme. Therefore, the 'operations' of the residuary MMB are potentially a matter of importance to dairies."</p></q>
We want to be satisfied that no operations of the residuary body might be of concern to Ministers. If they are not of concern to Ministers, the amendment is irrelevant. However, should any matters arise subsequently, over which Ministers feel that they should have jurisdiction or influence, the amendment may prove important. I ask the Minister seriously to take on board our proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause. I appreciate why the hon. Gentleman has tabled what may be a probing amendment and why my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Marland) has also tabled an amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 deals with the situation in which an approved reorganisation scheme has been implemented. Implementation will only take place following considerable discussion. Therefore I am certain that, at that stage, the Government would not be locked in argument with the boards about the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each milk marketing board will need to continue in residuary form after revocation of the milk marketing scheme in order to wind up its affairs. The Bill provides for the termination of the terms of office of existing board members. It empowers Ministers, if they wish, to make regulations before the vesting date, setting out the constitution and functions of the residuary board. When Ministers are satisfied that the board's affairs have been wound up, they are required to dissolve it by order. The word "operations" in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Workington is unnecessary. Clause 13(2)(b)(ii) already provides for Ministers to make regulations enabling a board to wind up its affairs. That must include the board's operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary. The hon. Gentleman may, however, wish to raise other points in relation to subsequent important amendments to the clause. We shall fully consider his point when we make regulations specifying the constitution of the board, if there is a dispute between the residuary board and Ministers. The regulations will be subject to the negative resolution procedure, which provides another fall-back position. The Government believe that the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may take a legal mind to untangle what I am about to say, but the Minister said
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>164</span>
that clause 13(2)(b)(ii) deals with my point. It provides that Ministers may make regulations
	<br><q><p>"for the purpose of enabling the board to wind up its affairs."</p></q>
But is there not a distinction between introducing regulations for the purpose of enabling the board to wind up its affairs and regulations governing the operations of the board? Do Ministers not see that distinction? Are Ministers saying that the phrase,
	<br><q><p>"for the purpose of enabling the board to wind up its affairs"</p></q>
will cover all the circumstances in which it is necessary to influence events relating to the operations of a residuary body? I know that it is a split hair, but it only takes an awkward cuss on the board to start arguing about the interpretation of the grounds upon which Ministers might wish to introduce regulations—and that person may be prepared to drive it into the courts. That is all it would take to negate the power that I think Ministers should have to intervene in the board's operations. If Ministers can give me an absolute assurance that that is covered, I shall not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman that assurance. I think that he is, perhaps, looking for difficulties that do not exist. The purpose of the residuary board is to wind up the board's affairs. The phrase certainly covers its operations. We have considered the matter carefully and are convinced that the residuary board lacks none of the powers required to wind up the affairs of each board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 9, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(iii) in relation to establishing an arbitration panel for the purpose of deciding upon claims which may be made against the board.".</p></q>
The amendment is clear. It seeks the establishment of an arbitration panel to decide on claims that may be made against the residuary body. It gives us the opportunity to discuss the problems and worries of the direct sellers of milk who produce, pasteurise, bottle and sell milk directly to the consumer. They exist in various parts of the kingdom—Somerset, Devon, on the slopes of the Pennines, Northern Ireland—where they offer competition to the board. They often provide a doorstep delivery service and it is fair to say that they are kindly regarded by the consumers of their milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Direct sellers of milk have many problems. The Cricket St. Thomas estate has been in conflict with the board for many years. I shall comment on the rights and wrongs of its claims, which are subject to much discussion and litigation. There are a number of outstanding complaints against the board, including the contention that the liquid premium is illegal. The farmers are concerned about the direct sellers' levy. On Second Reading in the other place Earl Howe described the levy as one that direct sellers must pay to the board. It is nearly 2.4p per pint on the sale of whole milk and is a charge similar to that of corkage in a restaurant. The direct sellers have resisted the levy for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another complaint is about low-fat milk, an issue which has been considered by the Commission. The Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>165</span>
said earlier today that some of the matters will be settled by the European Court, and this is one of them. The fact that it is necessary to go to the European Court shows how difficult and complicated those matters are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another complaint by the Cricket St. Thomas estate is that the board has, in its view, used levies illegally to fund commercial activities. It is also concerned about the disciplinary committees that operate within the board. Self-regulation within an organisation often leads to many problems. The estate also believes that Dairy Crest withheld milk for export. Finally, it claims that the board's position on its ice cream sales has cost the direct sellers of milk much money. For that reason, it is making a claim against the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cricket St. Thomas estate, and all the direct sellers and their organisations, believe that this is a David and Goliath situation. The direct sellers are small, independently owned organisations. They believe that they are taking on the resources of a great Goliath which is funded by many supporters in its army.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Litigation costs money. I have seen figures that show that it has cost the direct sellers, so far, about £1 million to pursue these matters. Clearly, they are at a disadvantage in relation to the milk marketing boards, which have many more resources and much more backing. They can play for time. That creates no satisfaction for direct sellers and producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, Hildale, which has been described as a model producer co-op, has an outstanding claim against a board. However, the co-operative has gone into liquidation and its owners gain no pleasure from knowing that, at some date in the future, they may receive compensation. The business has gone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks, in a straightforward way, to point out that complicated matters are best settled by the residuary body and by arbitration. The Minister is keen to see the boards wound up. He knows that there is a need for a residuary body, but clearly there is a desire for that body to be wound up at the earliest opportunity. The residuary body cannot be wound up while litigation continues. It is in everyone's interest that a way of settling disputes amicably can be found through the arbitration panel. I understand that discussions are taking place between the various parties to try to resolve such matters without going to the courts. The amendment would provide a solution or process that is in everyone's interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want these issues to be resolved quickly. I am sure that the boards and the residuary body also want them to be resolved quickly. I know that the direct sellers support the process that the amendment proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to repeat the points made by the hon. Member for Sherwood, but I want to underline some further aspects of the issue. In the light of previous debates, I should declare my non-interest in the law. I am not a lawyer and have no intention of becoming one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree that if the problems faced by the residuary body are not settled before vesting date, there are likely to be long drawn out proceedings. That is why I expressed an interest in obtaining a timetable from the Minister. I am grateful to him for saying that he will be able to provide one. All members of the Committee, and all the parties, want the residuary bodies to be as short lived as possible. We do not want UHT; we want something that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>166</span>
has a firm sell-by date. We do not want rumps continuing for years after vesting date. That would be extremely expensive and would create uncertainty at a time when we want to create certainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has great merit. It could provide short cuts to getting rid of some of the outstanding matters. If we have to wait for the European Court to deal with matters, such as the low fat milk case, we shall probably have to wait until the cows come home. In those circumstances, the Committee and the Government have an interest in anything that can be done to provide a quicker route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its notes on the clause and the amendments, the board suggests that the courts and existing arbitration methods should be sufficient. There is a considerable question mark against that, particularly for small direct sellers to whom the hon. Member for Sherwood referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some parties—perhaps the board—may be extensively and expensively advised on such matters. They may be prepared to string things out and play for time. That would be unfair to a number of smaller organisations, which would be ground into the dust by elongation of the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the board's costs in the liquid milk levy case that was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood amount to £400,000? These costs do not include the Cricket St. Thomas costs. The case has been going on since 1983. I want to reinforce my hon. Friend's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is valid. I hope that I shall not be accused of using the adjective in a pejorative way when I say that that is a conservative estimate. The lawyers' fees and the law industry appear to be the only growth industry. Anything that we can do when examining the Bill to prevent that becoming a cause célèbre for yet more years would be to the advantage of not just the parties but Milk Marque and the other new boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment, which was spoken to by the hon. Member for Sherwood, is interesting. I take the point made by the hon. Member for North Cornwall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Government's view, the residuary body is responsible for winding up affairs until they are all completed, like the hon. Member for North Cornwall, I hope that that will take place as speedily as possible. He is not a lawyer, nor am I. One reads in newspapers of interminable delays in the law courts, particularly in civil actions. It is no use he or I trying to put a date on when the outstanding liabilities of the milk boards concerned will be wound up. It would be unfair to those litigants who are taking action against the board, or vice versa, if such action were precluded by a time scale laid down by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider whether proceeding to arbitration would be right and fair. That was mentioned by the hon. Member for Sherwood. All of us like to think that any arbitration procedure is fair and almost inevitably a form of compromise. However, the resolution of serious cases, such as that which relates to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0098">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>167</span>
the Cricket St. Thomas issue—the direct seller's liability for levy—has nothing to do with the Government. The case has to go through the courts, which must deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would it be fair for court cases, that perhaps will proceed during the next year or two via the usual procedure, suddenly to be cut off in their prime and determined by arbitration? The Government feel that it would be unfair not to allow the normal course of the law to proceed, during which both sides have a proper opportunity in open court to put their case before the judiciary. I believe that that is right. The decision to go to arbitration could be relatively marginal. It has certain attractions, but it would be far better to let outstanding cases—both before and after vesting day—take their normal course through the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recommend the hon. Member for Sherwood to withdraw amendment No. 45, because I believe that the board should have full responsibility. Whether the board loses or wins, it will be the responsibility of the residuary board to wind up the financial aspects. The residuary board has no escape from its duties to fulfil its responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the whole, I believe that it would be better to let cases procede through the courts than to set up an arbitration procedure. Although the later course might be a quicker way of reaching a solution, it could be unfair to one side or the other where cases have been carefully prepared by lawyers, who would probably like to see them concluded in open court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister with great interest. He clearly understands the issue and shares much of the worries raised in the debate. It is also clear that he would like to see the residuary body wound up as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to enocourage that process, to set up an arbitration panel, to encourage the warring parties to go that way and to deny the lawyers the fees that have been talked of this morning with prurient interest. The amendment does not block off legal pursuit of a case. Clearly, we do not have the power to do that. If the parties want to wage war for ever, that must be a matter for them. We might think them foolish, but we cannot deny them the chance to do that. I hope that those who regard the report of our debate will use arbitration rather than the law, but I want to reinforce the point that the amendment does not block off expensive litigation, if the parties cannot see sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The government are missing an important factor in the debate about Cricket St. Thomas. We are talking about moneys that, unless they are paid in compensation are paid to producers. There are thus two claims on those assets—producers' claims, because producers will be the beneficiaries of the winding up of the board, and the calls of processors and direct sellers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers might not want to see litigation going on for years. They may ask the residuary body to get those cases sorted out. If they understood the detail of the Bill, they would ask why the Bill did not provide a framework for such matters to be dealt with by arbitration.

Mr. Taylor says in his letter to Mr. J. W. Hepburn, the under-secretary at the Department:
	<br><q><p>"I would like to point out that should these problems not be sorted out satisfactorily through negotiation before the Scheme comes to an end there will be continued litigation."</p></q>
The producers and the farmers must realise that litigation will continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of organisations threaten continued litigation. They challenge the distribution of assets by the residuary body of the milk marketing board. If I were a farmer I should want to evaluate whether I would win. If there were an element of doubt, I should probably suggest that a deal be done to get matters sorted out. That is the principle of arbitration. Ministers ought to take the point seriously. What is lost or conceded by giving into an amendment such as amendment No. 45? If it were part of the Bill, but not used, what would be lost? It might point to a way of resolving difficulties. Producers might then use this procedure, instead of going through the courts, where the man with the biggest pocket can last the longest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The writers of this angry correspondence have resolve and bottle. The tone of some of the language used in the letters, which I hope each member of the Committee has read, shows that they are a group of people who feel deeply angry. They feel genuinely that they have been mistreated. I understand the board's position and that it wished to protect it. In the context of the regime that currently exists and is being wound up, it was a perfectly sensible way to proceed, because it was protecting a milk marketing arrangement that has been successful for many decades. However, we are entering a new world. It is possible that there are some people who do not want the argument to run on interminably in the courts. I ask Ministers please to accept the amendment as a sensible proposal to include in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

which the authority—the Government—would decide whether to go to arbitration. His amendment would add sub-paragraph (iii) to clause 13(2)(b) so that the authority would
	<br><q><p>"by regulations make such provisions as it thinks fit</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(iii) in relation to establishing an arbitration panel".</p></q>
That would provide that the Government must decide whether cases should go to arbitration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has not taken on board the fact that there is no reason now why any two litigants should not go to arbitration voluntarily. This may happen under any legal scheme, and it will continue after vesting day. The Government's view is that neither side should be forced into arbitration when there is still the open court of law available to them. We believe that cases that are before the courts should proceed, and that people who wish to go before the courts should also be allowed to proceed, but if they wish to agree the issue between themselves, there is no reason why they should not go to arbitration. Indeed, a host of matters are resolved that way. The hon. Member for Workington would be taking away the right of individuals to proceed through the courts. It is important not to short-circuit speedy decisions. Some cases may be before the courts but not concluded. It would be wrong to use legislation to force another course upon them. We should leave open to them the two existing opportunities of going to court or to arbitration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that the Minister knows that many people outside want some kind of arbitration. They want everyone to be pointed in that direction. They want discussions to develop about the need to end, with an arbitrated solution, the saga of controversy between warring factions.

Why does the Minister not accept that simple proposition? It would not damage the Bill and it would point people in that direction. Is his attitude to the proposition set in stone? Is it at all flexible? Is there room for further consideration? Might the Government say on Report, "On reflection, there might be some room for flexibility"? Will the Minister try to reconsider and not to take so inflexible a view?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H.

The hon. Member for Workington is much more inflexible than I am. I leave both options open, but he leaves only one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment concerns consultation, the word that so frequently arises in our proceedings. It deals with regulations that the Government may wish to introduce in relation to the constitution of the boards and for the purpose of enabling a board to wind up its affairs. Clause 13(3)(b) states that the regulations may make such provision as the authority might think necessary or expedient. The amendment is intended to ensure that such regulations are the subject of consultation with the processors and organisations represented by the Dairy Trades Federation. I think that at this stage the board's affairs are to some extent the business of everyone—the DTF, the producers, the processors, or whoever. I am sure that such consultations could be held on a discreet basis if there were confidential matters to discuss. May we have the Government's view?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another consideration might be that the DTF would be aware of outstanding claims—which is why I spoke of discretion—arising from transactions carried out under the milk marketing scheme, or research contracts into which the milk marketing board might have entered. As we have already discussed, the DTF knows that other organisations have outstanding claims. Surely the Minister will want to be fully assured that nothing has been left outstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Marland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gloucestershire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are discussing my amendment at the same time as amendment No. 87, I should like to explain that it is a probing amendment. It is very important that there should be no loose ends left untied in the winding up of the milk marketing board and that every aspect should be taken into account. We are anxious that nothing should slip the net. However, Ministers have given reassurances on previous clauses. I am satisfied with what has been said so far, and I shall be interested in what the Minister will add.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot recall any legislation in more years than I care to remember that has had so much consultation built into it. I do not think that the Government or the boards, in their present position, will be able to move an inch either way without the most detailed consultation. From clause 3 onwards we have discussed in depth the amount of consultation that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not prevent the Government and the residuary board from holding the most detailed consultations on all the interests about which hon. Members are concerned. There is no doubt that producers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>171</span>
will want the board's affairs wound up as quickly as possible and the financial ends tied up and finished with, but we cannot speed up—I wish that we could—some of the legal processes. However, I am sure that the board will chase up every other aspect assiduously in order to reach a conclusion. We do not believe that it is necessary to include that requirement in the Bill, because the Government would not make regulations without giving interested parties an opportunity to comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The functions of the residuary board will be wide-ranging—from settling outstanding payments for milk to being responsible for potentially large liabilities, with the assets to meet them. Ministers may decide to consult interested parties to ensure that a board has fulfilled all its functions. We do not think that it is necessary to consult widely on dissolution if the board is settling only a few remaining accounts. Ministers could examine the final accounts to ensure that the matter is tied up satisfactorily: no doubt the accounts will be audited before the board is finally dissolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the board has been wound up, the only outstanding issue will be when the Minister should dissolve the residuary board, and it will not be necessary to consult in depth thereafter. All the accounts and liabilities will have been dealt with, and that will be the end of the board. In future, there will be the new development council and co-operatives and they will have other official duties after vesting day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an unnecessary amendment. I hope that after my firm indication that the residuary board will be responsible for winding up the board's affairs and that there will be adequate consultation between the residuary board, the boards and the authority, there will be no need for further amendments to this clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This also is a probing amendment. Bearing in mind the fate that befell my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, it is with some temerity that I move it. I cannot see the point of having consultations after the affairs of any group have been wound up. It would be like shutting the door after the horse has bolted.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir H. Monro</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment, but perhaps my hon. Friend has got things the wrong way around.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 20, in page 9, line 32, after "shall", insert ", with the agreement of the board,".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a probing amendment. As drafted, clause 14 states:
	<br><q><p>"(1) This section applies where the revocation of a milk marketing scheme by section 1(1) above takes place without property, rights or liabilities of the board constituted by it having been transferred under section 10 above."</p></q>
That sounds complicated. It continues:
	<br><q><p>"(2) The appropriate authority shall present a petition for the winding up of the board in accordance with the milk marketing scheme and Schedule 2 to the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(3) If, in the event of the board being so wound up, any assets of the board remain after the discharge of its debts and liabilities and the payment of the costs and expenses incurred in the winding up, those assets shall be distributed to the producers who would have been by virtue of paragraph 5 of Schedule 2 to the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 liable to contribute in the winding up, and shall be so distributed in proportion to their respective liabilities in that behalf."</p></q>
Do Ministers foresee any conditions in which the revocation of a milk marketing scheme will take place without the property rights or liabilities of a board having been transferred?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) implies that Ministers will use the 1958 Act to wind up a board. The amendment seeks to prevent Ministers from acting precipitately in that the agreement of the board would have to be secured before any action was taken. The board may wish to liquidate its assets at the convenience of Ministers. The price might be wrong. At a meeting some weeks ago, Mr. Dare told us that he could not even get £1 million for Thames Ditton. Plainly, there is a question about when assets may have to be distributed. Perhaps there should be a delay in the distribution of assets if the property market is not especially good at a particular time. The argument is whether the boards should perhaps be driven into a forced sale; they may be under pressure, but may believe that such action is not necessarily in the interests of producers awaiting the distribution of the assets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment relates, as it were, to a doomsday scenario—to what would happen if, after all the discussions, plans and projects, a replacement has not been agreed? The scheme will have been abolished by the Bill. Therefore, it would be illogical if the scheme had been brought to an end, but the board still existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only circumstances in which the 1958 Act foresees the board being wound up are insolvency. Therefore, it deals only with what would happen to liabilities. In effect, this clause means that the assets, too, must be dealt with in such circumstances. A Minister may decide that a board is now redundant and so the surplus assets should be distributed to producers. In effect, the provision closes a loophole that was not envisaged at the time of the 1958 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill gives the board adequate time to prepare its reorganisation schemes and to discuss and implement the

approved scheme. The deadline for the revocation of the milk marketing scheme can, if necessary, be extended until the end of December 1995, although we do not want such a delay. If, at the end of the day, the board cannot or will not implement a reorganisation scheme and Government policy is that the milk marketing scheme and the board should, nevertheless, be wound up, we cannot wind up the scheme and not the board. Therefore, it is not acceptable to allow the board to block change and to continue indefinitely. The clause aims to deal with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals with any proposals by the board to set up a scheme for raising levies to pay off liabilities. Clause 16 states:
	<br><q><p>"The appropriate authority may, on the application of the board, by order give effect to a scheme enabling the board to require eligible producers to make contributions for the purpose of enabling it to meet its liabilities."</p></q>
The amendment is a further attempt to ensure that future liabilities are fully considered in the event that it might become necessary to raise a levy to fund liabilities. Could there be more than one levy? We presume that one levy will be raised but there might be a subsequent levy. Does the legislation deal with that possibility- If not, perhaps that could be amended on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is yes, there could be more than one levy.

In that sense, the aims of the amendment are met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>"(f) that eligible producers have been consulted in a way satisfactory to Ministers.".</p></q>
The amendment emphasises again that there is inadequate consultation in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 16(2) enables Ministers to give power to the board to raise a levy. However, Ministers can only do so if they are satisfied that
	<br><q><p>"(a) the board's assets are insufficient to meet its liabilities;</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(b) that the board has taken all reasonable steps to minimise the amount required to meet its liabilities;</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>174</span>
	<br><q><p>(c) that there is no other reasonably practicable way of discharging its liabilities;</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(d) that the amount proposed to be raised under the scheme is reasonable"—</p></q>
after the lawyers' bills have been paid—and
	<br><q><p>"(e) that the basis on which contributions are to be assessed under the scheme is reasonable."</p></q>
The amendments aims to add a further condition:
	<br><q><p>"(f) that eligible producers have been consulted in a way satisfactory to Ministers."</p></q>
That would ensure that producers had a say in the raising of the levy. I should have thought that Ministers would want to accept the amendment because producers have an interest in the levy—they have to pay, and so should be satisfied about paragraphs (a) to (e) of subsection (3). Will the Minister concede that farmers have an interest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause envisages what we all hope will be exceptional circumstances. They concern what happens when the residuary body's liabilities become so great that the only way to raise the resources to meet them is to levy producers. I have already said that, in such circumstances, any assets that remained when all the liabilities had been met, should be returned to producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The levy would be raised from producers who had benefited from the distribution of assets. There would be an exact congruence between those who would benefit from the assets and those who would be liable to pay the levy. At the end of the day, in such circumstances, there would be no alternative but to levy producers. There is no other source from which the residuary body could find funds to meet liabilities that were incurred when those producers signed up to the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is absolutely right, but what will happen when there is a small shortfall in resources, and the cost of the poll and collection of a levy exceeds the amount that is required to settle the outstanding liability? Would not it be sensible for the Minister to have a little room to manoeuvre? Perhaps public funds could prevent that shortfall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There would be no poll. The residuary board would be empowered to raise the levy. If the levy was small, the Government may reconsider. Perhaps the hon. Member for North Cornwall will allow me to reflect on what might happen if a very small amount had to be raised. However, that would not invalidate the general point that, in the circumstances that the clause is intended to meet, there would be no alternative to levying producers. Ultimately, they will either be levied or they will not. There is no way around that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not answer my point. I proposed that farmers should be asked what they think about the proposals. I agree with much of what the Minister said, but why should not farmers be part of the process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My answer is fairly brutal. If farmers were asked whether they wanted to pay a levy, they would probably say no. If I were consulted by the Inland Revenue about whether I wanted to pay tax, the chances are that I would say no. However, if the board has to find those resources and that source is the only one available, even farmers who do not like the idea will have to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but they may not be completely satisfied about how those matters have been dealt with by the board. They may say, "We should have been consulted about the issues arising from paragraphs (a) to (e) in clause 16(3)." Why should not they have the right to consultation? Will decisions be taken by that body on the basis of, "Don't worry about it—we'll take the decision. All you have to do is to pay the bill." Farmers may have been recipients of moneys from the distribution of assets but, at the end of the day, they could be required to pay out money. One would have thought that the legislation would at least allow them the opportunity to say a word or two, because the money will come out of their pockets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of a right to be consulted, a producer may want legally to challenge the way in which those matters are dealt with by the board.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. You will note that, in a point of order early in our proceedings, I asked the Minister to make a statement. You rightly ruled that was not a point of order. The Minister said that he might be able to tell the Committee what happened in Brussels. Will he place that information on the board tomorrow so that, prior to the weekend, we are well-versed on the state of play of the negotiations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hill. I did not think that hon. Members would be here tomorrow, as I imagined that many of them would want to get away early today. However, I shall put that information on the board as soon as it can be provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Adjourned at fifteen minutes to One o 'clock till Tuesday 4 May at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
