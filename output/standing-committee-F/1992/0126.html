<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 178, in page 42, line 4, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>",and there shall be added the words 'and any set of activities or services which on or after the transfer constitute an identifiable economic entity or unit'."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 183, in page 42, line 27, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(7) At the end of Regulation 3 there shall be inserted—
<br><blockquote><p>'(6) It is hereby declared that the award of a contract for the provision of services is not a relevant transfer,'".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister, I know that the Committee will be interested to hear that I spoke to the joint Chairman, Mr. Hogg, the other day and that he is making slow but sure progress. He will not be back for a while.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee will be delighted to hear that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying when we adjourned last Thursday—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman could not have been on his feet when we adjourned. The Committee can adjourn only if a member of the Committee is not on his feet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are concerned, in one way or another, with the question of the transfer of undertakings regulations and contracting out.<br><br>
I shall start with amendment No. 181, which puzzled me greatly when I first saw it. Subsection (2) of the clause would change the definition of the word "undertaking" in the regulations, removing the existing restriction to transfers of undertakings which are—
<br><blockquote><p>"In the nature of a commercial venture".</p></blockquote>
That change has received a considerable—and, I have to say, unwarranted—amount of attention in the press.<br><br>
What struck me as odd was the fact that the amendment seeks to prevent the Government removing the existing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
retriction. In other words, the Opposition apparently wanted the scope of the transfer regulations to be restricted to undertakings
<br><blockquote><p>"which are in the nature of a commercial venture".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) explained at our last sitting, however, that the amendment was intended primarily as a focus for the explanation of my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General. That being the case, I imagine that he does not seriously wish the amendment to be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson<span class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I happily confirm that the amendment was intended as a contrivance to enable the Attorney-General to appear before the Committee when he wanted to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In which case, in the spirit of the good relations that have dominated the Committee, I shall not disappoint the hon. Gentleman by recommending that my colleagues accept the amendment, tempted though I might have been had I thought that the words had the meaning which the hon. Gentleman thought that they had, although I should have been restrained by other circumstances.<br><br>
I made reference at our last sitting to comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, when he introduced the transfer regulations in December 1981. The record of the debate that followed makes interesting reading, as does the record of the debate when the regulations were introduced in another place a few days later.<br><br>
From those debates we learn something of the contents of the Opposition's 1978 draft regulations which, as we all know, were overtaken by a fortunate event in 1979.I have particularly in mind comments by the noble Lord, Lord McCarthy, at column 1486 of the <i>Official Report</i> for 10 December 1981. We learn, astonishingly enough, from those comments that the Opposition had intended to exclude from the scope of their regulations specified non-commercial ventures, which included charitable bodies, Government Departments and local authorities.<br><br>
That is puzzling. The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) told the Committee at some length at our last sitting that the 1981 regulations were drafted
<br><blockquote><p>"Clearly with a view to excluding compulsory competitive tendering from the scope of the acquired rights directive. That was manifestly the Government's intention."</p></blockquote>
When I questioned that description, helpfully pointing out that compulsory competitive tendering did not exist in 1981, the hon. Member said,
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no doubt that the Government clearly had compulsory competitive tendering in their sights when the regulations were being prepared."<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 21 January 1993; c. 524.]</p></blockquote>
Members of the Committee will now see why I said that I was puzzled. Am I to conclude that, in seeking to exclude local authorities from their own draft regulations, the Opposition had compulsory competitive tendering in their sights? Were they guilty of the same conspiracy that the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness, who has just joined the Committee, believes we were guilty of?<br><br>
I do not believe that the Labour Government intended to be party to any such conspiracy. It is clear, however, that the wording that they intended using would have been challenged by the Commission in the fullness of time and that changes would have been necessary. As the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0648">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 537</span>
Attorney-General explained at our previous sitting, the Government have agreed with the Commission that the commercial venture restriction is inappropriate and should be removed from the regulations. Subsection (2) of the clause must, therefore, stand.<br><br>
I turn now to amendment No. 178. The amendment would allow the subsection (2) change to be made, but would add to the definition of undertaking contained in the regulations. My first thought was that the amendment was intended simply to make it clear that the contracting out of services can come within the scope of the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given what the Minister has just claimed, can he tell the Committee what he thought Lord Waddington meant when, on 7 December 1981, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have done a great deal to mitigate some of the worst effects of the directive."? <i>[Official Report,</i> 7 December 1981; Vol. 14, c. 697.]</p></blockquote>
According to the Minister, the Government had not watered down the Opposition's proposals; they had watered them up.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the support of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) for my criticism of the remarks of his hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness. The hon. Gentleman said that the Government seemed to have watered up the proposals and that we had made the scope of the regulations wider than the position had been under the Labour Government, since the Opposition specifically excluded local authorities from the draft regulations.<br><br>
What Lord Waddington meant is clear. The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness was referring to the exchange that took place with my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, East (Sir eddy Taylor) about privatisation, when my noble Friend said what the Government have said repeatedly, and the Attorney-General told the Committee on Tuesday: that it was perfectly possible for local authority competitive tendering to come within the scope of the regulations.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras asked me about the enthusiasm of my noble Friend for the regulations. Let me make it clear that the regulations were not acceptable to Lord Waddington. They were introduced in response to a directive. The Government have no choice but to implement the terms of the directive, and I freely tell the Committee that, if I had the choice, I would have nothing to do with such regulations. It seems to me that terms and conditions of employment are a matter between employers and employees and not a matter for the House. The terms of the directive leave us no choice but to implement the regulations, which I very much regret; just as my noble Friend regretted it when he brought them before the House.<br><br>
Amendment No. 178 appears, on reflection, rather more ambitious than I first suspected. It might allow a variety of activities, which did not constitute an identifiable economic entity before the transfer, to be covered by the regulations so long as they become such an entity after the transfer. That would go further than the directive. The European Court of Justice has consistently said that the directive applies where an indentifiable economic entity preserves its identity. It has never
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 538</span>
suggested that disparate activities that become an indentifiable economic entity following a transfer should be covered. The Government cannot agree that the scope of the regulations be extended in that way.<br><br>
Finally, amendent No. 183, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Dr. Spink), seeks to remove the contracting out of services from the scope of the regulations. I understand why my hon. Friend tabled the amendment, but as I said at our previous sitting, the Government cannot accept it because to do so would put the United Kingdom in clear breach of the directive.<br><br>
Several of my hon. Friends have expressed concern about the scope and effect of the directive. An examination of the debates that took place when the regulations were introduced in the House shows that the practice has changed, in part because much has changed since 1981 as a result of the progressive and radical policies of Conservative Governments. The delivery of public services has been revolutionised through competitive tendering, which did not exist on such a scale in 1981. The scale of competitive tendering has resulted in hundreds of millions of pounds being made available for additional patient care, additional social services and other local authority activities which would never have taken place but for competitive tendering.<br><br>
The directive is written in language which is not precise—some might describe it as woolly. The growth of competitive tendering and the interpretation of the regulations, which was broadened by the Commission—it turned out to be broader than the House was informed in 1981—have created the concern about which my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point spoke.<br><br>
I should like to emphasise again that, if no more than a contract to provide a service is transferred, the regulations do not apply. Nothing in clause 26 will affect that. Equally, nothing could legally be added to the clause to free the competitive tendering process from the impact of the acquired rights directive.<br><br>
If my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point wants a remedy for the problem that he identified, it must be found in the amendment or annulment of the acquired rights directive—that is not a matter for the Committee or the House.<br><br>
In practice, the regulations have not generally applied where services have been contracted out, for the simple reason that no actual undertaking was being transferred, but in those cases where contracting out means that an undertaking is transferred as a going concern, the regulations will apply.<br><br>
I hope that, having heard that explanation, my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point will withdraw his amendment and that Opposition Members will feel able to withdraw amendments Nos. 181 and 178.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister's presentation was honest. Essentially, he does not like the clause or the regulations that will implement the European Community directive. If he could have his way, he would get rid of them.<br><br>
The Minister also tried to maintain the impression created by the Attorney General that nothing has changed. It is simply a rewording of the clause, which is probably minor and inconsequential. That was the basic thrust of the Attorney-General's presentation. However, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0649">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 539</span>
Minister is honest enough to believe that that is not really the case at all. Perception of the law has changed since 1981 following various court cases, and the position on compulsory competitive tendering is now different.<br><br>
Everyone accepts the proposition of the Minister and the Attorney-General that each case must be considered on its merits. The idea that the Government tried to create in 1981—the Minister wrote a pamphlet about the matter in late 1981, so it was part of Tory philosophy then—that compulsory competitive tendering would not fall within the TUPE regulations was not so and the Minister now admits that.<br><br>
10.45 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is still pursuing his rather odd theme. Will he explain why the Labour Government excluded local authorities? The noble Lord McCarthy criticised the phrase,
<br><blockquote><p>"not in the nature of a commercial venture"</p></blockquote>
and said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is a vague and strange term to English law and I am told it is bound to lead to dispute and litigation. The approach in the 1978 draft was a very considerable improvement on 2(1). At Regulation 3(4) it spelt out the actual exclusions which were to count as a non-commercial venture: for example, charitable bodies, Government Departments, local authorities and so on."—<i>(Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 10 December 1981; Vol. 425, c. I486.]</p></blockquote>
How can the hon. Gentleman criticise the Government when his noble Friend confirmed to the other place that the Labour Government thought it appropriate to exclude those categories?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Labour party sought a different perspective in the legislation. Benign Labour Governments looking on benign local authorities would never, in any circumstances, countenance local authorities doing anything to disadvantage their employees, so there would be no need to apply the TUPE regulations to local authorities.<br><br>
The Minister has always maintained that the regulations apply to contracting out and the various manifestations of that. We are discussing the issue of transfer and undertaking. The Attorney-General's position is that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"nature of a commercial venture"</p></blockquote>
should be removed because they exclude charities, and the decision should be made on the basis of whether the organisation forms an economic entity.<br><br>
The Minister is aware of the Expro Ltd. <i>v.</i> Smith case, which involved the Ministry of Defence contracting out a service. Judgment was made against Smith and the regulations on the basis that it was not a business—not a commercial venture. The Attorney-General was wrong to have said that that was of no consequence. The early cases against the regulations were dismissed on the grounds that a commercial venture was not involved because it was part of a local authority function. The effect of that, by design and by default, was to stop other cases coming before the courts. To maintain that the phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"in the nature of a commercial venture"</p></blockquote>
has changed nothing is not true and is not in accordance with what has happened in legal practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman again. Will he confirm that the case to which he referred is under appeal?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 540</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The sub judice rule does not apply in Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is correct.<br><br>
Since then there have been many European cases, to some of which the Attorney-General referred: the Spijkers case, in which the definition of "economic identity" was set out; the Redmond <i>v.</i> Bartol case, which determined the purpose of the regulations; and the Watson Rask case concerning a contracted-out canteen which, the Attorney-General decided, would fall within the regulations.<br><br>
The legal position has changed, so the directive must be interpreted widely and purposefully. There is no doubt that more and more cases of compulsory competitive tendering and other related contracts will fall within the directive. I realise that many of those cases will finally be settled in the courts, but to pretend, as the Attorney-General and the Minister have pretended, that nothing has changed does not accord with the facts. I think that the Minister appreciates that the position has changed. Perhaps that is why his Department is reputedly trying to rescind the EC directive. Will he state the Government's position regarding the directive? He will know of press reports of an alleged letter, to a Conservative Member, which reveals that the Department of Employment wants to have the EC directive rescinded on the grounds of subsidiarity. Will he confirm that that is the case? Will he also explain the position regarding retrospective action, in the light of the Franciovich case? Many employees will have been disadvantaged as a result of the Government not applying the TUPE regulations when they should have. Is not it correct and proper that such people should be able to take retrospective action against the way in which they have been disadvantaged, that that action should not be time barred and that the time should start when clause 26 becomes law?<br><br>
I think that the Minister accepts that more and more transactions concerning individuals will fall within the scope of the regulations. Those who have been disadvantaged ought to have the right to redress.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can respond briefly to the hon. Gentleman's points.<br><br>
In respect of the acquired rights directive, the position is that the Government would like the directive to be changed. The Government's position, which has been clearly spelt out on several occasions, is that we support the principle of subsidiarity. It seems to me that the acquired rights directive is one of those directives that ought to be examined carefully in the context of that doctrine of subsidiarity. As I have already suggested to the Committee, my own view is that terms and conditions of employment are a matter between employers and employees. In so far as any legislation is necessary—and I would need to be persuaded of that need—that is a matter for the House and not for any other body or organisation.<br><br>
The acquired rights directive was agreed by the previous Labour Government. It is perfectly clear from the exchanges that we have had and from reading <i>Hansard</i> that that Government had no idea what they were signing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0650">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 541</span>
up to and that, over the course of time, the interpretation of the regulations has been broadened in a way which, in my opinion, disadvantages the delivery of public services in this country.<br><br>
We should like the acquired rights directive to be amended. One of the difficulties with the European Community is the difficulty of making changes in the law as it stands. I freely acknowledge that difficulty. Clearly the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) enjoys my discomfort about that matter and has tried to draw it to the Committee's attention. As a Member of Parliament he should recognise that, from the point of view of either side of the Committee, it cannot be good if it is difficult to change laws that create a disadvantage. The Government's position on the acquired rights directive is clear.<br><br>
As for the point made by the hon. Gentleman on the Francovich judgment, I should point out to those Committee members who are unfamiliar with the details that the Francovich case arose because of a failure by the Italian Government to implement a directive. A case was brought by a person who had been disadvantaged, and it was held that he could seek compensation—I think that I have got that right.<br><br>
The case related to the failure of a member state to implement a directive. Clause 26, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General explained, makes minor changes to the regulations. It cannot be assumed that a particular case would have been decided differently had the changes which are now being made been made earlier. In any case, the Francovich case concerned a complete failure to implement a directive, which is different from these circumstances. It is open to any individual who believes that he has suffered loss to take action in the courts, but it is hard to envisage how that issue could arise in this context.<br><br>
Given what the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has said about lawyers on numerous occasions, I am pleased to confess that I am not a lawyer and that I am not here to give legal advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Robert Spink <span class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that there is a European legal gridlock. The United Kingdom Government want to disregard TUPE, but European Community legislation prohibits us from so doing.<br><br>
The principle of subsidiarity should apply. Only time can tell whether it will. That is a battle which I am sure you, Mr. Knox, will tell me must be fought elsewhere.<br><br>
I trust that, eventually, the European Community acquired rights directive will be rejected by this country when it is reviewed. As the directive needs unanimity, the United Kingdom can require that it fall, so we can tidy these issues up in the future. In the meantime, I entirely accept that clause 26 does not greatly change the legal position which we have enjoyed for many years, and that each question will be decided case-by-case in the light of case law. I am happy not to pursue my amendment, and I thank the Minister for his kind reassurance.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 123, in page 42, line 4, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) After Regulation 2(1) there shall be inserted—
<br><blockquote><p>'(A1) Where an employer does not recognise an independent trade union, he shall be deemed for the purpose of these Regulations to recognise an independent trade union,
<ol>
<li>when its representatives have been certified by ACAS as suitable for the purpose of these Regulations, or</li>
<li>In any case where ACAS recommends a ballot, where those representative have the support of a majority of the employees affected in a ballot organised under conditions approved by the Certification Officer.'."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 121, in clause 27, page 43, line 11, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(d) there shall be added the following subsection—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(9) For the purposes of this section, section 178(3) of this Act shall apply with the following words added to it:
<br><blockquote><p>'but where an employer does not recognise an independent trade union, he shall be deemed to recognise an independent trade union,
<ol>
<li>when its representatives have been certified by ACAS as suitable for the purpose of this section, or</li>

</ol></p></blockquote></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are concerned with the consultation that should take place under the acquired rights directive. Part of the thrust of the directive is not just that individuals should have their rights maintained and carried over when there is a change of contract of employment through a transfer of undertakings—we do not need to get into the legal niceties of that—but that there should be representations on their behalf. There should be discussions and consultations with the individuals to ensure that they do not wake up one morning and suddenly find that not only have they been transferred but that their terms and conditions of employment have been changed. In other words, that is the right of employees to be consulted collectively.<br><br>

We welcome the clause. Undeterred by the protestations of the Minister and the Attorney-General, we think that it would produce a significant legal and psychological change which would generate greater rights and greater pursuance of those rights. I should not discomfort the Minister in this way. I have not had so much fun in a long time, which goes to show that I do not have much fun in life. I thought I should say that before the Minister retaliated.<br><br>
The regulations have defects, which the amendments attempt to correct. There is a problem with the nature of the consultation that takes place between employers and employees. The directive states that the consultations, taking place within various statutory guidelines, should be with "representatives of the employees" which, according to the regulations, are recognised trade unions. That is a significant change. It would give the employer the ability to circumvent the regulations by not recognising a trade union. The regulations do not state that consultations have to take place with employees in the shape or form in which the employees might wish to engage. By not recognising a trade union, consultation would not be necessary.<br><br>
The amendment would be a possible way round that problem. As always, our amendments are not meant, because of obvious limitations, to be the last word in technical drafting. We are interested in what the Government have to say. If an employer does not recognise a trade union, would there be a statutory obligation for him to consult the employees?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can try to explain this complex area.<br><br>
As the transfer of undertakings regulations currently stand, both the old and new employers in a transfer are required to inform and consult representatives of an independent trade union, which they have chosen to recognise for the purposes of collective bargaining, in respect of any employees who are affected by the transfer. That is the case, whether or not the employees actually work in the undertaking which is to be transferred.<br><br>
Similarly, section 188 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 provides that an employer who proposes to dismiss one or more employees as redundant must consult representatives of any relevant trade union which he recognises for collective bargaining purposes. He must do that within prescribed time limits which depend on the number of employees to be dismissed—I think that that is familiar to the Committee.<br><br>
Where an employer has chosen to recognise a trade union for collective bargaining purposes, he is required to inform and consult the union's representatives when its members are affected by a transfer or by proposed redundancies. The key word, however, which relates to the nub of the hon. Gentleman's question is where an employer has "chosen" to recognise a trade union.<br><br>
I commend the hon. Gentleman's ingenuity in finding yet another opportunity to press the case for statutory recognition arrangements for trade unions, but he should be in no doubt about the Government's views on this subject. It is a fundamental principle of Government policy that employers should be free to decide for themselves, in the light of the circumstances and the needs of their business, whether or not to recognise a trade union.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 544</span>
Opposition members of the Committee who support the amendments may have emphasised that the "deemed recognition" contained within them would not have to be recognition for any purpose other than the information and consultation provisions of the transfer regulations or the statutory redundancy consultation provisions. I understand that. However, the hon. Gentleman's aims are irreconcilable with a fundamental principle of the present law on transfers and redundancy consultation. That principle is that the requirement to inform and consult a trade union should arise only as a consequence of an employer's choice to recognise that union for collective bargaining.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hurt on <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister reconcile the Government's commitment to voluntarism in terms of collective bargaining—that it is up to an employer which union to recognise—with the clear wording in the acquired rights directives which makes it obligatory on member states to ensure that workers representatives are consulted on the transfer of an undertaking?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of the terms of the directive. Both directives define the employee representatives who must be informed and consulted as those
<br><blockquote><p>"provided for by the laws or practices of the member states."</p></blockquote>
In the United Kingdom, this means representatives of recognised trade unions—that is, unions which an employer has chosen to recognise for collective bargaining, not ones which he has been deemed to have recognised for the purposes of the directive.<br><br>
The amendments are, therefore, unacceptable in principle, but even were that not the case it is hard to see how the proposed mechanism could possibly work in practice. Any employer planning a transfer, or the making of redundancies, who did not recognise a trade union for collective bargaining purposes, would presumably have to call the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service in to adjudicate as to whether one or more unions should be deemed to have been recognised. I very much doubt whether ACAS would enjoy having to decide whether a union's representatives were "suitable" for such a purpose. I cannot imagine what criteria ACAS would be required to employ in judging suitablilty.<br><br>
The amendments envisage that ACAS might suggest for some unspecified reason, that a ballot should be held. Such a ballot would have to take place under rules approved by the certification officer, but the amendment does not answer any of the questions that clearly arise. Whose ballot would it be, and who would supervise it? Who would pay for it? What would the constituency be? There are a great many other questions.<br><br>
The overridding problem, however, is that the involvement of ACAS and any necessary ballot would need to be arranged and take place long enough before a transfer to allow the provision of information and adequate time for consultation. Has the hon. Gentleman really thought about how this would work in practice? Do Opposition Members really beleive that it would make sense for the law to require a full-scale ACAS investigation, and possibly a ballot of the entire work force, in a case where an employer was proposing to make a single employee redundant? Do they believe that ACAS,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0652">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 545</span>
having found the statutory recognition procedures "unworkable" in the late 1970s, would welcome having to determine, in the absence of any given criteria, whether or not a union should be deemed to be recognised at a particular workplace?<br><br>
I must say that I find it astonishing that the hon. Gentleman, who is normally so radical and progressive is so eager to turn the clock back by involving a third party in what should be a matter entirely for employees. I assume that he has forgotten what happened between 1976 and 1979, when his party tried to force unwilling employees to recognise trade unions. Has he forgotten that the mechanism employed at that time, which also involved ACAS, was abandoned as being disruptive and, in ACAS' own words, unworkable?<br><br>
It is clear to the Government that the result of the amendment could only be to make transfers of undertakings more difficult, with obvious implications for business efficiency and employment prospects, and to make it virtually impossible for employers to make employees redundant in accordance with the statutory consultation requirements. The amendments are unacceptable in principle and unworkable in practice. I strongly recommend the Committee to resist them, should the hon. Gentleman decide to press them to a vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think we can fairly term that a scolding for me from the Minister. However, he did not deal with the crux of the problem. He made his usual whine about how it will be bad for employers, who will be unable to make money and who will be unable to exploit individuals. Can the Minister confirm that the basis of the regulation is that employees are to be consulted? Is that not the statutory basis?<br><br>
It was probably slightly naive of the Labour Government and one of the defects when they agreed to it that they did not make clear that the overriding duty was to consult and that, if there were no laws within a country to ensure consultation, that would also be written into the directive. In those days, we were living in the best of all possible benign worlds and did not foresee the nastiness of subsequent legislation. Will the Minister confirm that, if there is no recognised trade union, employers will not have to consult workers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I went over that at some length during my earlier remarks. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) is seeking to rely on the Commission's view of what constitutes consultation, whereas the Government's position is clear. The terms of the directive allow for existing custom and practice to be taken into account in implementing the directive. There will be no requirement to consult, if an employer has not recognised trade unions. That is our interpretation of the directive. If the Labour Government had been keen to do that, they could have introduced an appropriate Bill. They did not have to rely on the Commission to draw up legislative proposals. In fact, the Labour Government did require statutory recognition. I spoke at some length about how that met an unpleasant fate and was dismissed by ACAS as unworkable. So the hon. Gentleman, like Sir Galahad, is fighting battles long since dead and irrelevant to the needs of the present labour market.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 546</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the message should go out loud and clear that the Minister is urging all British workers to join trade unions, which the Opposition welcome. Perhaps he would put that on record. If he is not saying that, the implication is extremely worrying. If he is not encouraging people to join trade unions, he is suggesting that he, as a Minister of the Crown, is prepared to see British workers put at a disadvantage, compared with their European counterparts. That is crazy.<br><br>
I look forward to hearing the Minister's response, but may I first refer him to the example that I cited in column 514 of the Committee's proceedings on 21 January 1993. If consultation is not required in this day and age of considerable cross-border trading by companies, there will be examples—there already have been—of workers in other countries who have an advantage over workers in the United Kingdom. Is the Minister saying that? If he is, logically, because of the interpretation of the directive and to give workers in the United Kingdom a level playing-field, he must follow that up by saying that workers in the United Kingdom should join trade unions because that is their only protection under the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is muddled. The issue is not about membership but about recognition of trade unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh, come on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman if he wishes to make a point. He says, "Oh, come on" from a sedentary position, but this is a fundamental issue. Whether people are members of a trade union is irrelevant for the purpose of the regulations. What matters is whether the employer has recognised a trade union.<br><br>
11.15 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To pursue my point further, is the Minister saying that in order to give workers in the United Kingdom a level playing-field he would recommend to employers, in the light of the current regulations and the directive, that they should recognise trade unions? If he is not saying that, he is disadvantaging British workers in cases of cross-border takeovers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has changed his standpoint.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is the same point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, it is not the same point at all. The hon. Gentleman began by saying that I was calling on everyone to join trade unions and by asking whether I would like to put that on record. He could equally have argued that I was calling on employers not to recognise trade unions. What he said about calling on people to join trade unions is a complete red herring. The membership of trade unions is irrelevant for the purpose of the regulations. What matters is whether an employer chooses to recognise a trade union.<br><br>
If he chooses to recognise a trade union, the consultation requirement will apply. The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) said that British workers would be disadvantaged, compared to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0653">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 547</span>
their European competitors. I do not see any great disadvantage to British workers if the "advantage" is to add to the burden on employers, to the extent that British workers find themselves on the dole. The sooner that Opposition Members realise that the costs of implementing some of the Commission's measures are paid for in jobs, the better it will be for the interests of workers at a time of high unemployment.<br><br>
It is right for the Government to consider the terms of directives and to implement them in a way which represents custom and practice in this country. One of the reasons why a higher proportion of our work force is in employment than that of almost all our European partners is because we do not go in for some of the expensive nonsense which adds to the cost of employment and limits opportunities in the labour market.<br><br>
The argument of the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston is no more than a reflection of old-fashioned Labour party opinion, which tries to give to the trade unions a monopoly in the labour market which they need, if they are to advance their interests through increasing membership.<br><br>
It is not for me to create statutory advantages, or statutory disadvantages, for trade unions. Our business is to ensure that the labour market operates as effectively as possible in the interests of wealth creation and employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a fair summary of what the Minister said that he is creating incentives for employers not to recognise trade unions by excluding the right to statutory consultation in workplaces that have not recognised trade unions, thus making it easier for employers to shed labour at will in such workplaces?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is entirely for an employer to decide what measures he takes to consult the work force. If he recognises a trade union, he is under particular statutory requirements. Progressive employers, faced with redundancies, will inform and consult the work force.<br><br>
If the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) is asking whether the effect of the directive is to disadvantage trade unions, she must address that question to her colleagues who signed up to the directive in the first place when they were in Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When he responded to my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, the Minister tried to suggest that there were conflicts in his comments, but I am not sure that that is so. He is effectively encouraging people who want their statutory right to consulation to join trade unions and demand recognition. That is the only way in which they will obtain their rights under the Minister's proposal. Is that what the Minister is encouraging people to do?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is simply implementing the directive as he is required to do, following the threat of infraction proceedings by the European Commission. The Opposition want to amend the law in a way that would require employers to recognise trade unions or that would have the effect of there being deemed recognition of trade unions. That would be the effect of the amendments, as I explained at length. I have also explained that our position is that it is for employers to choose whether to recognise
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 548</span>
trade unions and that it would not be appropriate for us to place a statutory requirement on them to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That point that must be considered is not the red herring of recognition, but whether British workers per se should have the right to be consulted and, if so, what mechanisms the Government are prepared to put in place to ensure that that takes place. He said that progressive employers will be doing that. I make my case by referring again to the example of the Netherlands where there is a much lower percentage of trade union membership but a statutory requirement to consult. Is that not a better mechanism? Are the Government not prepared to ensure that British workers are consulted on takeovers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some members of the Committee may not be well briefed on the details of the argument between those who believe that the terms of the directive mean one thing and the Government who believe that they mean another. Perhaps I may help the hon. Gentleman by spelling them out.<br><br>
The Opposition appear to be arguing that the directive imposes an absolute requirement for employee representatives. The Government believe that that is not the position. The matter is the subject of a disagreement with the European Commission, but we are confident that the European Court of Justice will agree with our interpretation. The directive defines the employee representatives who must be consulted as those
<br><blockquote><p>"provided for by the laws or practice of the Member States".</p></blockquote>
In the United Kingdom, that means representatives of recognised trade unions. The law reflects that interpretion of the directive—that is, the Government's interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made the point that the overriding statutory right is the right for all workers in all companies, apart from small ones, to be consulted. The Minister is correct. The basis of conflict with the European Commission is that this country is not fulfilling that obligation.<br><br>
The Minister believes that the Government will win their case in the European Court of Justice. It would be one of the few times that we have won a case in the European Court of Justice. Our record is very bad. My interpretation of the Minister's argument is that recognition must be in accordance with the rights and practices in a country, the assumption in the directive being that there are rights and practices. The Minister said that we have no rights and practices, so we do not have to consult. I believe that the European Court will find against the Government because the overriding duty is statutory consultation. Even if there are no rights and practices, there must be consultation. The Government will lose. Therefore we shall have to consider methods of ensuring consultation, instead of dodging round it by talking about a recognised trade union. I fear that there will be a long drawn out court case, which will once again prove that the Government are wrong in this area of legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke earlier about resisting expensive nonsense, which cast my mind back to the appearance of the Attorney-General before the Committee last Thursday when we heard much expensive nonsense from the right hon. and learned Gentleman.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0654">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 549</span>
The amendment is important and the debate has been significant. What has been presented to the Committee is the essence of the Government's argument in their current dispute with the European Commission about the proper interpretation of the meaning of article 2 of the acquired rights directive. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden was accurate and reflective. The British Government have not yet won an argument put before the European Court of Justice under the provisions of the treaty of Rome. My hon. Friend rightly said that the essence of the Government's argument is slightly implausible. Like other arguments that they have presented before the European Court of Justice, their argument about this matter is unlikely to be successful.<br><br>
The Opposition are trying, as we have done on other occasions, to bring British law not only into line with the letter of the acquired rights directive but into harmony with the spirit of that directive. It is worth pointing out that, as my hon. Friend made clear, article 2 does impose an obligation on member states of the Community to ensure consultation with representatives of the work force.<br><br>
It is implausible and incredulous—therefore, I suspect, entirely in character—for the Government to take the position that because British law does not require an obligation to recognise trade unions, there is no legal obligation to consult workers' representatives. That strikes at the fundamental heart of the acquired rights directive. It is difficult to understand how the Government's argument before the European Court could be successful if they say that, because there is no established law requiring consultation with unions or requiring recognition of unions, we are not required under our treaty obligations to consult workers' representatives. The treaty and the directive make it clear that there should be consultation with workers.<br><br>
It is difficult to understand how the argument about domestic law could successfully be used as a justification for not complying with the terms of the acquired rights directive. The argument goes round and round; we are chasing our tail and trying to bite it. There is no legal sense in it because of the overreaching effect of European Community law. It is a peculiar argument to say that British law is different and should take precedence over the terms of the directive.<br><br>
We have had an interesting debate and have heard interesting comments from the Minister about not imposing heavy costs and burdens on British employers. Many Opposition Members agree with that—none of us want British jobs to be lost because of the imposition of costs and burdens. We have to consider that argument in detail, however. We are talking about the need to consult workers' representatives. I do not understand how that would impose substantial costs or burdens on British employers. I am sure that the Minister agrees that that is, after all, what employers should be doing, especially when the livelihoods of workers might be affected adversely by the consequences of the transfer of an undertaking.<br><br>
What specific, onerous and objectionable burden would be placed on British employers by requiring them simply to consult their employees about the consequences of the transfer of the business? That should be common ground between both sides of the Committee. This is not about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 550</span>
imposing onerous burdens but about promoting sensible industrial relations. That is probably why it does not have the support of Conservative Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman give the Committee the benefit of his advice on how much time it would take to go through the procedures involving ACAS which are proposed in the amendment? Does he still believe that that would not add to the costs or burdens placed on business? If a business were losing considerable sums of money and had to go through that lengthy procedure, is he arguing that that would not be a cost on that business?<br><br>
11.30 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My understanding of the amendment is that it would be the responsibility of ACAS to conduct a ballot. The proposed balloting arrangements would not impose, therefore, a direct cost on employers. Some administrative obligations may be placed on employers, because information will need to be provided to ACAS about who is entitled to be balloted, and so on.<br><br>
However, as the Minister has raised the question of ACAS ballots, it might be worth pointing out that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the notion of an ACAS-conducted ballot. The Minister earlier drew attention to the record of ACAS under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, when it tried to conduct ballots in the late 1970s. In particular, he drew attention to the difficulties experienced by ACAS in conducting a proper ballot during the so-called Grunwick dispute, which grabbed a lot of headlines and coverage.<br><br>
If we look at the record and form a proper, balanced view of events at that time, there is no reason to assume that ACAS is unsuitable to conduct a ballot in the 1990s, if we get the legislation right. That is the Government's responsibility.<br><br>
In the 1970s, the balloting arrangements provided for by the 1978 Act were rendered effectively inoperable by fairly hostile interpretations in the Court of Appeal, which made it impossible for ACAS to conduct a ballot in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements. That was recognised at the time by ACAS. That is why, in 1979, it asked the Government to review balloting arrangements.</span></p>
<p>[SIR MICHAEL NEUBERT <i>in the Chair]</i></p>
<p>My understanding is that ACAS was not against any kind of balloting at all taking place on such issues but that it was simply reporting—and rightly so—to the Government that, as a result of interpretations by the Court of Appeal, the ACAS balloting requirements, obligations and duties were effectively unenforceable.</p>
<p>That admission does not prove that we cannot get it right but that at that time we got it wrong. The legislation was drafted by the then Labour Government. Opposition Members must open their hearts and say, "We got it wrong on that occasion". That is not an argument against trying to get it right on a subsequent occasion.</p>
<p>The Government do not have a substantive technical argument against the amendment. It is an ideological argument. As soon as we reach the rich vein of ideology that prevails in our discussions, we start to bang our heads
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0655">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 551</span>
against a brick wall. The argument between both sides of the Committee is based not on a technicality but on a substantive divergence of opinion about the right way to conduct industrial relations in this particular area.</p>
<p>Opposition members of the Committee are unimpressed by the Government's case about costs. It is a familiar fig leaf that the Government tend to trot out on these occasions. It is convenient for the Government to do this. They want to blank out further substantive discussion on the merits of our proposals. None of us wants substantive costs to be imposed on industry, but Opposition members of the Committee want workers to have an improved right to be consulted on these matters. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with or unreasonable about the notion of working people being consulted when the businesses where they are employed are being sold over their heads. That is the substantive point in our amendment.</p>
<p>I draw the Committee's attention also to the fact that, in our earlier proceedings, the Government trumpeted the value of ballots in other contexts. For example, we notice the creeping practice of balloting on industrial action and trade union elections. Such ballots are supported by both sides of the Committee.</p>
<p>When it comes to issues concerning, for example, the recognition of trade unions in the context of the right of employees to be consulted when businesses have been transferred, why are ballots suddenly inappropriate in order to determine who should be the workers' representative for the purposes of the acquired rights directive?</p>
<p>It is inconsistent for the Government to trumpet the value of ballots in other areas of industrial relations but to say that ballots are completely inappropriate when it comes to the acquired rights directive. That argument contains an element of hypocrisy. I do not accuse Ministers of hypocrisy because I am fully aware, Sir Michael, that that would be out of order, but the Government's argument is hypocritical. The Government say that they like ballots in certain areas but not in others. That leads me to think that the Government's proposals to amend the 1981 TUPE regulations are in some respects welcome. In other respects, however, we are seeing the enactment of what might best be described as a cowboy's charter. The Government want British law to be brought into line with the terms of the acquired rights directive in some areas, particularly in relation to the definition of commercial ventures, but I still believe that in other areas we are dragging our feet.</p>
<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has already made clear, we shall have to discuss the matter again because the Government's argument is incomprehensible and will be incomprehensible to the European Court of Justice. As I have said, the Government have yet to win any substantive argument about the compatibility of British law and the terms of the European directive. Although the amendment may be technically deficient—I am sure that the Government are able to present some compelling arguments on that score—we should concentrate on the substantive issue of consultation, which is an important principle in industrial relations, and on bringing British law into conformity with the terms of the directive.</p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 552</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many hon. Members on both sides of the House are worried about the encouragement of what are known as SMEs, small and medium enterprises. I should like to ask the Minister whether his point about costs would have an even more marked effect on SMEs than on larger companies, which might be better able to accept any extra costs that might arise from the amendments. The encouragement of small businesses is important. In my consituency, small businesses in the car and car components industry supply the big manufacturers. One hopes that, in his Budget, the Chancellor will do more to encourage SMEs. Any amendment that would increase costs and make our SMEs less competitive with those in Europe would be a cause for concern. I should appreciate the Minister's reassurance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give my hon. Friend the reassurance that he seeks. It was significant that I intervened during the speech of the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness, who did not address the question of costs. One of the difficulties is that Opposition Members know a great deal about trade unions but sometimes seem to show a blind spot for the ways in which businesses operate. No business makes people redundant unless it is in financial difficulty. The longer the process of addressing that difficulty continues, the greater the costs to those businesses and the more the jobs that are put at risk. The proposed convoluted, difficult procedure involving ACAS would increase the time taken to deal with such matters. That would add to the cost. My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Mills) was right to draw attention to the particular hardship that would fall upon small and medium-sized businesses, which might not recognise trade unions. It was interesting to note that throughout his speech the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness offered a fascinating insight into his attitude to the work force and to representation. When he talked about consulting the work force, what he actually meant was consulting trade union leaders.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has inadvertently misconstrued what I said. I want employers to consult the employees' representatives. That is the point that I was trying to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we can rely on the support of the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness in voting against the amendments, should his hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden press them to a vote. The amendments do not allow for consultation with representatives of the work force; they would ensure that, in every case, consultation takes place with the trade unions. Not only does the hon. Gentleman confuse the workers with the trade unions but he confuses representatives of the workers with the trade unions. He is arguing for the trade union movement but dressing it up so that he appears to be arguing for the interests of the work force.<br><br>
Our view differs from that of the Commission. The Commission does not accept the Government's view and it has referred the matter to the European Court of Justice as part of its current infraction proceedings. The Opposition are putting the case for the Commission. The case put to the Committee by the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness was that we might as well give in now because
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0656">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 553</span>
we will not win the case at the European Court of Justice and we have had a bad track record on such matters. That is not an appropriate argument for the House. The Government will continue to argue for the interests of the work force and the economic interests of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the Minister has not accurately reflected my argument. My point was that the Commission's argument is almost certainly correct. The Government will lose and they deserve to lose. Will the Minister confirm that the Government have yet to win any argument before the European Court of Justice on the terms of this, or any other, directive relating to employment matters?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are progressively winning the argument in Europe against the idea that so-called social affairs legislation is in the interests of the work force. The reason why 16.5 million people in Europe are unemployed is that so many people in the political community, especially on the left, think that workers can be given rights by passing legislation. Workers can be given benefits only by ensuring that wealth is created to pay for them. The sooner that argument is effectively made, the better for the competitiveness of Europe and for jobs. We have been round this course several times now, and I hope that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Every time I hear the Minister talking about employees' rights I am certain that, if he had been around, he would have opposed the repeal of the slavery laws, on the basis that repeal would put a burden on employers and would not be good for small and medium-sized enterprises.<br><br>
The purpose of the amemdment was not to deal with technicalities, but to put the case that current Government regulations do not fulfil our obligations under the directive. Employees do not have the statutory right to be consulted. That is why we expect the Government to lose the case at the European Court of Justice. However, because the argument is about consultation with workers, not about technicalities, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></span></p>
<p>[MR. DAVID KNOX <i>in the Chair]</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 162, in page 42, line 4, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) In Regulation 3(1) (definition of relevant transfer) after the words 'these regulations apply to', there shall be inserted—
<ol>
<li>a transfer from one person to another; or</li>
<li>a transaction involving the sale of shares leading to a change in the ownership of the undertaking; or</li>
<li>a transaction leading to the merger of the undertaking with another undertaking.</li></ol>
where the undertaking or part of the undertaking was situated in the United Kingdom immediately before the transfer or other transaction.'.".</p></blockquote>
The history of the implementation of the regulations is that the Government have always done as little as they believed they could get away with. That is the Government's philosophy and we fear that they may be doing it again.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 554</span>
We are trying to write into the regulations sufficient conditions to prevent further long drawn out processes in court. The Minister is always talking about employers' rights, but, employees have rights and there is nothing more terrible than being sacked or being made redundant and then dragging a case through the court for year after year while awaiting an outcome.<br><br>
We believe that much of this can be prevented by the Government making more explicit in the legislation the necessary conditions that must be fulfilled. The regulations state that the acquired rights directive should apply also to a transfer from one person to another, or to a transaction involving the sale of shares leading to a change in ownership of an undertaking, or to a transaction leading to the merger of one undertaking with another. I also recognise that this may be unnecessary in certain takeovers because of the transfer of terms and conditions under company law. I should be grateful for the Minister's clarification.<br><br>
We want to ensure that the regulations clarify the position as much as possible, to prevent the unnecessary delay that arises year after year when clarification is sought from the courts.<br><br>
11.45 am</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seeks to widen the scope of the regulations beyond even the ambitions of the European Commission—a formidable proposition. I am not clear what he is worried about. If the ownership of a company changes by virtue of a share transfer, the employees' terms and conditions of employment remain the same. A share takeover may have an impact on the employees of a company. The new controlling shareholder may not be content with the size or nature of the work force. He may want to change the terms and conditions of employment, but that would be no different from the ownership remaining the same but wanting a change. Employees will have the same legal protection, irrespective of whether a share takover has taken place. Any employee who has unfavourable changes in his terms and conditions of employment forced upon him may resign and claim constructive dismissal. If he is dismissed, he may go to an industrial tribunal and claim unfair dismissal or redundancy payment if appropriate.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's amendment is unnecessary and undesirable because it would unduly widen the scope of the regulations. I hope that he will agree to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister recognises that European directives specify only minimum standards and that there is no reason why Governments cannot extend them. Benign Governments interested in the welfare of their people would not simply accept minimum standards but would make it a matter of pride to extend them. There is nothing wrong with trying to improve on EC directives. However, I accept some of the Minister's argument; and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 163, in page 42, line 10, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) In Regulation 6 there shall be inserted—
<br><blockquote><p>'(c) that agreement shall continue in operation for one year following the transfer unless it is terminated or rescinded with the agreement of the trade union.'</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0657">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 555</span>
<br><blockquote><p>(3B) in Regulation 9(2)(b) there shall be inserted at the end of the sentence—
<br><blockquote><p>'save that no such variation or recission shall take place within one year of the transfer without the agreement of the trade union'.".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
I shall not be seeking leave to withdraw this amendment, unless the Minister makes a substantial concession. It is particularly important, and it relates to implementation of the EC directive. Under article 3(2) of the directive a transferee must observe any collective agreement with a trade union. Member states may impose a time limit on that, but it must not be less than one year. Again, the Government could extend that period to five years, to 10 years, or indefinitely—if they had a fit of consideration for others. The directive lays down only the minimum standard of not less than one year. Unfortunately, there is no provision for that in the regulations, so the trade union, the undertaking and the collective agreements could be de-recognised immediately. Can the Minister confirm that? Regulation 9 makes it clear that collective agreements must be carried over but that trade union recognition can be varied or rescinded immediately.<br><br>
The Government will run into difficulties with the European Court of Justice on this issue. I presume that the Government's argument is that our laws on trade union recognition are different. I am not sure whether that will wash. There is no use having an agreement which is maintained only until the ink is dry on the contract, or if there comes a day when everything changes and it is devalued. Why are not all the parts of the directive included in the clause? Is our interpretation correct?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The European Commission has been helpful on this issue—it agreed with the Government. Initially, it took the view that the regulations failed to implement the directive properly because, given the status of collective agreements in United Kingdom law, the new employer was generally free to ignore, or to vary at will, the terms of any collective agreement between a trade union and the former employer. That is what the hon. Gentleman was grumbling about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was making a point, not grumbling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All right, the hon. Gentleman drew the issue to the Committee's attention.<br><br>
The Commission eventually accepted the Government's argument that the purpose of the directive is to preserve employees' rights in a transfer, not to increase them. Hence if a collective agreement could not be legally enforced against a former employer, there was no justification for making it legally enforceable against a new employer.<br><br>
The social partners—a phrase which I know will give the hon. Gentleman a warm feeling—in the United Kingdom do not generally wish collective agreements to have legally binding effects. The directive would be a deterrent to transfers if obligations to which competitors would not be subject were placed on new employers after transfer.<br><br>
These arguments were deployed and persuaded the Commission to drop the point which the hon. Gentleman inferred from the infraction proceedings which were brought against us.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 556</span>
I hope that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will feel able to withdraw his amendment. Not even the European Commission wishes to press this issue in respect of the directive. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that by no stretch of the imagination could it be argued that it had taken an illiberal view of the implementation of the directive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The European Commission is not always right. There is no reason for us to accept the minimum standards in the directives. We think that collective agreements—whether legally enforceable beforehand or not—are important. We are concerned about good relations between employers and employees and their rights during transfers. It is not a question of whether an agreement is legally binding beforehand or afterwards. Good relations during a transfer of agreements are what matter. I shall therefore press the amendment to a vote.<br><br>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 177, in page 42, leave out lines 11 to 17 and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>(4) Regulation 7 shall be omitted and the subsequent Regulations numbered accordingly.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 179, in page 42, leave out lines 11 to 17.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to rights concerning pension schemes under a transfer of undertakings. I understand that the regulations exclude those except as laid down categories in the clause. We are trying not to clarify the law but to extend it, to ensure that rights to pension schemes are included.<br><br>
Of all the rights that an individual has at work, the most important and most dearly held is the right to a pension and the benefits that have accrued from it. That is not just because people have paid for those pension rights over many years of regular deductions from their salaries, but because paying towards a pension develops a feeling of security and comfort for later in life when they hope to enjoy the fruits of their labour.<br><br>
Many of us on both sides of the Committee will be aware of the difficulties experienced by those living on only a state pension. The conditions are not ideal, although those people can eke out a subsistence. There is no question but that a state pension is greatly enhanced
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0658">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 557</span>
by other rights obtained through various schemes with employers and organisations. We believe that pensions and pension rights are one of the most fundamental parts of our society and serve to maintain its progressive and civilized nature. That is why we attach great significance to the transfer of rights. We realise that over the years there have been abuses of and problems with pension funds and pension rights, but they are still one of the greatest contributions to people's old age.<br><br>
We are concerned about the transfer of an undertaking, not within the categories covered by the regulations, in which many individuals could lose their rights. Those people, who were previously content and looking forward to an old age which would be lived in some comfort, would no longer be able to do that. For that reason, we want the regulations to be extended, and that is the basis of the amendment.<br><br>
12 noon</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The issue of occupational pensions needs to be looked at in the round to include matters that are happening elsewhere in the House and the current responsibilities of Professor Goode's inquiry into occupational pensions. In the context of this clause, we need to examine three aspects of pensions: the benefits of pension schemes; the debates about the ownership of pension schemes, including the ownership of surpluses; and the democracy of pension funds, including the continuing role of trustees after takeovers.<br><br>
Hon. Members will be aware that I have been promoting a private Member's Bill relating to those aspects. I have had detailed correspondence with other Ministers who are responsible for occupational pensions, with a view to clarifying the Government's position.<br><br>
My Bill dealt specifically with provision for pension funds in the event of a takeover, but because it was known that the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill was proceeding through the House, it was felt by experts that it was inappropriate to incorporate clauses relating to regulation 7, although it was recognised that regulation 7 is of material importance in this particular area.<br><br>
After Siemens took over part of Plessey, on the break-up of that company, unilateral changes were imposed by Siemens on the way that the trustees structure operated. I do not think that the Government want companies to operate in a way that clearly disadvantages the employee. Had regulation 7 not existed, there would have been a degree more protection for pension fund members, in the context of the way in which the scheme was managed and the internal democracy of the fund. The option for the incoming company to seek materially to alter the structure of the trustee body would not have been there.<br><br>
Such cases arise. To those Conservative members of the Committee who apparently oppose developments in Europe, it is interesting to note that, once again, we have a situation where companies operating in the United Kingdom, whose parentage is based elsewhere in Europe, apply standards that they would not get away with in their own country, either because of existing federal legislation or because of local interpretation of the directive.<br><br>
The inclusion of regulation 7 is a material disadvantage if we wish to maintain existing structures that result in the democratic election and appointment of trustees.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 558</span>
The issue of the ownership of pension funds is complex and much of it is covered by Professor Goode's remit. Perhaps it would not be proper to dwell too much on his remit. The debate is made more complex, and Professor Goode's ability to regulate on this matter—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of clarity, this has nothing to do with the funds themselves but with the pension rights of workers. It does not impinge upon pension funds, which is a matter for other legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree. The Minister is perfectly correct. It is one of the areas where because pensions are referred to specifically, the structure of British legislation becomes over complicated. That, in my opinion, has provided a loophole through which several companies have slipped. The Minister's observation about which area the regulations cover was correct. The amendments are important in the context of subsequent legislation as a result of the Goode inquiry. I want an assurance from the Minister that he stands by the advice given to me by his hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, who wrote to me on 10 December thanking me for a letter that I sent to her on 9 December and reaffirming her support for the general intention of my Bill, which is to add to the protection currently offered to members of occupational pension schemes. I am pleased to see that the Minister is nodding. I suspect that Professor Goode's recommendations may refer to the perceived disadvantage—the Minister may disagree with me about whether that disadvantage is actual—caused by regulation 7, which could be removed by the removal of the regulation. The Bill may receive its Third Reading prior to any formal debate on Professor Goode's activities. Should Professor Goode's recommendations require the amendment or removal of regulation 7, can the Minister assure me, in the light of the letter from the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, that the Government will honour that obligation and come back with a further amendment to ensure that that takes place?<br><br>
The question of how the schemes are managed in the context of takeovers is interminably complex. This regulation makes the issue that much harder, because it adds another legal dimension to an already complex situation. Against that background, I believe that it would be proper to agree the amendments. It would make subsequent regulation and legislation easier. In the absence of Government support, I should like to have the Minister's assurance on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to understand the logic behind the Government's insistence that pensions should be excluded from the provisions of the regulations. There seem to be two arguments. The first is that European legislation does not include pensions, although that has not worried the Government in the past when they have wanted to get out of implementing provisions included by Europe. What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Just because Europe does not insist upon pensions being protected, there is no reason why we should not do so, if we think it appropriate.<br><br>
The other argument is the one that is always put forward against such regulations: cost. I fail to understand why the Government appear to think that it is less important to protect people's pension rights than it is to protect other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0659">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 559</span>
conditions of employment. Given the events of the past year, surely we can understand the importance of protecting pension rights. Pensions are not secondary. They are deferred pay. They are the money and income of real employees, stored for the future. We are framing legislation to protect employees in the event of a transfer. To say that pensions are less important seems quite wrong.<br><br>
When the employment situation changes, important changes often occur to pension rights and pension schemes. Before I became a Member of Parliament, I was involved in negotiations with a company where changes completely unrelated to pension rights were used fundamentally to change the pension scheme. When the dust had settled and the changes had been implemented, the employees examined their pension scheme and suddenly found that their ability to influence it, through member trustees who were appointed by a democratic process, had disappeared. Pensions had nothing to do with the changes that were taking place but the changes were used as a pretext to play around with the pension scheme.<br><br>
A more recent example, which persists to this day, concerns the privatisation of the management services division of the West Midlands regional health authority. The new company—Qa Business Services—was not successful and went bust within 18 months. Before privatisation, the employees were assured that their pension rights, which had been built up over years in the NHS superannuation scheme, would be safe.<br><br>
Now, 150 of those employees have been told that they could lose up to two thirds of their pension entitlement because the pension fund that was set up cannot cover its liabilities.<br><br>
That is the reality: real people could, and will, lose their pension rights. I do not want to detain the Committee unnecessarily, but it is important for the Government to explain why they are resisting the amendment and want to exclude all reference to pension rights. Is it simply that pensions are not included in European legislation and that, therefore, there is no point in including them in our legislation? Is it cost issue? Or is the protection of the deferred pay of employees less important and less relevant than the protection of other working conditions? If the Government believe that, and intend to exclude the provisions, what will they say to the pensioners of organisations such as Qa Business Services who, in years to come, will suffer a blow to their standard of living in their old age because of Government policy? It was as a result of Government policy that that division of the regional health authority was privatised. It will also be the result of Government policy if their pensions are not protected because they are excluded from the regulations. Ministers have some explaining to do and I hope that they will do so today.<br><br>
12.15 pm</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Members for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, for Ellesmere Port and Neston and for Northfield on having made their speeches on the importance of pension rights without mentioning Mr. Robert Maxwell. That must have been a considerable effort. We heard about the West Midlands regional health authority and the importance of such matters, but the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 560</span>
hon. Members neglected to mention perhaps the most dramatic example, which would not have been affected by regulation 7, because it covers not pension funds but pension rights.<br><br>
The effect of the amendment would be that when a transfer of an undertaking took place, the new employer would be required by law to take over and continue whatever occupational pension arrangements the previous employer had put in place. That might create a powerful disincentive for anyone to take over the undertaking. It would be small consolation for the work force to be told that as a result of the abolition of regulation 7 they were out of work and not able to continue in the enterprise but that, had they been taken over and had it not been so expensive, their previous pension rights would have been retained. Again, the Opposition's enthusiasm for regulation is out of touch with economic realities and the need to maintain employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree with the director of a large company who said to me in the context of the takeover of another company that if the trustees of the first scheme had not been imprudent and left such a large surplus, the company would not have gone for the takeover? Is that what the Minister is saying?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I am saying that the hon. Gentleman is talking about something which has nothing to do with the amendment or the clause. He is talking about pension funds. The clause covers workers' pension rights. If regulation 7 were removed and a company were taken over, the new employer would be obliged to provide provisions for occupational pensions. It has nothing to do with the fund; it covers the rights and entitlements of the workers in respect of their pensions.<br><br>
The matter raised by the hon. Gentleman is serious and I have considerable sympathy for some of his views, but that is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security. The amendment would create rigidity in terms of the benefits and rights of workers on transfer, which could inhibit transfer and therefore be to the disadvantage of people in employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am perplexed about what the Minister is saying. Pension rights with the first employer will have been set up by reference to the creation of a pension fund and a scheme to go with that pension fund. In other words, those pension rights are acceptable under the pension scheme. If the Minister is saying that the fund is sacrosanct, why is it that rights that employees have accrued and that can be paid out of the fund cannot be protected? Why should there suddenly be a right unilaterally to change those rights?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on to a separate point. One could envisage circumstances—the example to which hon. Members find it difficult to allude is a case in point—in which employees were in a pension fund that was in difficulties and unable to meet the requirements of the work force. The company may be in difficulties. If regulation 7 were deleted, the effect of that, and the amendment, would be that any employer taking over the enterprise would be obliged to provide the same terms and conditions, regardless of the pension fund which did or did not exist at the time. That is too onerous a burden, which could result in employees being disadvantaged.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0660">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 561</span>
There is no consolation in telling someone that they are unemployed but that, had they been employed, they would have had the same pension entitlements as existed previously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why should a pension fund be in a different position after the transfer? If it could meet its obligations before, why not after?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman takes a specific case, but his colleagues are proposing an amendment which would apply in every circumstance. The effect of the amendment would be, whatever the circumstances that may arise and whatever the position of any pension fund that may exist, that anyone taking over the enterprise would be obliged to provide the same terms and conditions. That is unrealistic.<br><br>
Amendment No. 179 is less drastic but unacceptable, none the less. It would remove subsection (4) from the Bill which fulfills a commitment given in the citizen's charter White Paper to remove the possibility of "technical" redundancy payments when civil servants transfer as the result of a privatisation.<br><br>
This is a technical adjustment. There is nothing sinister about it. It arises from the fact that the civil service superannuation scheme incorporates both pension and redundancy rights. As a civil servant's pension rights do not transfer under the regulations as they stand, there is a remote possiblity that redundancy entitlement would be considered not to transfer, either, but to crystallise. In other words, this could have the effect of giving civil servants the right to redundancy payments, even where they continue to work in the same job after a transfer. Clearly, that would be unwarranted and inequitable. In the light of that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister frequently presents quite convincing arguments in favour of his point of view. From what I have heard this morning, either he is not on best form or, as I believe, he has not got a good case. As he said, we want to ensure that if someone is transferred from one owner to another, their pension rights go with them. There is no reason why people should be at a disadvantage in those circumstances.<br><br>
We accept that our proposals would go beyond the existing regulations and the European directive. It may be that we are not familiar with pension scandals in the rest of Europe, but there is clear evidence that we need to deal with the terrible pension scandals in this country. We are not dealing with those. The clause provides an opportunity to do that.<br><br>
Hon. Members have suggested that it would be burdensome, if there had been fraud and villainy, for the new owner of a company to have to take on duties to the pensioners and pension fund payers that are the other side of the coin of their right to their pensions. We are aware of that. It would be onerous. It is intended to be onerous. We want to ensure that pensioners and those paying into pension funds have the first bite at some of the money. The problem is that they are at the bottom of the queue.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 562</span>
aiming to ensure that they get their money back. They do not, quite frankly, give a damn whether it is pensioners money or anybody else's money. The banks should have noticed that Maxwell was stealing the money, but they did not and they intend to be at the front of the queue.<br><br>
One of the reasons for the amendment is to put pensioners and the people who pay into pension funds at the front of the queue. As my hon. Friends have said, for many people, with the possible exception of their house, what they have paid into a pension fund, and their pension rights, form one of their main assets and a source of security to which they can look forward. In the British courts, which are not usually too favourably disposed towards people in receipt of wages, it has been accepted that money paid into a pension fund and pension entitlements are deferred money. Pension funds are a method of putting something by for a rainy day. For many people, one of the rainy days is when their job is sold off or passed on to another set of bosses, who may try to exploit what has happened. That creates a mad situation, with people putting money aside for a rainy day but finding, when the first rainy day occurs, that their assets or their rights have disappeared. We do not think that that is right.<br><br>
We recognise that the provision may cause technical difficulties for employers and pension funds. That may be tough, but we believe that the rights of the employees and the pensioners should come first.<br><br>
I am not afraid to mention the Maxwell scandals. I could ask the Minister what happened to the transferred pension rights of those who worked for the professional and executive register, which was formerly part of the Department of Employment, when they were passed to Robert Maxwell. Where did their rights—passed over to Robert Maxwell by a Tory Government, not a Labour Government—end up? What will happen to the pension rights of those working at former Department of Employment skill centres, who have been passed to a variety of new owners? If those new owners go broke, as several of them are doing, what will happen to the pension rights? Was protection built in? Was it special protection? If so, why should those people have special protection, if the Minister is not prepared to pass it on to others?<br><br>
We believe that there is no point in the history of pension fiddle scandals at which the funds, the pensioners and the contributors are more vulnerable than that at which money, a company or workers are being transferred. We do not mean transfers from the public to the private sector alone; we mean transfers within the private sector. It is at the point of transfer that the villains descend on the funds. We want to ensure that protection is offered to those who have rights, for which they have paid, and of which they are being deprived because the Government are not prepared to carry over their rights. That is what we are advocating.<br><br>
The Government constantly talk about the rights of individuals. This issue has nothing to do with collective rights, to which the Government object. These are the rights of honest, decent individuals who have paid against the promise that they will be looked after and given the pension for which they have paid. If the Government will not accept the amendments, or similar

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 563</span>
provisions, they will be saying, "You won't get what you paid for if you're shifted over from one company to another." We think that that is wrong. The amendments provide an opportunity for the Government to tighten the rules.<br><br>
We are not suggesting that our proposals will close what might be described as the window of opportunity for fraudsters which exists in British pension law. We believe, however, that it will close the window a little. Anything that reduces the problem would be a step forward. I do not understand why the Minister cannot accept the proposition. Is he saying that there are companies which would not take over another organistion unless they could raid the pension fund?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says no, but why not? The Minister is saying that the money in the pension fund will carry over but that the rights will not. Why should the new owners have difficulty over discharging their duties to the pensioners and those who have paid in, unless they intend to raid the fund? What else will they do with the money in the fund?<br><br>
12.30 pm</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is muddled. The effect of the amendment would be to require a new employer taking over an enterprise to provide for the same terms, conditions and benefits in a pension scheme which he would provide. Any payments made into any funds, and any rights accrued as a result of a pension which employees already had, would obviously transfer. What is at issue is the arrangements that the employer makes. There is no question of the pension fund, which had applied and which the employees had paid into, and the rights which had accrued from that fund, not operating after transfer in the same way as before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the point that we are trying to make. Let us return to a straightforward case where company A disposes of a little bit—part Z—of its operation to company B. The Z part of the operation takes with it either all or part of an existing pension fund. Unless someone has been thieving until then, part Z will be capable of delivering the benefits to which the pensioners and the payers-in are entitled. So that fund goes over to company B. In what way would it be onerous for company B to continue to discharge the obligations to the pensioners that it had taken on if it took over a fund that was capable of meeting all their entitlements?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The contributions to the fund and the benefits that would arise from those contributions would obviously continue, but the new employer may not want to make as large a contribution or to provide a pension scheme with so many benefits. The payments previously made by the employee and the employer would continue to operate. The effect of the amendment would be to oblige a new employer, on transfer, to provide as generous a pension scheme for the future as had applied in the past. It is that aspect that I am arguing would be an unnecessary restriction on transfer. That is what the hon. Gentleman proposes in the amendment. I agree with all that he has
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 564</span>
said about the protection of pensioners' rights and that would not be affected by the terms of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, it would. Employees who pay into a pension fund do so, as did pensioners who paid into a pension fund on the basis of a contract and an understanding that the arrangement that they had entered into with their then employer will continue to be fulfilled. The transfer of undertakings is being used as an opportunity by an employer to get out of the obligations which were part of the bargain that the previous employer and the pensioners had entered into. That may not constitute a breach of contract, but it does breach the understanding which established the pension fund that has been transferred.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. There is no way that the new employer can get out of the obligations and benefits that arose from the previous arrangements with the previous employer. The money from the employers' and employees' contributions will have gone into that fund and will generate particular benefits, which are protected. That is a matter for separate legislation. It may be that the hon. Gentleman has argued that the legislation ought to be improved in terms of the protection that it provides, but it would not be affected by regulation 7.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To return to the same point, when pensioner Knox, for the sake of argument, entered into an arrangement with the Forsyth-McLoughlin international corporation, his understanding was that at all times the corporation would pay in 8, 9 or 10 per cent., or whatever contributions. The corporation disposes of the fund to Wood plc, which wants to make a lower contribution than that made by the previous corporation. We say that that is wrong. That would be a lawful fiddle which we want to make unlawful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is saying in simple terms, so that the Minister can understand, that it is clear that past service benefits are protected, but someone who, as in my hon. Friend's hypothetical example, has given 30 years of service to the previous company under a contract which includes the provision of a pension fund, may have diminished pension benefits accruing from the final 10 years of his working life. The net result may be that having given 30 years to the company, he may be worse off when he retires. That cannot be right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend and raise the horrifying spectre of European concepts. I accept that our proposal goes beyond the directive. I make no bones about that. British villainy in this sphere may be more advanced than in the rest of Europe, so we may need more advanced legislation to counter it.<br><br>
As was said by the European Court, the object of the directive is to guarantee the rights of employees. Pensioners at present have rights but when there is a transfer of undertakings and ownership, their rights may be severely diminished. That is wrong and we intend to press the amendment to a Division.<br><br>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 164, in page 42, line 17, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) In Regulation 8(2)(a) after the words 'his dismissal' there shall be inserted—
<br><blockquote><p>'where the economic, technical and organisational reason would have led to the dismissal even if the transfer had not taken place'.</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4B) In Regulation 10(2) (duty to inform and consult trade union representatives) the words from 'long enough' to 'inform those representatives of shall be omitted and there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'At least 90 days before a relevant transfer is due to take place, the employer of any relevant employees must inform either:
<ul>
<li>"(i) the representatives of any independent trade union recognised by him; or</li>
<li>(ii) where there is no recognised trade union, representatives of any independent trade union with significant membership at that workplace; or</li>
<li>(iii) where there is no significant trade union membership, representatives otherwise selected by the workers of all of the following matters.".'.".</li>
</ul></p></blockquote>
The amendment refers to regulation 8, which covers dismissals arising from transfers and makes it clear that any employee who is dismissed for a reason connected with the transfer shall be considered to have been unfairly dismissed. If, however, the reason for the dismissal is economic, technical, or organisational, entailing changes in the work force, the dismissal may be deemed not to be unfair. There may be circumstances in which dismissal is reasonable. That would allow the employer to reorganise his business, to make it more attractive and to do all those things that the Minister is always telling us that employers do by means of the divine authority and rights conferred upon them. That should be contrasted with article 4 of the directive, which states that:
<br><blockquote><p>"The transfer … shall not in itself constitute grounds for dismissal".</p></blockquote>
There is some conflict between the terms of the regulations and the article, and even some confusion within the articles. There is no doubt that regulation 8 contrasts with article 4, which also provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the contract… is terminated because the transfer… involves a substantial change of working conditions to the detriment of the employee, the employer shall be regarded as having been responsible for termination of the contract of employment".</p></blockquote>
Economic, technical or organisational reasons may be used, but the words of the directive have been interpreted very differently from similar words in the regulations.<br><br>
The famous European Court of Justice, to which we have spent some time alluding, delivered some guidance on the point about economic, technical and other matters. In the case of D'Urso and ors <i>v.</i> Ercole Marelli
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 566</span>
Elettromeccanica SpA, the Advocate General, whose opinion is not legally binding but has great influence on the court, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not accept the view according to which the Directive permits any dismissal for economic organisational or technical reasons. In fact, the Directive expressly prohibits such dismissals when they are the result of the transfer of the undertaking. Only dismissals which would have been made <i>in any case"</i></p></blockquote>
—in other words, the directive can only be used for dismissals that would have been made, in any case, beforehand—
<br><blockquote><p>"for instance if the decision was taken before there was any question of transferring the undertaking falls within the exclusion."</p></blockquote>
I realise that the statement does not form part of the court's decision, but it does have persuasive authority in future cases. It is at least arguable that the regulations are defective and that nothing in the Bill remedies the defect. For that reason and to try to help the Government out of their difficulties and prevent them from being dragged through the court once again, and to avoid wasting taxpayers' money, we want to clarify the position.<br><br>
The amendment clearly states:
<br><blockquote><p>"where the economic, technical and organisational reason would have led to the dismissal even if the transfer had not take place."</p></blockquote>
That is the nub of the amendment. We propose that those words be explicitly included to prevent all the hassle that we would otherwise have to go through.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his help and advice, particularly in relation to the view of the Advocate General in the case that he mentioned to the Committee. Of course, his view is just that—the view of the Advocate General—and it is not the judgment of the court. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to rethink his position on the amendment. The effect of (4A), which relates to economic, technical and organisational reasons for dismissal, would be to prevent an employer from dismissing anyone fairly in the context of a transfer, even if there was no work for them to do—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister sure of that? Would that not fall within the category of an event having taken place irrespective of the transfer and thus be permitted by the regulations? I think that that is the opinion of the Advocate General.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government believe that an employer must already show that the transfer was not the principal reason for the dismissal in order to benefit from the economic, technical or organisational requirements of the directive. It clearly provides that, although dismissals because of a transfer are unfair, that would not stand in the way of dismissals for economic, organisational or technical reasons. I am advised that the amendment would have the perverse effect of preventing employers from making people redundant when they cannot usefully employ them. The amendment would prevent necessary reorganisation and efficiency improvements that are connected with transfers.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
If the hon. Gentleman is concerned that there is not sufficient protection, he can rest on the requirement which relates to economic, technical and organisational reasons for dismissals. It is an appropriate safety valve which also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0663">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 567</span>
recognises that there is protection for employees who are subject to a transfer. I hope, on that basis, that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about the Government's line of argument. The Minister took the view that the amendment would mean that no one could ever be dismissed. I question that. He said that even if there were no work for an employee, he could not be dismissed. Not so; and the amendment caters for that.<br><br>
As the regulations stand, I fear that it would be possible for a company to transfer a function to another company which in turn would cut an employee's wage from £5 an hour to £1.60—and claim that that was for economic reasons—life is hard in the market place, and so on. I do not know what further justification an employer would give. If the Minister says that that is not possible, although I do not think that he said that—a sleight of hand on my part—I understand his point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i><br><br>
<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask hon. Members to be brief. I was inclined to disallow a debate on this because the principles have already been elaborated, but as I have now called the debate, we shall continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was intending, Mr. Knox, to be brief as always—and, hopefully, to the point.<br><br>
I want to raise a couple of issues that have not been mentioned about the effect of the clause on women. As we know, because the labour market is so structured, many women are placed in the public sector, where they have been at the rough end of the effects of compulsory competitive tendering in larger numbers than other members of the work force. The structuring of the labour market and the discrimination in it have meant that women have tended to be in the more deregulated areas, where they are more vulnerable. They have suffered as a result of the non-extension of the transfer of undertakings regulations.<br><br>
The effect of extending the transfer of undertakings regulations should be to afford these women a little more protection. I note that the Government, who failed to implement the relevant EC directive for all this time, are now grudgingly extending it to areas of the public sector whither it was assumed that it would not be extended. We were told today that the Government are making frantic moves in Europe to withdraw the provisions altogether, under the subsidiarity rules. We welcome the extension because of the slight protection that it would offer women, who tend to be at the bottom of the labour market and who have suffered most.<br><br>
Contracting out and privatisation have widened the gender gap in pay and led to cuts in pay and entitlements. We have not really discussed that. I want to sound a warning to the effect that continued deregulation and attempts further to water down the effects of extending the directive, as clause 26 does, will hit women in the labour force disproportionately.<br><br>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
REDUNDANCY CONSULTATION PROCEDURES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 166, in page 42, line 32, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) in subsection (i) the words after 'an employee' shall be omitted and there shall be inserted the words
<br><blockquote><p>'shall consult with either:
<ol>
<li>the representatives of any independent trade union recognised by him as representing employees of that description; or,</li>
<li>where there is no recognised trade union, representatives of any independent trade union with significant membership at the workplace; or</li>
<li>where there is no significant trade union membership, representatives otherwise selected by the workers about the dismissal in accordance with this section'.".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with clause 27, which responds to the European Community's revision of the directive on collective redundancies. The purpose of that directive is to try to avoid dismissals, to reduce the number of employees dismissed and to mitigate the consequences of such dismissals, through consultation with the employer and the worker representatives.<br><br>
Clause 27 also aims to prevent a subsidiary of a transnational company from arguing that it was unable to meet its obligations under the European directive simply because the parent company was unwilling to disclose certain information.<br><br>
Finally, clause 27 brings United Kingdom law into line with the 1975 directive as it was originally drafted, ensuring that the terms of redundancy cover any collective dismissals. For example, an employer's proposal to dismiss the whole work force, and an offer to re-engage it on new terms and conditions, would be caught by the regulations.<br><br>
Opposition Members welcome the directive, which we consider an important step but one probably forced on a reluctant Minster by Europe. From the expression on the Ministers face, I judge that I am correct in that assumption. He has great problems hiding his feelings.<br><br>
There are two deficiencies, the first should not take me more than a few seconds because we have already discussed it. There is a failure in the regulation to strengthen an employer's obligation to consult recognised trade unions. It is still possible for an employer to defeat the requirement to consult by refusing to recognise a trade union. We have been round the houses in this debate before and I presume that we shall go round the block again. However, it is an important point of principle and one on which the Government are wrong—once again, it will lead to their being dragged through the European Court of Justice.<br><br>
The onus is on employers to consult. Because our law does not necessarily mean that trade unions are always recognised, that does not remove that onus or the statutory obligation to consult. We must find other methods to ensure that employers are consulted. That is the basis of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One has to admire the hon. Gentleman's presistence. We have already had this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0664">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 569</span>
argument about extending compulsory recognition of trade unions, which is what the amendment is about. I must disappoint the hon. Gentleman because I have already made clear the Government's principal opposition to the idea. We do not believe that the directive requires such an amendment, and I hope that the Committee will forgive me for not repeating the arguments and for asking the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that that might be the Ministers reply. I would call it not principled opposition but shameful opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Principled and shameful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not that a contradiction? Never mind. I fully appreciate that we have been round the houses on this issue so there is no need for me to persist with the arguments, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.<br><br>
<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 167, in page 43, line 37, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) After section 188 of the 1992 Act there shall be inserted—
<br><blockquote><p>'188A.—(1) During the period specified by section 188, if an employer has failed to consult with workers' representatives as required them a complaint may be presented to the High Court.</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) Where the Court finds a complaint under subsection (1) well founded it shall make a declaration to that effect, order the employer to disclose any information required by the union and prevent any redundancies being implemented until full consultation has taken place.'.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the second deficiency in the regulations—regulations which we welcome. The deficiency is that the protective award is left intact. The period has increased from two to four weeks on that basis, but there is no statutory obligation for the employer to consult. He may fail to consult, dismiss, pay a protective award, albeit that the two weeks has been increased to four weeks, but the dismissal will go ahead. We need a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 570</span>
procedure to require consultation so that dismissals can be considered before they take place. The protective award is an ex post facto remedy and does nothing to compel the employer to consult. We need a remedy to delay redundancy until there has been full consultation. Without such sanction and consultation rights, the supposed protection is illusory. The amendment would give workers a statutory right to be consulted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The complaints procedure and remedy which is already in place is sufficient. With the changes that the Government are making in clause 27, it fully satisfies the EC directive. The amendment is unnecessary, disproportionate and would have undesirable side effects. It would allow a trade union that did not receive all the information to which it was entitled—or possibly did not like the information that it received—to go to court to have redundancies delayed. The Government cannot accept the amendment. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was an even more perfunctory dismissal than I had expected. I shall not go through all the arguments. The Minister says that the amendment would give trade unions this right and that right. He is always talking about workers' rights and saying that he wants to secure rights and extend them, but he spends most of his time in Committee denigrating them and trying to remove them.<br><br>
Having heard the Minister's reply and having discussed the matter before, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
