	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help if I set the amendment in context and make clear how we view it. That may help the Committee's work by avoiding the need for lengthy debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to create a more comprehensive but, at the same time, greatly simplified and more easily understood system of employment protection in terms of maternity provision for women employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This part of the Bill has been rightly criticised as a lost opportunity to overhaul some of the complexities of the current arrangements governing maternity provisions and to make the provisions more generous, understandable and accessible. It is a pity that the result of the way in which the Government have worded the clauses is that very few women in Britain are likely to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the issue of pay, one in five pregnant women will remain without any right to maternity pay. It is a matter of regret that these provisions will result in virtually no
	<span class='label label-info column'>282</span>
part-time women workers experiencing any improvement. That strikes me as ironic. In the debate on unemployment that we had before the Christmas recess, the Minister of State accused the Opposition of being part-time snobs who sneer at part-time jobs. Part-time women workers will not be given a fair deal by the provisions of the Bill In that sense, the Government are failing part-time workers. That is a matter of great regret to Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain will remain at the bottom of, or very low down the list of European countries in terms of maternity pay and provisions. That is also a matter of great regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to improve the Government's implementation of the European Community maternity directive. We are dismayed at the grudging implementation of that directive, which is so evident in the Bill. Many people in other European countries and in the European Commission, and the majority of Members of the European Parliament would have liked the directive to be much stronger and far more effective. It is a pity that the Government did not take the opportunity to introduce a more satisfactory measure as a result of the directive, which was adopted during the United Kingdom's presidency of the European Community. The Government were, at the very least, grudging in their acceptance of the directive and, as I understand it, did not vote in favour of it, even after they had successfully watered it down in many places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Oddly enough, the directive was finally agreed at a meeting of the Fisheries Council. As many of us know, once a directive's groundwork has been completed it is not necessarily adopted by the relevant council. None the less, the Fisheries Council was a peculiar forum in which to decide the directive. I represented a fishing community in the European Parliament and have many dealings with fishermen in my constituency, so I know that there were, and are, no fisherwomen. Although sexless nomenclature has gained much ground, I do not think that there is such a word as "fishpersons" and that the word "fishermen" is always used. I did not come across any fishermen or, of course, any fisherwomen in North Shields who would have been affected by the maternity directive adopted in October 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another criticism of the Bill is that it would create a situation in which those trying to benefit from the new maternity provisions would have to master the details of a tremendous amount of legislation in order to understand what rights are available to them. The Opposition feel strongly about that matter, as do the many organisations that have presented evidence and expressed their views to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Equal Opportunities Commission in Northern Ireland said that in order for women to understand the benefits to which they may be entitled, or in order to ensure that they get the benefits to which they are theoretically entitled, they would have to be familiar with the provisions of and the inter-relationship between the Industrial Relations (No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 1976, the Statutory Maternity Pay (General) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1987, the Social Security (Northern Ireland) Order 1986, the EC Directive on Pregnant Workers, other domestic and European equality law and, of course, the Bill—assuming that it will be passed in this form and will affect maternity rights in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a difficult and complicated situation for people to have to deal with. The purpose of all our amendments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
relating to this part of the Bill is to introduce a comprehensive, easily understood system which would allow people to exercise the rights to which, in theory, they are entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that rights that are not easily exercised are unacceptable. Our parliamentary responsibility is to ensure that the legislation will be easy to implement so that those who ought to benefit can do so without difficulty. We seem to be facing a nightmare situation, in which many women will, in effect, be prevented from exercising their rights. I hope that the Minister will deal with the problem of the overcomplexity and the confusing nature of the different pieces of legislation that refer to maternity rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many different types of maternity pay. Some people have referred to a two-tier system, but it is more complicated than that. Many hon. Members have probably found it difficult to understand how the maternity pay provision works. We should have sympathy, therefore, for our constituents, who will have the same difficulty and who will be concerned about whether the legislation is working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another part of the process that has been brought to our attention relates to the fact that many organisations and individuals do not feel that there has been proper consultation about this aspect of the Bill. When the Minister replies, will he tell us what public consultation there has been, which interested bodies were included in that process and what amendments have been made as a result of such consultations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the Government have consulted the Equal Opportunities Commission about this aspect of the Bill. Perhaps the Minister can tell us the extent of those consultations and of consequent changes to the Government's original intentions when they first introduced this aspect of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments aim to introduce a comprehensive approach. It would have been far better, however, if the Government had come up with a single measure which dealt with all aspects of pregnant workers' rights. I hope that the Government take that point seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The uncertainty created by the clause could give rise to costly litigation. The encouragement that the Bill might give to vexatious litigants is a theme that ran through our earlier discussions. I am not sure whether, through the citizens charter initiative, the Government are trying to introduce a litigants charter. This clause, and others, seems to justify that suspicion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are doing the bare minimum required by the European directive. We have introduced our amendment because we believe that we ought to build on the directive's minimum requirement, so as to ensure that in Britain we have the best, not the worst maternity provision in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's failure to implement reasonably the directive does little for the much-vaunted Opportunity 2000 initiative and makes little of the statement by the Secretary of State for Employment concerning the need to achieve a better deal for women at work in the labour market. We are dissatisfied with the provisions of the clause. I am sure that my hon. Friends will emphasise that dissatisfaction during our discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To turn specifically to amendment No. 96, we believe that it introduces an important provision which, despite
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
being ignored by the Government, is nevertheless part of the European directive and, therefore, should be fully evident in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to the need for women to be allowed time off for antenatal care and to attend related classes, including relaxation classes. In response, the Government may say that that possibility already exists in current legislation. To a certain extent, that is true. However, it is the contention of Opposition Members, and many organisations concerned with the rights of pregnant women, that the present legal provisions do not go far enough and that they can be, and are, ignored by many employers in workplaces up and down the country. It is important to strengthen those provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present provisions state that the right to attend antenatal classes should not be withheld unreasonably. We would like those provisions to include a clear right to antenatal care and services. I believe that that was the Government's original intention in 1980, when they first considered the requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many examples of the system not working—of women being unaware of their rights, or unwilling to take the matter up with their employers through fear of reprisal. Although it is possible for some women who believe that their rights have been ignored to go to a tribunal and try to claim redress, that is not an option for women who have worked for their employer for less than two years full time or less than five years part time. Such women do not have any redress against unfair dismissal and run the risk of being sacked if they exercise their rights. That situation is alarming and must be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister has seen the evidence that has been produced by the Maternity Alliance and by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureau. It will be useful if I quote some of the examples provided by NACAB because it helps clients from all parts of the country and does a good job in collecting evidence and producing it in report form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two reports that have been effective in highlighting employers' abuses of employees' rights are "Hard Labour", which deals with poor employment conditions in general, and "Not in labour", which relates specifically to the difficulties experienced by pregnant women employees. The reports include some telling examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A CAB in Essex reported the case of one client who was four months pregnant but whose employer said that she could not have time off to receive antenatal care. That is contrary to the existing, relatively weak legislative provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A CAB in Yorkshire reported that one client was refused paid time off for antenatal care. The bureau noted that her employer was a solicitor specialising in employment law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A CAB in the west midlands reported that a client who had been employed full-time for 25 months was refused time off for antenatal care because to grant it was contrary to company policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A CAB in south Wales reported that a client wanted to give up employment before the birth of her baby and remain out of employment afterwards. Her employer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
would not give her paid time off work to attend an antenatal clinic unless she agreed to return to work after the birth. That is clearly contrary to the existing legislative provisions, let alone the improved system that I hope will be introduced by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the report "Not in labour", a CAB in Essex quotes the case of a client who was expecting a child in August, who had been in her job for 18 months and who was not given paid time off for antenatal care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another CAB reported the case of a client who was expecting a baby in August and who was required to attend an antenatal clinic once a month. Her employers deducted the equivalent time from her holiday entitlement. That is unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that there should be no qualifying conditions for such rights and no qualifying conditions for protection against unfair dismissal. In any society that claims to be civilised, it is totally unjustified for women to have no protection against unfair dismissal. It is essential that employees should be able to exercise their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to quote from the evidence that has been submitted to us by the Maternity Alliance. It refers to the importance to the health of mother and baby of regular attendance at antenatal clinics and classes. I am sure that the Government accept that, but the present law and the Government's proposals do not reflect the importance of regular attendance at clinics and classes. The present position is that time off for that purpose should not be unreasonably refused, but there is ample evidence that that does not apply in practice. The Government should seriously consider that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important and I am sure that some of my hon. Friends want to speak to it. I shall listen carefully to the Minister's reply. It is feasible for the amendment to be made now. It would be a move towards an overall package of maternity provisions and rights in the Bill, which is what we want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a number of our discussions on this part of the Bill there will be major disagreements between Conservative and Opposition Members. The amendment would clear up ambiguity in the effective legislation rather than the intended legislation. I hope that there is no disagreement between Conservative and Opposition Members on the benefits and importance of effective antenatal care. The issue is how effective antenatal care can be promoted to ensure that women have access to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present legal position is ambiguous. We want to clarify it in relation to access to antenatal care and what antenatal care and antenatal classes should include. There is a great difference in tone between the way in which the European Community directive on the matter is worded and the way in which our present legislation is worded. Article 9 of the EC directive states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that pregnant workers within the meaning of Article 2(a) are entitled to, in accordance with national legislation and/or practice, time off, without loss of pay, in order to attend antenatal examinations, if such examinations have to take place within working hours."</p></blockquote>
We have there a clear and positive statement that women should have the right to attend antenatal classes. The difference between that and our legislation is that in Britain the legislation is the other way round. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
intention is to allow access to antenatal classes. According to the present wording, an employer's refusal to allow a, woman to attend antenatal classes should not be unreasonable. The emphasis is entirely negative, not positive, as in the EC directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important. It would tie in with the principle of the EC directive and would show employers that it is good practice positively to allow women to have access to such facilities. Ample evidence exists to show why that is necessary. We have received evidence from the Equal Opportunities Commission. In its written submission to the House of Lords' Select Committee on the European Communities it stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All pregnant workers in the UK have the right to paid time off work for antenatal care … This right has not been well publicised however, and the Equal Opportunities Commission is aware of cases where neither the employee nor the employer is aware of this right".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) gave examples of that, and the citizens advice bureaux went to some lengths to describe the real problems with the existing law in ensuring that the right to antenatal care is a real, not a theoretical one. I was horrified, but not surprised at the example from my own area of the west midlands in the evidence submitted by the citizens advice bureau. A woman tried to have antenatal care during working time. She had been employed for 25 months. However, this was refused, not because something desperately important was happening at work at the time of the antenatal class, but because it was not company policy. That was sufficient to allow the employer to refuse to allow that person time off to attend antenatal classes. Antenatal care during working time in Britain may be available from good employers, who may not only be specialists in employment law but have some sympathy with it and some understanding of the importance of antenatal care. If an employer is not sympathetic, however, the emphasis of the present law of this country does not provide people with a practical right to that care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that if the law states that an employer may not unreasonably refuse access to antenatal care, the employee has the right to go to an industrial tribunal. That is true theoretically, but there is a practical problem. Hon. Members will agree that attendance at antenatal classes is necessary before the baby is born. Under present legislation, an employer may refuse access. If that refusal is unreasonable, the woman may complain to an industrial tribunal, but it may be a year or more before the case is heard. If the woman misses the antenatal classes, access to an industrial tribunal may be of limited use. Similarly, her ability to obtain child care to attend antenatal classes a year or two later may be difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are serious about wanting to provide access to antenatal classes, employees must have positive rights to attend such classes when they need them and not merely the right not to be unreasonably refused, coupled with access to an industrial tribunal when it is too late.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees may have a theoretical right to go to an industrial tribunal, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East said, there are problems. A company such as the one in the west midlands, which considers it reasonable simply to say that it is not company policy to allow women to attend antenatal classes, is unlikely to be liberal with employees who take it to an industrial tribunal. Intimidation, pressure and fear of losing their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0507">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>287</span>
jobs if they make a fuss are problems for employees. Unless we take the opportunity in the Bill to deal with those problems, we shall be guilty of providing a theoretical right, worded in a convoluted way, without giving a practical right to employees. I hope that there is no difference in principle between members of the Committee and that the amendment will be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue is what should be included within the definition of antenatal care. We want it to be clearly inserted in legislation that parentcraft and relaxation classes should be included. I hope that there will not be a difference in principle between Opposition and Conservative Members. As long ago as 1982, in the case of Gregory v. Tudsbury Ltd., it was held that antenatal care was a wide enough term to cover relaxation classes and that, therefore, the right to antenatal care that was introduced in the Employment Act 1980 should be extended to cover relaxation classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the same year—1982—the Department of Employment indicated to the Maternity Alliance that booklets relating to antenatal care would draw attention to the importance of parentcraft and relaxation classes. I am not aware whether that happened, but it seems to be a welcome acknowledgment that those two aspects should be included in the definition of antenatal care. It is fine for us to say that here and for an industrial tribunal to uphold that when it is questioned, but the same issue arises as I mentioned earlier it is important for that to be stated, otherwise employers and employees would not necessarily know that that was the case. I believe that we have the opportunity today to insert that clearly in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tempers may be roused during the course of our discussions in the coming months. I hope that this issue will not cause tempers to flare and that the amendment on antenatal care moved by my hon. friend the Member for Gateshead, East will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel, when I consider the provisions for maternity pay and some of the other limited employment rights in the Bill, that the Government are in two minds—indeed, almost schizophrenic—about part I and part II of the Bill, and onwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's gut instinct is often expressed from the Front Bench. We have all heard, and have grown rather tired of hearing during the past 13 or 14 years, that there should be few positive employment rights and that the labour market should be completely deregulated, because a deregulated labour market would create more employment. The thrust of the Government's argument is that a deregulated labour market leads to cheaper methods of employing people and that therefore there is more employment in the neoclassical sense of the word—that if something costs less, there is more of it, for the purposes of equilibrium. To provide any maternity or employment rights in the labour market will increase the cost of employment. The Government's gut feeling is that they do not want to raise the cost of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been part of Europe since the early 1970s. In other European countries, politicians are aiming for an
	<span class='label label-info column'>288</span>
equalisation of employment rights and labour market conditions across Europe through, among other measures, the recommendations of the social chapter which the Government, in their infinite wisdom, opted out of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In part II of the Bill, the Government have been dragged, kicking and screaming, into grudgingly introducing limited employment protection and rights on to the statute book. The clauses on maternity rights, particularly the one with which we are dealing, are the absolute minimum required technically to put the maternity leave directive into effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to consider the Government's behaviour during the negotiations on the directive. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East said in her excellent contribution the Government have delayed the introduction of the directive and watered down and objected to its original intentions, such as the one that would have allowed women to receive most of their salaries—in one case, the European Parliament ruled 80 per cent—during their maternity leave. After initial discussions on the maternity directive, the Government refused to support it until the right to pay was replaced by the right to remuneration, which was eventually set at sick pay levels. In Britain, such pay is currently between 15 and 17 per cent of average wages, which is hardly a generous amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's approach has changed the situation from one where women can be paid during maternity leave to one where women's entitlements differ according to whether they work full or part time, how long their service has been, whether they qualify and whether they have not qualified before but do now qualify for 14 weeks' leave. There should be a simple and easy right to some kind of maternity leave and maternity pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not seem keen to inaugurate such rights, nor do they seem enthusiastic about the equal rights of women at work being unaffected by the biological fact that they get pregnant. The system, therefore, is fractured.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is less controversial than others, given that it was Norman Tebbit who first talked about allowing women access to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady should refer to him as the noble Lord Tebbit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are quite right, Mr. Knox. I am behind the times. How could I forget the noble Lord Tebbit's elevation to the other place, along with most of the previous Tory Cabinet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was not noble at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Employment Act 1980 first raised the issue. The Government at that time introduced the right to attend antenatal classes but, as with all employment rights that the Tories introduce, they did it in such a way as to make it as hard as possible for people to take it up. The Government introduced the most complex ways of applying for that right and gave it the least possible amount of publicity, so that people would not realise it existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even allowing for the difficult way in which this right was introduced, I do not understand how the Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0508">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
can reasonably object to the amendment. As the law stands, it is not as forceful as in other European countries. We shall see that pattern repeated time after time as we progress through the Bill's maternity provisions and compare some of the rights enjoyed by our European sisters with those of British women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British women have the right not to be unreasonably refused time off to attend antenatal classes. What does that mean in practice? If a pregnant woman is refused time off, how does she set about enforcing her rights without alienating an employer who is not used to taking account of the different, important needs of pregnant women workers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the changing structure of the labour market, many more women work in part-time jobs, which enjoy the least employment protection. Like many other women, part-time women workers get pregnant and have to enforce some kind of employment rights with their employers. Often a pregnant woman does not want to have a huge row with her employer about whether she should be allowed to attend antenatal classes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect, which will constitute background noise to our discussions on maternity rights, is that, as a country and a labour market, Britain is not used to giving rights to pregnant women. Rights have been introduced grudgingly and in such a way that it is difficult for women to enforce them. I believe that, to some extent, women's expectations have been low because they have previously had so few rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people in positions of influence and power in companies, management, the higher echelons of the professions and in this place are overwhelmingly men. They may not have sufficient sympathy for the needs of pregnant women. If more women were in positions of power and influence we might have developed a more sympathetic structure of employment rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some places, there is almost total incomprehension of the needs of pregnant women at work. We must put behind us the traditional idea that women go off and have babies and no one need think about how that impinges on work. In the past, women were expected to leave work almost as soon as they were married. We must make up considerable lost time in our attempts to comprehend the needs of women at work. We must also establish a structure that will allow women to challenge outdated ideas when they confront them in management or in the workplace. Such ideas are based on complete incomprehension of the physical needs of pregnant women in the workplace. We need more understanding among personnel officers and managers so that they can create a more sympathetic environment for pregnant women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the Government's almost antediluvian view of the labour market that wages must be forced down, rights kept to a minimum and employers almost encouraged to exploit their work force. That applies particularly to part-time workers who are not unionised, but atomised, individuals who have to deal with intimidating situations without help or advice. The law provides no easily usable structure to which they can appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to amendment No. 96, I shall be interested to hear what the Government think about including in the Bill an explicit statement to the effect that women should be allowed to attend antenatal classes. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
Minister's colleagues at the Department of Health urge women to attend such classes to promote their health and that of the babies that they bear and, hopefully, to reduce the rates of perinatal and prenatal mortality. So one Government Department urges women to attend classes, but the maternity provisions that we are considering leave attendance up to individuals. They do not provide an easily usable structure which would ensure the best health of women and their unborn children and allow women to remain at work, with the realistic prospect of returning to work after their babies have been born.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall consider time limits and the length of maternity leave later, but there could be surreal scenarios in which women may have to return to work before the baby is born—we are not dealing with an exact science. The Government cannot object to an explicit statement about the right to attend classes which, as everyone acknowledges, would be in the best interests of the unborn child and the mother.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have got off to a good start. Having listened to Opposition Members, one could easily believe that they have fallen into the trap of thinking that if they say something often and loud enough, we shall start to believe it. The fact is that we are making substantial improvements to the rights of pregnant women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members persist in the fantasy that treatment of pregnant employees in the United Kingdom is somehow inferior to that in other EC states. The truth is that, at about 40 weeks, the United Kingdom has the longest period of maternity absence in Europe, and 18 weeks is one of the longest periods of paid maternity absence. In addition, all pregnant employees in the United Kingdom have had the right to paid time off for antenatal care since 1980—a right which will only be enjoyed in socialist France and socialist Spain as a result of the directive. The Bill's provisions will enhance the substantial package of maternity rights, and the employment aspects of the directive will give those benefits to many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is nonsense to suggest that the United Kingdom watered down the directive. The common position text agreed in December 1991 was produced by the Dutch presidency because it was clear that the Commission's original proposal was unacceptable to the great majority of member states. No member state voted against the text of the directive agreed in 1991. The subsequent negotiations which led to the adoption of the directive on 19 October last year have not changed it in any essential way. Only one member state—Italy—voiced reservations about the text and it has now accepted it. There would have been no directive without the lead taken by my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Employment during the United Kingdom's presidency. Her efforts brought the directive to a successful outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nonsense talked by the Opposition is not accepted by the Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that when the directive was before the Fisheries Council for formal endorsement the Government did not vote for it but abstained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that no Government opposed the directive. We made it clear in our manifesto that we would implement the 14 weeks maternity leave before concluding the directive. We stated that we were committed to the right of at least 14 weeks maternity leave and protection against dismissal on the grounds of. pregnancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would make two substantive changes to the existing right. First, it would remove the test of reasonableness. I am amazed that Opposition Members are suggesting that employers should be required to give time off even when that is unreasonable. It would mean that an employee could ask for time off every other day or could make appointments to coincide with the busiest times for the business and the employer would be unable to do anything about it. Clearly that would be an unjustifiable additional burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment would specify that the term "antenatal care" would include
	<br><blockquote><p>"Relaxation classes and parentcraft classes."</p></blockquote>
Such a qualification is unnecessary. The provision in the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 places no requirement on a woman to tell her employer the exact nature of her antenatal care, but only to show on request that an appointment has been made. Antenatal care is a well recognised term and clearly refers to the health care of a pregnant woman and her unborn child during the period of pregnancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the event of a dispute, an industrial tribunal would be capable of deciding whether it was reasonable for an employer to allow time off in the circumstances. Case law has already established that, as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) made clear in his reference to Gregory 	<i>v.</i> Tudsbury Ltd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has been proved through experience that some employers—the 1982 case was well publicised—do not consider parentcraft and relaxation classes to be within the definition of antenatal care and put barriers in the way of women wanting access to such classes when they need them. Is it not the responsibility of the law to ensure that it is as clear as possible? The best way of doing that is to insert it in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No—some of the reasons that I have outlined show that that is not the case. Article 9 of the EC directive states clearly that antenatal care should be provided in accordance with national legislation or practice. The existing provisions in United Kingdom legislation fully comply with that requirement, and I am sure that hon. Members are not suggesting that the directive requires member states to impose an obligation on employers which is unreasonable. The test of reasonableness has been well established by case law. I am unaware of any case law on parentcraft classes, but that is an imprecise term and I see no reason why the 1978 Act should not cover those classes. In the event of a dispute, a tribunal would decide what is reasonable in the circumstances. Reasonableness is wholly accepted in
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
law and has been used on many occasions—first and foremost in the 1978 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that if a pregnant woman wants to attend an antenatal class and has trouble in doing so because her employer will not let her attend, her only recourse is to complain to an industrial tribunal? The case may be opposed by her employer and may have to go to an appeals tribunal. It may be several years, perhaps when the child is already running around, before a decision is made. The Minister knows that the decisions of industrial tribunals are not subject to case law, so there may not even be an established precedent. What kind of right is that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have already told the Committee that there is case law on the matter and the hon. Member for Northfield referred to the tribunal case of Gregory v. Tudsbury Ltd. That clearly established that the words "antenatal care" were wide enough to cover relaxation classes and that, when applying to an employer, there was no need to show the specific reason for an appointment. To remove the word "reasonableness" would not be reasonable. It is well established and has been used many times in employment law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must press the Minister. I believe he accepts that parentcraft and relaxation classes should be included in the definition of antenatal care—whether included in the Bill or not. If an employee approaches her employer and asks to go to a parentcraft class but is refused, what should she do? Should she go to the class or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a decision for the employee. I must tell the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) that even if there were logic in the amendment, a woman would still have to enforce her right by making a complaint to a tribunal, if her employer refused her time off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gather that the Minister has finished his contribution. He made some strange and outrageous comments, especially about the Government's role in passing the EC directive. He said that Opposition Members think that if they say something often enough and for long enough, someone might believe it. Many organisations other than the Opposition are deeply critical of the way in which the Government have watered down the directive. We take back none of our comments on that. There is strong evidence that the Government resisted the directive—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether my hon.

Paragraph 55 on the protection of pregnant women at work was referred to as a matter on which agreement was achieved, but it is not referred to in the summary of successes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey referred to the Government being schizophrenic, which they seem to have been in trying to claim success for an issue upon which they abstained when it was voted upon. That is difficult to understand.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0510">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
The Minister was foolish to make comparisons with other countries on maternity provisions and employment rights. In what other country is someone who has worked full-time for almost two years or part-time for almost five years unable to take action against unfair dismissal, even if that relates to pregnancy? That has been the case in the UK until now, but not in any other European country. Comparison of the conditions governing unfair dismissal in other countries shows clearly that the lengthy qualifying periods that apply here do not apply elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady asked why we abstained. We did so because we believed that the directive had been adopted on the wrong legal basis. Article 118A relates to health and safety and is inappropriate for employment protection legislation. We should concentrate on the fact that we brought the issue to a successful conclusion during our presidency. We abstained on the issue because we did not think that the right legal basis had been used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds even more schizophrenic that the Government should pursue a piece of legislation and try to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion if they were unhappy about its legal basis. The Government often use the legal basis argument to oppose directives when they do not like their substance. That applies especially to social legislation. It is well known that the Government are resistant to such matters being considered within the European framework, never mind which treaty base has been chosen. I see that the Minister of State is nodding in agreement. As a member of European Standing Committee B, I know that the treaty base argument is used by many Ministers to resist legislation that the Government do not like. That argument does not carry weight in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opening speech, I asked the Minister specific questions relating to consultation, in particular to the consultation process that he adopted with regard to this aspect and other aspects of the clauses that deal with maternity rights. The Minister has not answered those questions. Could I also ask the Minister how he hopes to publicise those rights so that people are aware of their existence? As my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey pointed out, many people are unaware of their maternity rights. The evidence quoted from the CABs' findings visibly bears out that fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the Minister believes so complacently that the present system is satisfactory and working well, when we have given so many examples of how it is not working well. Surely the Minister does not doubt the evidence that has been collected by the CABs? The Minister should look at each of those cases and follow them up individually to try to ensure that such outrages do not happen again. I do not understand how he can find comfort in the present system under which, according to the CABs, such cases occur throughout the country. I am sure that many hon. Members know of constituency cases which have been brought to their attention, even if those cases have not been recorded in the systematic way that CABs and other caring organisations rightly feel they ought to be recorded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
It is important that reference to the need for time off for antenatal classes and, as my hon. Friend has said, a definition of antenatal care should be included in this part of the Bill, if it is to be regarded as the main legislation on maternity provisions that people must use to find out their rights. For that reason, we want to press the amendment to a division, but before we do so I hope that the Minister will respond to the remaining outstanding questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall briefly reply to the hon. Lady's two points. First, once the Bill is enacted, we intend to prepare a document which will explain the employment rights of pregnant women. Secondly, I cannot accept that consultation has been inadequate. We consulted widely in 1990 on the draft pregnant workers directive, and in the White Paper "People, Jobs and Opportunities" the Government made clear their intention to include the proof of the employment directive. A consultation document was issued inviting views on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been asked a question by the hon. Member for Gateshead, East and I should like to give her a full response. It was made clear, both in our manifesto, and when the Bill was published, the provisions we intended to follow. There has been wide consultation and people who wanted to make representations have had ample opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also asked the Minister whether he was aware of any other EC country where there was such a long qualifying period—two years full-time and five years part-time—for the right to protection against unfair dismissal. Until now, pregnant women who wanted to exercise their employment rights have had no protection. My understanding is that no other European country has such a long qualifying period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we can discuss that issue when we consider the next clause, but I am not responsible for legislation that was passed in 1975.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have heard the Minister's response. It is well known that the Government have been in power for a great many years. They have had many opportunities to improve the existing legislation, but in most cases they have chosen to water it down, or destroy the purpose of preceding social legislation. I am disinclined to accept he Government's view on that subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disappointed by the Government's response. I thought that the Minister would accept the amendment in the spirit in which it was intended. We did not feel that it would be particularly controversial. Because of the Government's reaction, I press the amendment to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 97, in page
<br><br><!-- lb -->
37, leave out lines 26 and 27.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important amendment because it would remove from the Bill the provision which excludes entitlement to pay. We feel strongly that maternity pay should have been dealt with in the Bill and that it is unsatisfactory for such an important aspect to be excluded from other major changes which are being made to maternity employment provision. Why has maternity pay been excluded and why has the Minister decided not to adopt a comprehensive approach which would deal with all aspects of maternity employment provision?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses state that pay has not been included in the Bill because it is a matter for agreement between employer and employee. It may be the case that levels of pay are determined in that way, but surely it should not be for an employer to decide whether maternity pay should equal sick pay, or should be aligned with normal pay. That has always been decided at Government or, more recently, at EC level, it is not a matter that is simply decided between employer and employee. I do not understand why the notes on clauses suggest that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that we all accept that pregnancy is not a sickness but a normal part of life. I do not understand why the Government are so keen to maintain the link between maternity pay and sick pay. Perhaps the Minister can explain that. Concern has been expressed about the comparison between this country and other European countries. Most other European countries—presumably the Minister can confirm or deny this—link maternity pay with normal pay rather than with sick pay, as happens in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect that causes us concern is that there are so many different levels of sick pay which affect women and which result in many women getting a very poor deal out of the maternity pay, to which they are entitled. The lower rate of statutory sick pay is £45.30 a week; the higher rate is £52.50. There are different rates of statutory maternity pay, of which the lower rate is £46.30 a week. I cannot understand the justification for all the different rates of pay. Some of the rates mean that those people who are on low incomes or who are part-time workers get very little maternity pay entitlement. The Bill does nothing to rectify some of the grave injustices in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
What is clear—presumably this is one of the reasons for the exclusion of entitlement to pay from this part of the Bill—is that during the negotiations on the directive there was a great battle between the United Kingdom and the other member states about maternity pay. Most of the other countries did not see a link between maternity pay and sick pay, but the United Kingdom was adamant that it wanted that link to be continued. The European Commission is on record as saying that the United Kingdom was out on its own on the matter and that the Commission did not understand why the directive should be framed simply to accommodate the interests of one country rather than the other 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the fact that the European Commission was very concerned about the directive being changed to fit in with the interests of one country, the Government succeeded in keeping the link between maternity pay and sick pay. Despite that, and despite the attitude of other member states, the European Commission and the European Parliament, the Government—as the Minister confirmed—abstained on the final form of the directive. That is not a good way of winning friends and influencing people—to stick resolutely to a view on maternity pay and then, when all the other countries concede to that view, to abstain on the final outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pay issue is also dealt with in the Government's amendment and in our other amendments. For that reason, I shall not say any more about the matter. However, we believe that this is a substantive amendment. It is the only way in which we can show our displeasure that pay is not included in the Bill. It is one of the key amendments, by means of which we can show our displeasure with the Government for not having introduced a comprehensive approach to maternity provision and maternity rights. They have dealt with the issue in what has been described by the Equal Opportunities Commission and others, who are critical about the omission of pay as a "piecemeal fashion".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope, even at this late stage, that there might be a deathbed conversion by the Government in response not only to the Opposition's views but to the many organisations that have written to all members of the Committee, making their feelings publicly known about the need to include pay in the Bill and about the need for maternity pay to be linked not with sick pay but with normal pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey mentioned earlier that some members of the European Parliament and some organisations in Europe are in favour of women receiving 80 per cent of their pay during maternity leave. Many people believe that women should receive full pay during maternity leave. They recognise that having a baby is a normal part of life and that it is not meant to ruin a woman's career prospects. At present, in many cases, it almost has that effect, which is very sad. Furthermore, the Minister will not be surprised to learn that we are alarmed by the situation of women who are on low pay. The current position benefits only those who are better off, while those at the lower end of the scale and lone parents suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the next group of amendments we shall discuss several points that clarify the point that while a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0512">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>297</span>
woman is on maternity leave, her employment rights will not only be preserved and protected but will continue to accrue—at least, for some strange reason, during the 14 weeks mentioned in the Bill. We shall discuss what will and will not be included and consider various formulations, except one. We shall discuss the need to preserve all employment rights and to allow all rights to accrue, except one. That one, however we word it, is the issue of women's pay. That is the one subject that we shall not discuss. In fact, we shall jump through all sorts of hoops, discuss all sorts of amendments and try to find all sorts of formulations to ensure that we do not talk about pay. That will exercise us considerably in our deliberations. But why does a Bill that has been introduced by the Minister and projected by the Government and the press as a measure to benefit and preserve the rights of working women omit what is perhaps the most fundamental part of the employment contract—pay. That is neither reasonable nor easy to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said on Second Reading, the Bill provides some improvement on the current appalling standard of employment law in Britain. However, unless we discuss the pay that women will receive on taking up their new rights, the effect of our discussions on providing expanded rights to maternity leave for women who currently do not qualify for it will be substantially reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why does the Bill go to some lengths to exclude the issue of pay, which is the most important part of the employment contract? We know that the roots of the Bill lie in the EC directive on pregnant women. Is it the case that, from the beginning, the directive, which was never watered down by the Government, excluded the issue of pay? If pay is to be excluded from the Bill, was it excluded from the EC directive on pregnant women? I think we know that it was not excluded. Not only was the issue of pay not excluded; it was probably the most talked about aspect of the directive as it proceeded on its long and tortuous progress through Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has already been some discussion about the history of the EC directive on pregnant women. The Minister made clear his view that Britain was not involved in watering it down. It might be worth spending a little time on tracing what happened to that directive. It had its origins in October 1990, as part of the social charter action programme. The European Commission made proposals for a directive covering the protection at work of pregnant women, or women who had recently given birth. We understand from the Minister that, much to the chagrin of the British Government, the directive was introduced under article 118A of the treaty of Rome, which relates to health and safety protection for workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to hear that the British Government did not think that health and safety was an appropriate heading under which to discuss maternity rights. It is rather worrying that the Government took that view, but I could not help but think that perhaps at the root of the Government's worry about maternity rights being discussed under health and safety was not so much their concern that the heading was unsuitable, but that—and I may be being over-sceptical—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

something to do with the British Government's wish to talk about the issue of pregnant women at work under a part of the treaty of Rome that requires unanimity and not qualified majority voting.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the history of the directive, in October 1990 the British Government did not like maternity rights to be discussed under the health and safety provisions. The Commission brought forward its proposals, which we understand were never watered down. What were those proposals? Any woman working from the beginning of her pregnancy, whether full-time or part-time, would be eligible for minimum maternity leave entitlement of 14 weeks on full pay, with the flexibility of further leave on 80 per cent of pay. That was the first issue in those discussions. In addition, there would be two weeks compulsory rest before the birth on full pay. That was the original proposal which, as we have heard, was never watered down. Whether or not it was watered down, the issue of pay and paid maternity leave was integral to that directive from the start of the discussions. What happened to that directive, which initially was not watered down? After several other discussions, it was considered by the European Parliament, which ruled that trying to restrict paid maternity leave to 14 weeks did not meet the needs of pregnant women at work or the realities of pregnancy. Indeed, the European Parliament thought that the period of paid maternity leave should be extended beyond 14 weeks and suggested 16 weeks' leave and two weeks' compulsory rest before the birth. Mathematicians in the Committee will be able to work out that that would amount to 18 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What came out of the European Parliament was not what finally appeared in the directive. Were those the findings of a bunch of Eurocrat lunatics, who sat in Brussels dreaming up wonderful new formulae to deprive employers of their income and to ensure that, because of women's biological make-up, they had vast, ridiculous rights to go off and have babies? Was that the work of a bunch of European lunatics in the EC or a bunch of lunatic MEPs? To judge from what the Government say, that could be their view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not quite like that, however. From the word go, the directive aimed to provide a floor of rights, which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0513">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
several European countries already met or exceeded. The Committee has already discussed today how British maternity rights compare with those of other European countries. Through a selective use of statistics, the Minister suggested that in one respect British maternity rights were greater than those elsewhere. I shall run through the real maternity rights in different European countries so that the record will speak for itself, and I shall happily give way should the Minister wish to question my figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Denmark allows women 28 weeks' leave on 90 per cent of salary; Italy, 20 weeks on 80 per cent of salary; Luxembourg, 16 weeks on 100 per cent of salary; Greece, 16 weeks on 100 per cent of salary; Netherlands, 16 weeks on 100 per cent of salary; Germany, 14 weeks on 100 per cent of salary; France, 16 weeks on 84 per cent of salary; Spain, 16 weeks on 75 per cent of salary; Belgium, four weeks on 82 per cent of salary and 10 weeks on 75 per cent of salary; and Ireland, 14 weeks on 70 per cent of salary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the United Kingdom, which allows six weeks on 90 per cent of salary and 12 weeks on statutory maternity pay, conditional on fulfilling the rigorous qualification requirements of two years full-time or five years part-time employment with the same employer. Statutory maternity pay is, of course, about £40 a week. If a woman does not meet that requirement, the United Kingdom provisions allow 18 weeks purely on statutory maternity pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to deduce from those bald figures, that the United Kingdom comes close to the bottom of the list. They are just the bald figures, however, because the percentages and number of weeks all vary slightly. There is an extra week here and an extra week there. It is difficult to make comparisons because the schemes are so different. To make a true comparison between the levels of maternity provision in the United Kingdom and other countries, we must consider the practical effect of paid maternity leave for women in different countries. A comparison is relevant only when considering what women earn and what they receive in maternity benefit in those countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average wages of women must be related to total maternity pay. The figures are interesting, and damning for the United Kingdom. In Denmark total maternity pay equates to 22 weeks; in Italy it equates to 17 weeks; in Luxembourg it equates to 16 weeks; in Greece it equates to 16 weeks; in the Netherlands it equates to 16 weeks; in Germany it equates to 14 weeks; in France it equates to 13.5 weeks; in Spain it equates to 12 weeks; in Belgium it equates to 11 weeks; in Ireland it equates to 10 weeks. Women in the United Kingdom have to earn the right to maternity provision which women in other countries receive very quickly. For women in the United Kingdom who have worked for the same employer full time for two years or part time for five years, the equivalent number of weeks for the higher rate of maternity provision is eight; and if they have not worked for the same employer full time for two years or part time for five years, the equivalent number of weeks is five. That is the maternity provision in Britain. That is the issue which the
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
Government refuse to deal with in the Bill. That is the background against which the EC directive on pregnant women at work is being discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The directive first appeared in October 1990 and was finally adopted by the EC in October 1992—two years after the original proposal. The Minister said that it was not watered down, but the Committee knows that those two years amounted to a catalogue of stalling, blocking, disruption and fudging; and the country that was responsible for that more than any other was the United Kingdom. The final directive was vastly different from the original because of amendments by the European Parliament and other proposals from various countries. When it was finally adopted, it had been substantially changed, mainly at the insistence of the British Government. Yet at that famous fisheries meeting, the Government could not even bring themselves to vote for the final version of the directive. Britain abstained. It was hardly worth the air fare to Brussels after two years of blocking, stalling and fudging. People were sent to Europe to "not vote" on an issue which Britain had watered down. For the Government now to argue that the reason was that the directive was issued under the wrong heading—health and safety—will not wash. The plain fact is that the British Government did not want an adequate floor of rights for pregnant women at work, for the Community in general or for Britain in particular. We have heard the same story in relation to employment rights throughout the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite all the fudging and stalling, the modified directive on pregnant women at work was finally adopted. It provides not 14 weeks' maternity pay with two weeks of compulsory rest, not 16 weeks' maternity pay with two weeks of compulsory rest, but 14 weeks' maternity pay at the rate that employees would receive if they were absent from work for health reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and many others believe that it is offensive to make any link between sickness and pregnancy. That link arose because of Britain's desire to water down the directive as much as possible. Pregnancy is not ill health and should not be equated with it. It is a small mercy that when the directive was finally adopted an explanatory note stated that if paid maternity leave is given at a level equivalent to sick pay, that should not be taken to imply any correlation between maternity pay and sick pay. I am pleased with that reassurance from Europe, but it would have been simpler to have guaranteed better maternity leave pay at decent rates, so the problem would not have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite all the problems and the watering down, the Government still refuse even to discuss the issue of pay in relation to the Bill. Why? Are they trying to tell us that maternity pay is an issue of secondary importance to be dealt with as an afterthought? Are the Government trying to say that pay does not matter to prospective parents because they have loads of money, or that pregnancy is not a difficult time for many families when expenditure rises? If that is not what the Government are saying, how can they justify exclusion of something of such fundamental importance from the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does not propose a specific formula for maternity pay. We must discuss our views on that. Our views on the level of pay that should accrue to women on maternity leave are clear, and the purpose of the amendment is to allow discussion of that issue in the Committee and on the Floor of the House. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
Government can put their views, we can argue ours and we can put the question to the public so that we can discover which arguments carry most weight. It is not good enough for the Government to duck the issue and to introduce a Bill which they claim will increase the rights of women without including provisions for an issue as fundamentally important as that of paid maternity leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just for once, could we not ensure that Britain does not have to be dragged kicking and screaming into providing adequate provisions for women employees? Even if the Government had inserted in the Bill a provision equivalent to the watered-down version of the EC directive on pregnant women—14 weeks on sick pay—it would still leave maternity provision in Britain way behind that of our European partners and it would still leave most women in Britain worse off than their counterparts in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just for once, could we not take the initiative and include in the Bill the right to paid maternity leave for up to 18 weeks? Could we not deal with the issue of real pay that women receive when they physically cannot work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just for once, could we not show women in Britain that we value them and the contribution that they make at work and show that we recognise that it is the responsibility of a civilised country to ensure that maternity provisions are as good as we can make them? Why not take that approach rather than, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey said earlier, having to be dragged into establishing rights and taking the view that employment rights for women or anyone else must be undermined and avoided if possible? How long can we go on like that and still claim to be entering the 21st century as a civilised country?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 97 does not propose specific recommendations on pay, but I hope that the Minister will accept that it is a subject that we need to debate in the context of maternity leave and other employment rights. We should not try to deal with the issue of pay through some other mechanism, at the Government's whim, out of the public's view and as an afterthought. Maternity pay is fundamental. Levels of maternity provision in Britain are appalling and they will remain so even after the Bill becomes law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East in asking for considerations of pay and maternity pay to be included in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hartley Booth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will not get lost in a miasma of comparisons with other parts of Europe. We need to establish a view of what really happens in the workplace. What happens, as Opposition Members know all too well if only they would admit it, is that if you put too great a burden on an employer, he will seek ways of avoiding that burden and will not employ the women that you hope to help. Conservative Members know that such ambitions are fine, but I support the Bill because it is necessary to assess the practicalities of the workplace. Employers will try to avoid burdens and you will place a considerable burden—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I apologise, Mr. Knox, for using the word "you". If that burden were introduced, it would be a tremendous barrier.

Two different aspects he behind the proposals. On the one hand, there is the contractual way forward and on the other, there is a statutory way forward. With touching

12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, the Opposition believe in contract law. But there have also been lengthy contributions from Opposition Members who believe in the effectiveness of statutory provision. I should like the Minister to confirm that we hope to ensure that employers have the discretion and the scope to award maximum pay or beyond, or to provide what is reasonable in a particular workplace. We would permit unfettered discretion in the place where the employment contract is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about comparisons. We know that the attitudes of employers in the north of England are different from those in the south-east. The provision would allow discretion in employment workplaces so that there would be no barrier to the employment of women.

I speak as a former lawyer—one of many—to the National Union of Mineworkers. I have always tried to balance the needs of employers and of the employed. We need a sense of reality. I have been the butt of many representations by employers in my constituency who are concerned that if the two-year period is removed and 14 weeks' maternity benefit is introduced, they will have to employ extra labour. Some small firms employ only four or five people. I should like the Minister to assure me on that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was an extraordinary contribution, which I found illustrative of the narrow mind set of the Conservative party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To analyse what has been said: the hon. Member for Finchley (Mr. Booth) repeated the words of a former Secretary of State for Employment, who reacted to the publication of the directive in its original form, which would have included full pay. Basically, the claim is that women are burdened; to employ a woman is to be more charitable than to employ a man, simply because a woman has a biological capacity to get pregnant. An employer might have to make payments and provide benefits, so it becomes an extra burden to employ a woman in the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How has that belief come about? Because I intend to return to it later, I shall ignore for the moment the fact that women are often employed part time on incredibly low wages and that more than 20 years after the Equal Pay Act 1970, they still earn only 70 per cent of average male earnings. That is a strange burden. Nevertheless the feeling persists that women are burdens, and that it is a charitable act to employ a woman because she has the capacity to dash off and get pregnant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be grateful if the hon. Lady told us what she thinks are the costs to employers of the current provision and what the costs will be of the provision that she proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I go into detail, I want to discuss the structure of the labour market, the way in which it has developed and what we should be doing to change it to introduce the concept to which the Conservative party pays lip service and about which it does nothing—equal opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Giving birth to a child is a women's privilege, but both men and women have children. For too long, our society has allowed women to carry the whole burden of childcare—in terms of their future career development, their access to the labour market on reasonable terms and their responsibilities for looking after children. The whole burden—I am sorry to keep repeating the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield, but it is not in vain—of childcare falls on the woman, theoretically so that society can carry on and develop. I presume that the Committee is in favour of people having children
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should develop society by attempting to equalise the responsibility for looking after children as between men and women. We should create a society in which men are not required to work all hours in order to pursue their careers, resulting in separation from their children as they grow up. Women should be able to take their rightful place in the work force and to contribute their great talents and different insights and experiences to society. We should not have segregation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Finchley assumed that the situation would be like this for all time and that nothing could be done about it. Women must stay in their place and men should stay in the place which, over the years, has developed for them. I regard society as a far more dynamic structure. We have to get out of the mind-set that sees women as burdens and thinks that to employ them is to do them a favour. Listening to the Conservative party, it would seem that women are regarded as German guest workers in the British economy. They are invited in
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
when there is a labour shortage, paid less money for doing more menial tasks with fewer career opportunities, and not given equal pay even though legislation to grant them equal pay was passed over 25 years ago. They are then expected to slip out of the labour force conveniently should unemployment arise. During and after the two world wars women were treated like that. When the first world war was over, all child-care provisions disappeared and women were expected back in the home. They had to go back to where they came from so that the returning troops could take up their rightful place in our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party does not believe that society should be run in such a way even if society tends towards it at the moment. Employment rights for women that take account of their capacity to have children and of the fact that 350,000 working women a year get pregnant are essential to change the structure of society, so that there can be a shift in gender roles in society and in the work force. Such rights would have the effect of civilising both society and the work force. Women would not be confined to the home. Our economy and country could take account of the undoubted talents and potential of the millions of women who, given the chance, would want more than part-time work. The change would also allow men to spend more time with their young families as they grew up and to play more of a part in raising their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a great believer in levelling up rather than levelling down, where possible. A way of reducing the burden on the potential employer when he tries to decide whether or not to employ women would be to introduce parental leave. We shall discuss such ideas later, but were parental leave introduced and were there a flexible approach, within biological capacities, to allowing the man or woman to take responsibility for looking after the child after it reached a certain age, society could begin to be civilised in a way that the Conservative party has not even contemplated. I believe that Britain is the only country in the EC which has no provision for parental leave. That is pretty barbaric.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to get away from the narrowness of such provisions. We must think in terms of equalling up so that women are not seen as an extra cost when they are employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I applaud the demolition job done by my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield on the history of the directive. He exposed in no uncertain terms, for those who were listening, the Government's reaction and their role in the process. At this stage in the game it is a bit rich for them to be claiming any credit at all. The Labour party welcomes any advance in maternity rights, especially for women who previously did not qualify. However, we do not think that the provisions go far enough. We do not agree with the idea of excluding pay, which has been the objective of the Government for the past two years. The exclusion means that, once more, women find themselves seriously disadvantaged in the labour market. The Government could have introduced other reforms, established other rights and made an advance that was not detrimental to women. It is incredible that the Conservative party is patting itself on the back for replacing the directive's provision of time off on full pay with time off on 14 or 15 per cent of average earnings, which is not the same. That is what is achieved by the exclusion of pay from the provisions of the maternity directive, as expressed in the Bill.

We must stop treating women as second-class citizens in the workplace. We shall not achieve that aim until we improve maternity rights and introduce paternity and parental leave. Therefore, I support amendment No. 97, behind which lies a completely different philosophy of how society and the work force should be organised that departs from the tired old view that women are privileged to be in the work force and should be happy with their lot. They certainly should not. Women still earn only 70 per cent of men's average earnings and they are expected also to shoulder the burden of the biological reality that it is they who bear children. We might have made more progress if the Government had had a more open mind and had taken a positive view of the maternity directive, rather than opposing it all the way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hutton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to contribute to this morning's debate, but I have been impelled to do so by the intervention of the hon. Member for Finchley. Rarely have I heard a contribution so bizarre, although, during the proceedings of the Committee, there has been tough competition for that prize—[	<i>Laughter.</i>]—among Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The underlying assumption behind the contribution of the hon. Member for Finchley needs to be challenged on a serious level. In his short contribution, the hon. Gentleman exposed the fundamental hostility of Conservative Members to the concept of a core of statutory employment rights. There is everything to be said for guaranteeing working people in Britain minimum statutory employment protection. It is perfectly reasonable for that statutory entitlement to restrict what would otherwise be the unfettered discretion of employers to treat employees in whatever manner they thought fit. That is the job of lawmakers. It is not our responsibility to give employers whatever freedom they want to employ labour on whatever terms and conditions they choose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the latter part of the 20th century, as we move towards what will, hopefully, be a new Europe that embraces the notion of social rights guaranteed to our citizens, it is important that the concept of statutory employment protection is advanced in a progressive and positive way. It is deeply alarming that we still hear Conservative Members voice anxieties about the notion of statutory employment protection. Guaranteed protection is an important part of the social fabric of working people's lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrespective of the part of Britain in which one lives—I represent a proud constituency in the north of England—employers should be required to treat their employees in the same way. There is no evidence that employers in the north of England treat their work force differently from employers in the south of England. That is partly why we enact legislation: not only to guarantee workers rights—the Conservatives have been legislating in that area as busily as any other Government—but to educate employers so that they can extract the maximum contribution possible from their employees. There is nothing to be said for creating a framework of employment rights—if that is the right term—which deregulates the labour market. That would lead not to improved quality or to better job satisfaction but to degraded industrial relations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the hoary old chestnuts that Conservative Members always drag up. But on that point, and it is relevant to my contribution to the debate, I hope that the Minister will tell us the details of the cost compliance assessment carried out by his Department into the proposal. I remember a press statement issued by his hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), who is a Minister in the Department of Trade and Industry, which stated that every time the government put forward regulations which would impose a burden on industry they would publish, at the same time, a cost compliance assessment. I want to see that assessment and to hear what the Minister has to say about the cost of the measure. I am fairly confident that the hon. Member for Finchley will be extremely disappointed when he hears the Government's reply. I am sure that the burden which the hon. Gentleman was trying to create from those circumstances would be minimal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On another level, there are one or two other comments that I want to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman continues, does he agree that in judging what the statutory employment protection regime should be, we have to take account of cost? That being the case, what would be the cost implications of full pay during maternity leave and of parental leave, as proposed by Opposition Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Government's assessment of cost compliance that I want to see. I have not been able to conduct such an assessment and cannot, therefore, answer that point. Of course, it is true to say that every type of employment protection measure imposes a measure of cost or, if my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield will excuse me, a burden on employers. That is not in dispute and does not separate the Committee. The question is whether it is appropriate and fair to create those new employment rights, or to extend them in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we concentrate exclusively on cost, we miss a large part of what we should be considering today. We should be discussing improving the working conditions of women and extending their right to have a family while they remain employees. As I understand it, the Bill states that a woman would not receive pay while on maternity leave. That is despite the European Community directive which provides that women should receive a level of pay relevant to sick pay.

I hope that the Government will say when they plan to introduce the regulations on maternity pay. We are discussing an important provision, but what is perhaps the most important element of it is being denied our attention. We do not know precisely what the Government have up their sleeve. That is why we support amendment No. 97. It establishes an important marker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting debate. In fact, it was more interesting than I had anticipated. We have witnessed the total lack of understanding by Opposition Members of the extra burdens that they wish to impose on industry. They represent the party that consistently complains about rising unemployment,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
while on every possible occasion it tries to put extra burdens on employers, which thereby increase the level of unemployment. In future, we cannot accept any lessons from them about the level of unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Member for Northfield told us of the benefits available in other European countries, he did not tell us about the level of female employment in those countries. He praised Belgium, where 44 per cent of women are employed. In France, that figure is 56 per cent; in Germany it is 53 per cent; in Greece it is 41 per cent; in Ireland it is 39 per cent; in Italy—which the hon. Gentleman praised as a model of good employment practice—it is 40 per cent; in the Netherlands it is 49 per cent; in Spain it is 38 per cent; and in the United Kingdom it is 62 per cent. The hon. Gentleman wants to bring levels of female employment in this country down to those of other European countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Northfield spoke for a long time. If he does not like the answers that he is receiving, that is unfortunate. Perhaps he should think a little more before he makes long speeches containing proposals which would have damaging effects on female employment in this country, where we have one of the highest levels of female employment. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley is right when he says that there needs to be a balance and that we need to take account of the costs that will fall on employers, because they will have an effect on the levels of employment that are asked for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Finchley was slightly disingenuous. While I accept that there might be a difference in employers' attitudes to female members of staff, I do not think that that has much to do with geography. It is simply a matter of female employees being treated differently. That has no geographical base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's concern about the proportion of women in employment in this country, will he confirm that those, such as members of the Tory party, who opposed equal pay legislation argued that if equal pay legislation were introduced, it would lead to a reduction in the employment of women in the British economy but that since the equal pay legislation was introduced the proportion of women in employment has increased?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I am dealing with is the fact that we in this country have a record number of female employees. The measures that the Opposition are trying to introduce would reverse that. The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) asked about the cost of complying with these measures. It is between £100 million and £250 million per annum. The Opposition's proposals do not compare very well with that. Are the proposals a manifesto commitment by the Labour party for extra expenditure, or costs on industry? Were we to accept the amendment, costs would be increased by an amount that Opposition Members would not give us this morning. They did not know that their proposals are likely to cost between £400 and £500 million. That figure was not forthcoming I wonder why. Was it simply that they did not know and had not done their work, or would they
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
rather plead the fifth amendment and not say, in case it incriminated their case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no hesitation in urging my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why he and his hon. Friends talk at great length about the costs—or burdens—on industry and employers but fail to mention the costs and burden on women of not being provided with decent maternity provision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed that the hon. Gentleman thinks that the one is not linked to the other. I was asked questions particularly about the provisions for maternity pay. Maternity benefits are a matter for my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security. He is considering provisions which will implement those aspects of the directive and an announcement will be made in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have been attacked even louder—it could not have been longer—by the Opposition if we had not included employment aspects at the first opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister said that I was disingenuous when I compared the treatment of employers in the north to that of employers in the south. Does he accept that my point was solely an economic one—,that other costs of living in the north of England are so much less than in the south, particularly as regards housing? As someone who has been an employer in the north-east, I know that sometimes one can be more generous than in the south.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I might want to reflect on what my hon. Friend has said, but one should not necessarily draw north-south distinctions between employers. I accept that employers may respond in different ways in different parts of the country because of different circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good debate. I welcome the contributions of my hon. Friends the Members for Wallasey, for Northfield and for Barrow and Furness. I also welcome the contribution made by the hon. Member for Finchley. I did not agree with what he said, but we always welcome contributions from the sometimes silent Conservative ranks. We hope that his example will be followed by other Conservative Members who want to express their points of view about such important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister responded, he half-heartedly attempted to answer some of the questions that have been asked. By doing that, however, he prompted more questions from my hon. Friends and I. It would be good if the Government could give us an idea when legislation on pay is likely to appear. The Minister said that that was a matter for his right honourable Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security to decide, but he did not say whether or not he and his colleagues in the Department of Employment had an opinion on that matter. We should be interested in his views on the future pattern of maternity pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Finchley made a provocative contribution. He spoke of the levels of participation by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0518">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
women in the work force of other European countries, but unfortunately he ultimately ruined his case by referring to Denmark, which has not just a high participation rate but high levels of employment protection. The lessons to learn are that the correlation between those two factors is not simple and that there are many other factors that need to be considered. I have said before—and I apologise for being repetitious—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the hon. Lady aware of the considerable debate in Denmark, where people regard the social cost of the legislation introduced over the years as ruinously expensive to their industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is rightly concern in Denmark that that country's high levels of social protection may be undercut by lower levels of social protection elsewhere in the European Community. The United Kingdom has been specifically used an an example in Denmark in that respect. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should bear that point in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, if it is true that poor levels of employment protection promote employment, it seems strange that the United Kingdom has such a high level of unemployment at present. Unemployment is rising faster than in many countries with higher levels of employment protection. That fact bears out strongly the case that there is no simple cause and effect in this matter and that, therefore, my hon. Friends are absolutely right to stress the importance of employment protection for the individual. After all, we are supposed to be concerned about the wellbeing of individuals in their place of employment. It is not a happy situation when people—women in particular—face bad employment conditions of the sort that have been documented in information sent to hon. Members and widely available to the public. The Government should take account of such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not easy to cost the proposals, but the Government have given some figures and the Committee may want to see a detailed breakdown of how those costs were arrived at and the aspects that were taken into account—for example, the skills that are lost to an employer when a woman does not want to return to work, and the cost of taking on a new employee instead of keeping on a woman who has already been trained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many factors must be taken into account in a cost analysis and it is not easy for Opposition Members to do one because we do not have all the advice from Departments which is available to the Government. A detailed breakdown of the costs would be helpful to the Committee so that we can see how they were arrived at and consider some of the underlying assumptions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national pay equity campaign wrote to Members of Parliament about the omission of pay from this part of the Bill. Its members feel strongly, and I agree, that unless there is a positive change on pay, the Bill will do nothing to assist low-paid women whose earnings fell below the lower earnings limit. One in five women will have no right to maternity pay if the Government insist on aligning maternity pay with statutory sick pay. Our concern for some of the worst-off people in society has motivated us to make our contributions this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not happy with the Government's response and we hope that they will provide more details in response
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 86, in page 37, fine 27, leave out "pay" and insert "remuneration".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take the following amendment</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 99, in page 37, line 27, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) the provisions of any occupational pension scheme applying to the employee shall be treated as if they were terms and conditions of the employee's employment which would have been applicable to her if she had not been absent (and had not been pregnant or given birth to a child) and as terms and conditions of the employee's employment not relating to entitlement to pay.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Amendment No. 100, in page 37, line 27, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), 'pay' means a woman's average weekly earnings which in the relevant period would have been paid to her during her maternity leave period under the contract of service with the employer in question and does not include any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which she would have received, directly or indirectly, in respect of her employment from her employer.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Government amendment No. 91.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Government amendment No. 86 substitutes the term "remuneration" for "pay" in new section 33, which ensures that contractual rights continue during maternity, with the exception of wages or salary. This small amendment, which I am sure will be welcomed on all sides, ensures that the legislation achieves its intended effect and that the requirements of the pregnant workers directive are fully implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The subsection, in accordance with the terms of the directive, provides that pay is excluded from the general provision that contractual rights continue during the 14 weeks of maternity leave. However, use of the word "pay" in the Bill would risk too wide an interpretation by tribunals. It could mean that benefits in kind might be withheld during maternity leave. It could also throw doubt on whether pension contributions are payable during this period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is clearly not the intention of the directive and it is not our intention in implementing it. Only monetary payment is not required to be continued, to be replaced
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0519">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>311</span>
by maternity pay. The employee will continue to enjoy all the other benefits under her contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are to be congratulated on identifying the need to tighten up the drafting here and for tabling amendments Nos. 99 and 100 to achieve the same object as Government amendments Nos. 86 and 91. I hope that they will agree, however, that the Government's amendments deal with the problem more succinctly, and that they will therefore not press their amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what the Minister has said. The amendment is helpful and deals with the concerns that we have outlined in amendments Nos. 99 and 100. The Government want to replace the word "pay" with the word "remuneration", but I had understood that, under the Treaty of Rome, the word "pay"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that the hon. Lady is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister, but I have another question. In article 119 of the treaty of Rome, which deals with equal pay, pay is interpreted in the wide sense in which we meant it in amendment No. 100. Why do the Government think that the word "remuneration" is better than the word "pay", as defined in article 119 of the treaty of Rome? We are attempting to give effect to a European directive. Use of the word "pay" would create no difficulties if it were made clear in the Bill that the word was being used in the same sense in which it is used in
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
article 119 of the treaty of Rome. One of the purposes of amendment No. 100 is to discover what the Government mean by the word "pay".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing against Government amendment No. 86. If "remuneration" is a more acceptable term, so be it. The amendment clearly deals with the Opposition's concerns about contractual rights, pensions and non-cash financial benefits. However, I should like some clarification from the Government about the difference between the words "pay" and "remuneration".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Lady. The EC directive on pregnant women refers to payment and allowance, not to pay, as in article 119 of the treaty of Rome, and clearly intends a narrow interpretation, which Government amendment No. 86 would ensure. The wider definition of pay would remove more contractual benefits from women on maternity leave. I want to reassure the hon. Lady that what she is arguing for is contained in the Government amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may press the Minister on that, I understand what he has said about the problems with the word "pay", but "remuneration" seems to be a satisfactory alternative to that because the taxation of company cars—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
