	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 133. in page 8. line 2, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"() The Development Corporation may impose charges on non-residential properties in the bay area, with a view to recovering the operating costs of the barrage:".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take new clause 4— Development Corporation Trust Fund—
	<br><blockquote><p>".The Development Corporation shall establish a Trust Fund into which assets and capital growth income may be transferred, and which shall provide an income to offset the operating costs of the barrage.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In previous sittings, as the Committee will be aware, we have drawn attention to the spiralling costs of the scheme. The amendment and new clause deal with what we consider to be the accompanying fiscal incontinence of the operational costs. I give notice to the Minister, in the gentlemanly spirit in which the Committee has conducted its business, that we hope that he will be able in this debate to provide factual information about operational costs because this is the last time that the Committee will be able to debate this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In earlier debates, we have discovered the capital costs through cost revelation by correspondence—meetings and debates have been followed by correspondence with the Minister. I hope that he will be able to provide the true operational costs—he should surely have anticipated that demand from the amendments and the nature and tenor of my speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The operational cost that we have been using is based on two pieces of information. First, appendix Al-3 table 3 in the January 1990 economic appraisal, which gave the operational costs—revenue in one column, costs in the other—in 1989–90 prices. I hope that the Minister will tell us how those costs have been revised. Secondly, the money resolution and Mr. Nicholas Bennett's explanation of it in the 	<i>Official Report</i> of 25 November 1991. 	<i>c.</i> 729. We need the Minister to give us some information before we can decide how far we should press the amendment and new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of the fiscal incontinence associated with the operational costs. The estimate for the operational deficit in the original private Bill was £400.000. By the time of the economic appraisal in January 1990. that figure had risen to £1.35 million—a trebling of the original estimate. Finally, in the money
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
resolution debate in November 1991, Mr. Nicholas Bennett admitted what, indeed, was in the financial memorandum of the public Bill—that the operational deficit of the scheme would be £1.6 million. It is important to find out how the costs will be covered and whether they can be offset, particularly along the lines proposed in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 13 gives the development corporation power to impose charges, which are to be the substantial offsetting costs of the annual running of the scheme. I have found only one assessment, but my homework and my, usually diligent, burrowing into such matters may have been deficient. The only estimate that I have seen of the amount that would be collected from the charges envisaged in clause 13 is in the appendix to the economic appraisal, to which I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The appraisal was made in January 1990 on mid-1989 to 1990 prices. We were told, for example, that lock usage fees would collect £145,000, marina berths £170,000, mooring fees £75,000, boatyard rental £10,000 and car parking £40,000. An intriguing thing called floating entertainments was to collect £30,000, and other miscellaneous revenue—I know not what—would come to £10,000. That came to a total of £480,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, it was envisaged in January 1990, using 1989–90 prices, that the charges raised under clause 13, with certain additions, would collect about £480,000. The problem is that the same appendix gives, not the capital costs, but the annual operating costs of the barrage, as £1.8 million. That includes £190,000 to be spent on water quality, £260.000 on operation and maintenance of equipment, £250,000 on sewer diversion pumping, £115,000 on harbour management, £510,000 on dredging and £95,000 on capital replacement. There is a gap in the figures in respect of replenishment water, because that figure was prepared only with respect to the mini-barrage. One query with which the Minister should certainly deal relates to the sum of £85,000 for the Wentlooge lagoon. That has been dropped from the Bill, so we do not know what figure should be included for a possible future scheme for alternative feeding grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures continue with £65,000 for groundwater monitoring, £75,000 on water quality monitoring and £70,000 for fish monitoring—that, I hope, means fish passes to make it possible for salmon and sewin to come up and down the River Taff. Finally, nothing is more indicative of the utter sloppiness of the financial assessments of the scheme from the beginning than the entry which as if the writers had run out of ideas for expenditure headings, gives other miscellaneous costs of£115,000. I should like to know before the end of the debate what those other miscellaneous costs cover. The operating costs are estimated in the appendix with great precision, up to the point where the other miscellaneous costs are thrown in. What portmanteau of costs or activities is included in the figure of £115,000 a year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sum total is what Mr. Micawber would call unhappiness. in that by deducting the costs from the revenue one ends up broke—with net operating costs of £1.835 million at January 1990 prices. How is the deficit to be covered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and. I think, other hon. Members raised these matters during the money resolution debate—the most appropriate occasion for raising them—when we heard
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
the latest account of the operational deficit. Mr. Nicholas Bennett, said at column 729 that the net deficit would not be £1.35 million, as was predicted in January 1990, but £1.6 million. I assume that that figure included the £85,000 for Wentlooge, so perhaps that sum should be deducted from the total now. Mr. Bennett told the House not how the deficit would be covered, but how it might be covered, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we are looking to the corporation to carry out a number of activities that will help to recoup part of that sum. The net operating costs of the inland lake will be met by the development corporation during its lifetime, as will maintenance and capital replacement costs."—</p></blockquote>
The costs of the deficit are to be met by the development corporation. We would like to know how. In particular, will the Minister tell us simply and directly whether he can give us a categoric assurance that any contribution by the Welsh Office to the annual budget of the development corporation will not include a penny to cover the operational deficit? The development corporation already receives a significant annual grant from the Welsh Office to cover the variety of costs associated with the barrage, and will continue to receive that grant year after year. Can the Minister assure us that the operational deficit costs will be met entirely by the development corporation's own revenues and commercial activity? That is what I inferred from Mr. Bennett's reply to the House—to me in particular—in the debate on 25 November 1991 when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the corporation is considering several options to provide revenue to cover the operating costs on a longer-term basis."—[	<i>Official Report.</i> 25 November 1991. Vol. 199. 	<i>c.</i> 729.]</p></blockquote>
From that statement, we can assume that nobody but the development corporation will cover the operating cost deficit which, in November 1991, was identified as £1.6 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to tie down in statutory form further obligations on the development corporation to finance and cover the deficit. That is an appropriate step to take, given the history and rising costs of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment. No. 133 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Development Corporation may impose charges on nonresidential properties in the bay area, with a view to recovering the operating costs of the barrage;"</p></blockquote>
I have been moderate in my demands and have not said "will impose" but "may impose". Given the escalating costs of the scheme, there is a powerful case for such a provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 4 proposes that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Development Corporation shall establish a Trust Fund into which assets and capital growth income may be transferred, and which shall provide an income to offset the operating costs of the barrage."</p></blockquote>
These arc practical suggestions for covering the operational deficit of the scheme which has grown since the original private Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall argue the merits of both devices and explain why I am sure that the Minister will have to agree with me. We are told that the purpose of the barrage is to enhance the value of the area and capital property values and that if we do not have a barrage or have only a mini-barrage there will be a decline in property values.
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
We are told that the barrage will result in betterment—I think that is the term—of the properties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the main beneficiaries of this public scheme are to be major commercial developers because the capital and rental value of their property will rocket—I have profound doubts about that—and if the barrage costs the development corporation an operational deficit of about £1.6 million at current prices, those nonresidential property owners should bear some of that cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In new clause 4 we suggest that assets be hypothecated to cover the operational costs of the barrage—an eminently sensible proposal. If the barrage results in the general betterment of capital values and a rise in rental charges, the development corporation will benefit as much as the private commercial developer, but a part of the cost should be earmarked or hypothecated to cover the operational deficit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both my suggestions are moderate, but they come from the best possible source. I cannot claim their parentage, however much I should like to. I should be happy to say that they came from Rowlands' imaginative Merthyr mind. Sadly, they came out of Bennett and Pembroke, which should at least attract the full-hearted support of Conservative Members, although I may lose the support of one or two of my hon. Friends. They are the full-blown ideas of the former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Bennett explained how the operational deficit might be covered:
	<br><blockquote><p>"they include, first, levelling charges on residential and nonresidential property in the bay area".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 November 1991; Vol. 199, 	<i>c.</i> 729]</p></blockquote>
I have resisted the temptation to support charges on residential property even though we are told that the capital value of the residential properties will be enhanced because they look out over lagoons and not terrible mud flats. I have resisted that temptation because I am a moderate man; Mr. Bennett was a bit of an extremist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have borrowed his suggestion—also made on 25 November—that there should be charges on nonresidential property to help to cover the operational costs of the bay. Amendment No. 133 comes straight from the Welsh Office mouth, so I hope that Conservative Members will support it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Bennett went on to refer to other means by which to cover the operating costs, and said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"secondly, placing property owned by the corporation into a managed portfolio designed to provide an annual lease or rent income; thirdly, the transfer of a cash endowment from the corporation into a managed fund designed to provide the necessary annual income and capital growth; and lastly, the possibility of creating a trust fund into which assets and capital growth income can be transferred from the corporation and which will provide annual income. That last option is currently being discussed with the corporation."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 25 November 1991; Vol. 199, 	<i>c.</i> 729–730.]</p></blockquote>
The basis of new clause 4 is founded on an option that was brought to our attention during the money resolution debate, and one that was being discussed with the corporation by the Welsh Office in November 1991.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only are we entitled to be worried about the escalating capital and operational costs of the scheme, but it is beholden on us to ensure that those costs are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
covered in a statutory fashion along the lines set out in the new clause. The promise of further options and discussions of the sort described in the money resolution debate is not sufficient to assure members of the Committee that we shall not be signing, alongside the open capital cheque, an open cheque for deficits, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to establish a statutory basis on which to offset an operating deficit that started at £400,000, but which has now risen to about £1.6 million. Unless we well and truly establish a proper basis on which to ensure that the costs are covered in a manner that does not draw from public funds, we would not be fulfilling our duty as scrutineers of expenditure in line with the tradition on which parliamentary time is based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the amendment and the new clause and then the questions posed by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands). Amendment No. 133 refers to the recovery of the costs of operating the barrage. My immediate response is that the Government will want the development corporation to take the opportunity, when it can to offset and recover those operating costs. Under the Bill, power is given to the corporation to levy charges on boats using the locks or mooring in the bay. In turn, the corporation will be offsetting its costs in the agreements that it makes with developers about sites surrounding the bay. It will be seeking to make the best deals that it can and it does not need new legal powers or, indeed, any encouragement, to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for new clause 4, the corporation will have a limited life. When it has fulfilled its functions, it will be wound up and suitable arrangements will have to be made for the continuing exercise of its responsibilities. There are already legislative powers for its responsibilities to be transferred by agreement to a local authority. The corporation has considered setting up a fund. It would not need new legal powers to do so. However, it would be premature at this stage to require the setting up of a fund. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will want to take decisions on the disposal of the corporation's assets and liabilities at an appropriate time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware of the fiasco of the Jubilee line contributory payment? The developers of Canary Wharf had a moral agreement with the Government to contribute £400 million over 25 years, but there was never a written agreement. As a result, there is nothing binding on the present administrators. Without some form of binding written agreement, as suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, the Welsh Office and its sponsored quangos could get into the same problems and have to rely on thin air when trying to enforce promises later on if things do not turn out as "robust" as the Minister has said. The Government face a major scandal over Jubilee line contributions from the present administrators of Canary Wharf, who are under no obligations. Surely the Minister accepts that it would be better to place in legislation binding obligations on developers and their successors to make them contribute to the public purse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see that references to Canary Wharf or the Jubilee line are in any way relevant to
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
our consideration of Cardiff bay and the development corporation. It goes without saying that the Cardiff Bay development corporation would be looking for the best return when it sets up agreements with developers. References to Canary Wharf and the Jubilee line are irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked me whether the economic appraisal and running costs still represent an up-to-date picture. They do, although the costings might need to be reviewed in two ways. First, they need to be updated in their price basis, which has already been done for the purpose of the financial memorandum. The figure of £1.35 million in the economic appraisal at mid 1989–90 prices was updated to £1.6 million for 1991–92 prices. Secondly, as the hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, it is necessary to remove the running costs of the Wentlooge lagoon at £85,000, but we do not know what the costs might be of any alternative mitigation measures. They will not be known until the study of that possibility is completed. We are not seeking any powers in the Bill to undertake the possible alternative bird reserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I confirm to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney that there is no justification for saying that the running costs are spiralling. I cannot give the assurance that he asks for that the funds from the Welsh Office will not be used to cover the running costs in the early years. That is precisely why the financial memorandum identified the costs as being borne by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It follows that no assurance is possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So, for all the talk in the money resolution about charges and, residential and nonresidential property, is the Minister saying that for an unspecified period the Welsh Office will carry the cost of an annual deficit of £1.6 million on this scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am giving no assurance because no assurance is possible. This has been put in the financial memorandum exactly for the reason that the costs might fall to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The hon Gentleman is asking for something contrary to the reason for it being put in the financial memorandum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, there are figures for miscellaneous costs. In total, they can easily come to a sum of £115,000. I understand that such miscellaneous costs cover matters such as maintaining buoys and lifeboats, harbourmaster's equipment, including a launch, skips for debris removal and many other minor items. I suggest that the £115,000 provided for miscellaneous costs is reasonable and prudent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It must be one of the most expensive skips in Welsh history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that £1.6 million is the burden to be borne by the Welsh Office. Does he envisage that the scheme will be self-sufficient at any stage? If so, will the scheme be self-financing five years after contributions to the operating costs have ceased, or will the Welsh Office make an ongoing contribution to the scheme's operating deficit, which could, as far as anyone knows, persist for five or 10 years? The Minister has spoken of robust assessments. Have such assessments been made
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0273">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
of the operating costs and operating deficit of the scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expect that the net running cost will be reduced to zero as soon as possible. That is what I want to happen. However. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that our forward estimates cannot include the assurance that he seeks. Instead, the provision remains that any net running costs will fall to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. That is why we have included that provision in the financial memorandum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to say that I find the Minister's response utterly unsatisfactory. How can the Minister say that there has been no escalation of costs, given the scheme's history, in which a deficit of more than £400,000 has multiplied to £1.6 million? Is that a stable price basis, and what credence can be given to ministerial statements that, one day in the dim and distant future, the scheme will reach a zero-cost, self-financing basis?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry, but I do not believe that that will happen. Some additional, statutory responsibility must be placed on the Cardiff Bay development corporation to recover the deficit. Given the Minister's incredibly limp reply, we must enforce a statutory obligation on the development corporation and to that end I wish to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 35. in page 8. line 10. leave out "enabling the local community" and insert

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Committee's attention to subsection (3) and the conundrum that all docklands regeneration schemes must confront: the introduction of a new community on to the old bedrock community. As has happened in London, the new community in Cardiff will be expected to have a much higher income than the old community. Consequently, the old
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
community will not be overjoyed by the arrival of people in their midst who have very different incomes and lifestyles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment builds on subsection (3), but tries to define it more carefully and openly to ensure clear public understanding of the purpose of the clause. The amendment was not tabled to oppose the subsection. The Government accept the problem of docklands regeneration and how it is handled in subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, in order to make it clear that water sports in the inland bay should not be confined the newcomers—so-called yuppies—subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Development Corporation shall have regard to the desirability of enabling the local community to participate at low cost in the water sports and other open-air recreational activities permitted in the inland bay and outer harbour."</p></blockquote>
The amendments try to define the "local community" that will receive the special privilege of participating at "low cost" in water sports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the Government wish to ensure that what happened in London docklands does not recur in Cardiff. In London, there was a clash between the cockney culture of the old east end and the yuppies from the City, who wanted flats with boatyards within walking distance of the City. The Government do not wish a similar clash to occur in Cardiff. The Opposition support subsection (3) but we believe that it has been sloppily drafted. The Government have not defined "local community" or "low cost". Does "low cost" mean that local residents' participating in water sports will be cross-subsidised—assisted partly through the operational deficit that was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney? Is it implicit in subsection (3) that Cardiff Bay development corporation will assist the less well off and, therefore, presumably, the original inhabitants of the communities that front the inland bay, or does the subsection apply to a much wider section of the population?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the aquatic environment in which we have worked during consideration of the Bill, the probing amendments constitute a sort of fishing expedition. They are not unsympathetic; they do not seek to wreck subsection (3). Will the Minister accept a tighter definition of "local community"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that we know what is meant by
	<br><blockquote><p>"enabling the local community to participate at low cost in the water sports".</p></blockquote>
However, the definition of "local community" is open to many interpretations. Does it mean the whole of the city of Cardiff and Penarth—the two local authorities with a riparian interest in Cardiff bay? Does it mean those who live within the curtilage of the protected property line and whose properties may suffer adverse side effects? Such people will be compensated, at least morally, by being told that although their basements may be damaged, subsection (3) enables them to participate in water sports at low cost. Do the Government mean a set of wards or individual groups of streets that front the inland bay or are within spitting distance of it on a windy day? We do not know what "local community" means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we think that we have the spirit of what the Minister has in mind. The clause, or something similar, has been part of all the various forms of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
Bill since about version two. We believe that it is meant to reassure the local communities living now in areas perhaps one-ward depth away from the inland bay that they will not be displaced by incomers. People in the bay area at present may fear being displaced by yuppies who own boats and so want to live near the bay. Therefore, such people will oppose the whole bay development because of the worry that the area will become a rich man's playground rather than being a mixed community. Is that what the Minister means?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is encapsulated in a conversation that I had with the chairman of the Cardiff Bay development corporation who said that the prospects of Cardiff bay being a commercial success were related to the number of "dinkys" who could be attracted to live in the area. When I asked who "dinkys" were, he told me that they were affluent couples known as "double income no kids yet." My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) and I then wondered what would happen to the "dunkas". The chairman asked us who "dunkas" were and we explained that they were "double unemployed nine kids already". It is lost in the mysteries of time whether my hon. Friend or myself coined the phrase—my hon. Friend claims that it was me and I claim that it was him—so the authorship is highly sought after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument about the part of subsection (3) that refers to low-cost participation in water sports by the local community lies somewhere in the balance between the "dinkys" and the "dunkas". The Minister should be able to define exactly "local community". Amendment No. 35 specifies a geographical definition:
	<br><blockquote><p>"within five kilometres of the inland bay."</p></blockquote>
That is much better. It covers part of my constituency. Some of my constituents may think that as it stands at present, the subsection could be interpreted loosely as excluding everybody from Cardiff, West from the definition of "local community." Perhaps the Minister does not intend that; he may mean the term to include all the city of Cardiff and the town of Penarth. but we do not know. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will accept the tighter definition in our constructive amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, West has developed an interesting argument and I take his point that the proposal is not intended to be wildly divisive. However, a line of 5 km to define the local community would be arbitrary in the city of Cardiff; it would bring together some odd areas. That definition would eliminate much of his constituency and almost all of mine. I believe that the measure should refer to what we would understand as the local community—the old-established community. I would not expect it to extend to the whole of the city of Cardiff or of Penarth. I shall not go into the authorship of interesting new additions to the language but it is not right to suggest that all newcomers to houses being developed in the bay area will be wealthy. We intend that a significant proportion of that new housing should be socially necessary and provide what is required in Cardiff. The residents of those houses will certainly not be wealthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My attitude to the amendment is that an arbitrary line should not be drawn. I accept the spirit of what
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
the hon. Gentleman said, but the definition should be worked out in practice rather than being specified in the Bill, as the amendment proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it, therefore, that the Minister is saying that communities such as the old north ward of Penarth, Butetown, Grangetown and, possibly, Splott will be included. Will Canton and Riverside be included, too? Those areas, which I represent, feel aggrieved about the barrage. Is what the Minister proposes supposed to be a quid pro quo for the aggravation that the communities have suffered or are those areas regarded as being too far from the inland bay to be possible candidates for low-cost assistance with participation in water sports?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot respond directly to that question. If I were to identify specific communities, I, too, would effectively be drawing a line, as the amendment proposes. It is not appropriate to draw an arbitrary line to define communities within a certain radius. I favour what we accept as existing local communities. I am confident that the issue can be worked out in practice, which would be better than being specified in legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should not spend all day voting but I am not happy with the Minister's sloppy attitude to legislation, which assumes that the matter can be worked out later. I shall not press the amendment to a Division as we may have a further opportunity to probe the issue. The Minister may decide during the summer recess to introduce a tighter, more precise proposal. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister think about the wording of the set of byelaws specified in subsection (5)? There is a similar reference in clause 13 to who the Cardiff Bay development corporation shall be obliged to consult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a former Cardiff city councillor, the Minister will know that the obligation to regulate water sports lies not with the National Rivers Authority but with the Cardiff city council environmental health officer. Subsection (5) refers to the making of byelaws and the need to consult the NRA about water sports. We think that the environmental health officer of Cardiff city council should be consulted. It is on him—or her, as there is nobody appointed at the moment—that we should rely for advice. I shall not press the matter to a vote, but it is a point for future discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers of the city council's environmental health officer tend to be ex-post: after the barrage is built and after the water quality settles down, he, or she, has the duty of working out what water sports should be allowed. Although the execution of the powers of the

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are straightforward. They seek to ensure a permanent place for representatives of Cardiff city council, including a specialist in community medicine, on the advisory committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advisory committee is to be established by the Cardiff Bay development corporation and consulted on matters relating to the barrage area. The Secretary of Slate for Wales has reserve powers over the committee's membership. The Select Committee that investigated the issue of Cardiff bay suggested that the advisory committee, which was to be consulted by the Cardiff Bay development corporation on matters affecting the barrage area, should be dealt with by the Standing Committee. The private Bill envisaged that the advisory committee would include a representative of the city council, although none of us believes that the advisory committee should be large and unwieldy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that Cardiff city council, of which the Minister was previously a member, be directly represented on the advisory committee because it will
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
be a new unitary authority—the only one representing the people of Cardiff. It is, therefore, vital that there will be direct representation on the advisory committee which will deal with the issues, that will affect a large part of our capital city.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason for direct representation is that Cardiff city council is the public health authority and the Secretary of State will make regulations giving it powers over nuisances to public health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past few years, there has been a tendency not to have representatives of directly-elected local authorities on quangos or public bodies in Wales. I hope that the Minister will make an exception in this case because of the highly controversial nature of the Cardiff bay proposals. It is vital that a council representative and a specialist in community medicine sit on the advisory committee. If they do not, I fear that the credibility and confidence of the advisory committee will be seriously questioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I second what my hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) said on amendment No. 11. Cardiff city council feels strongly about the amendment, as do I and many of my constituents—particularly those in branches of Cardiff residents against the barrage—because one of the unknowns about the barrage is its consequences for health. Experience of amenity lakes in the United States of America shows that one consequence of an artificially created lake with nutrient-rich muds on its bed is a large midge population. The midge population of such a lake during the summer is estimated at 11 billion—not an easy figure to grasp. It is the death and decay of midges, rather than their life, which have important health consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another consequence on public health is the rising water table which affects the level of rising damp in properties and results in the growth of mould the spores of which affect the health of children and other vulnerable groups. I am told that those effects can be anticipated. Interesting collaborative work by the department of chest medicine at Llandough hospital, Cardiff city council, Cardiff Bay development corporation and Cardiff residents against the barrage has taken place to try to predict by how much the incidence of conditions such as asthma and eczema could increase in communities near the bay as a result of the barrage. Spores in mould affect people with sensitive lungs and skin, as do decaying midges which can be inhaled as they die. I am not a medical expert and cannot comment. The question is what range of interests should be represented on the bay advisory committee. We believe that the predictable health consequences—which the NRA touched upon in its excellent document—oblige us to think about having a public health expert to represent the interests of the city council and the Vale of Glamorgan were the Minister so minded. Perhaps he will think about how the public health side effects of the barrage will be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, a decision will have to be made about whether midges will be controlled by insecticides or by a natural method such as stocking the lake with coarse fish, if that solution was considered satisfactory. That is the sort of matter on which one would expect to seek professional advice. Where will it come from? We hope
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
that it will come from public health experts appointed by. and representing the interests of. the city council. It would be simple to include the vale if that were thought necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an extremely strong case for amendment No. 11. I hope that the Minister will not reject it and will give it serious thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 deals with whether residential groups similar to those which are combating the barrage, such as Cardiff residents against the barrage, should be represented on the Cardiff bay advisory committee. Although they are anti-barrage, they have amassed a huge amount of expertise on the matter of compensation for damage caused to property by the building of the barrage and its inevitable consequence: a rising water table. What is the purpose of the Cardiff bay advisory committee? Is it intended merely for those who will enjoy the barrage, the lake, the fishing or the yachting or is it meant to act as a sounding board, a lubricant to the system, for those who do not anticipate having fun from the barrage, but want to help to solve the problems caused by the anticipated property damage? We think that such people should be represented. I think that the Minister would acknowledge that the expertise on groundwater that has been built up has been partly incorporated in the enormously long final schedule—the schedule-and-a-half—which refers to the assessment of damage arising from groundwater before and after the building of the barrage. Such expertise merits a place on the bay advisory committee. That is why amendment No. 37 specifies that, as well as the interests of those such as the barrage operators, boat people, the managers and navigators of the inland bay, people interested in water quality and fishing people, those with an interest in
	<br><blockquote><p>"residential, business and recreational land and property within the protectcd property area specified in Schedule 6 to this Act"</p></blockquote>
should be represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 37 would cover people who live in groundwater rise communities, business properties, sports grounds, and those with gardens and allotments who may wonder whether their roses will grow better or worse. There was a great argument in the Select Committee about that. When Mr. Sullivan, the silk who represented the Government, anticipated that roses would grow much better in the groundwater rise areas than they do now. he had to be corrected, and was presented with a rose when he visited Cardiff. The consensus was that his remark was out of place and that roses do not thrive in soggy ground. Gardeners, residents with allotments in areas of rising groundwater such as Leekwith, people who use sports grounds and believe that football pitches will be adversely affected—perhaps those in Cardiff city council's leisure and amenities department or representatives of soccer clubs—should be represented. I should be shocked if the Minister were to reject out of hand such an extension of the committee's representation on the ground that he wanted only the beneficiaries of the barrage to be represented. It must be right to have on the Committee also those with a well-founded fear of adverse side-affects from the barrage. That might make the committee more difficult to manage from time to time.
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
but what is the point of setting up a cheerleaders' chorus on a bay advisory committee? It must include those who think the barrage will cause them difficulty. Alternatively, the Minister might plan more than one advisory committee: one to represent those likely to benefit directly from the barrage and another to cover those who expect adverse side-effects. I do not know what the Minister has in mind. It would certainly be odd to reserve the bay advisory committee for those who expect to be beneficiaries of the extra sports facilities—fishing, rowing, or whatever is eventually permitted by the water quality in the inland lake. I should be interested to know the Minister's thoughts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to talk briefly to amendment No. 134, but before that, I should like to endorse my hon. Friend's point. Advisory committees may be just talking shops; they may be used just as an attempt to ameliorate people's feelings, but they may play a vital part in making the system work and allowing those who have genuine objections to the scheme, or who think that difficulties will arise, to air their views. I wonder, if there had been an equivalent advisory committee to deal with penalties on lorry drivers in France, whether the whole of France would be blocked off at the moment. If there were, not a Napoleonic system, but a genuine participatory advisory arrangement, I wonder whether French roads would be blocked. The tendency to take to the streets or to take action in protest is frequently the result of a community feeling that there is no proper channel for their wishes which are being overridden. My hon. Friend makes a strong point. The advisory committee should not be a barrage love-in group. It should be for people with genuine concerns who have an interest in ensuring that the barrage works successfully because its failure would have a serious effect on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 134 arises out of a previous debate in the Committee. I do not want to suffer your censure, Mr. Winterton, for needless repetition, so I shall not repeat our case about the salmon and the sewin; we shall not go up and down through the fish passes again. But I have followed up the matter by tabling the amendment in a sense at the direct invitation of the Minister. I draw the Committee's attention to our third sitting on Tuesday 30 June at column 88. The case was made effectively by the Minister against my amendment to clause 1 to ensure that angling interests were taken into account, on the grounds that the design of the fish pass had been agreed after much consultation, that the NRA had played a distincive role and that the angling interests had withdrawn their petition as a result. I can testify to that, because I was on the fringes of those consultations and was satisfied that an appropriate arrangement had been made. Although the petition on the design of the barrage was not pursued, the angling interest remains concerned about its operation, management and development. The advisory committee should not only represent those in Cardiff who are directly involved in the barrage's operation, but should give a voice to people who will be affected by its impact on the Rivers Taff and Ely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take some hope that the Minister will accept at least the principle of the amendment, and that he will return with one of his own, from the exchange that we had earlier in our proceedings, I said:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order that we may make progress. I accept that there is no need for further consultation with angling interests … on the design of the fish pass. In return, will the Minister offer an encouraging word to suggest that, when the Cardiff Bay advisory committee is established under clause 18. the angling interests of the Taff and Ely will have a representative on the committee?"</p></blockquote>
The Minister replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall come to that when we reach clause 18—perhaps we shall do so later this morning—"—</p></blockquote>
We have reached it a couple of mornings later—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and I undertake fully to consider the arguments. I hope that the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhmney will not feel the need to pursue the amendment to a vote."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F.</i> 30 June 1992; 	<i>c.</i> 87.]</p></blockquote>
I did not pursue that amendment because I thought that a chink of hope had appeared and that the Minister might recognise that people with a legitimate angling interest in the rivers Taff and Ely—which will be materially affected—should have a voice on the advisory committee, even though some of their fears have been allayed by the physical design of the fish passes. It is utterly reasonable and sensible that those people should be able to raise matters that concern them. I thought that we were pushing at a half-open door when we raised the matter before, and I hope that the door will swing wide open when the Minister replies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to support amendment No. 11, which would require that a specialist in community medicine or public health be included in the advisory committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened intently to the remarks of my hon. Friends the Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) and for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan). I was surprised that the health hazards that could be posed by blue-green algae were not mentioned. It has been conceded that algal scum could be a regular problem in low water in warm summers. Page 16 of the Library's notes on the barrage states that modelling studies show that
	<br><blockquote><p>"planktonic algae could achieve nuisance proportions every year. However, the greatest concen is over toxicity, and here there is a moderate or high risk of potentially toxic surface scums of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) accumulating in 5 to 8 of the next 12 years, with at least a 50 per cent chance of them being toxic. Gastroenteritis can accompany human ingestion of small quantities of contaminated water."</p></blockquote>
Similarly, the National Rivers Authority drew attention to the problem of blue-green algae and admitted that there could be problems with toxic conditions and that fish could be killed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about more than the ingestion of potentially toxic water. I am anxious that the fish that live in the waters may build up accumulations of cyanobacteria. I recall the problems that developed throughout Britain two years ago. Those problems were especially acute in the north-west, where the warm summer caused the regular appearance of blue-green algae populations. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food eventually had to impose restrictions on lobsters, shrimps and other animals caught in coastal waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible—likely, even—that in the waters impounded by the barrage, where angling will take place regularly, there will be problems in the summer. The fish that are caught could be unfit and dangerous to eat
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
because of the blue-green algae. It would be a sensible precaution to place on the advisory committee an expert on community medicine or public health. I strongly support amendment No. 11.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The setting up of the advisory committee is a major difference between the private Bill and this Bill. The private Bill envisaged an advisory committee of 36 which would represent many interests, but such a committee would be far too large and unwieldy. We all want the advisory committee to be effective. I am sure that we all agree that the smaller the committee, the more effective it can be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that Cardiff city council should be represented and that the environmental health officer should be included. Cardiff city council is bound to be represented and I readily agree that environmental health is most important and must be included in the committee's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West referred to some environmental problems. The groundwater protection measures in schedule 6 are designed to ensure that no damp houses are caused by the barrage. Therefore, health problems from damp houses will not arise. Schedule 6 povides not only comprehensive safeguards against damp houses, but a mechanism, through the groundwater complaints administrator, for people to make complaints about the operation of the protection scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not helpful to allocate places on the advisory committee through the Bill. Good examples have been given, but if we set a precedent, another case will be made for other organisations and interests to be represented. As soon as we create one precedent, there will be a next best and a next best and so on. Further cases will be made for representation on the advisory committee which will be almost as good and equally valid. Very soon the advisory committee would be 36-strong and much less effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall the debater referred to by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. As promised, I have looked into the question of angling representation. We have received no representations seeking places on the advisory committee from any angling interests. That is yet another example of a good case and a good cause, but its acceptance would expand the numbers and make the committee less worthwhile.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ultimate logic of the Minister's argument is that there should be a committee of one. The hon.

representation. The Government intend to provide an effective committee which can represent relevant interests and be small enough to operate efficiently. I want the advisory committee to be regarded as a terrier and not the poodle that it might become if the amendments, or the arguments that are being expressed in support of them, were accepted. I hope that we can maintain the concept of an effective advisory committee, which is why I reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The advisory committee will certainly not be effective unless representatives of the Cardiff city council and its public health department are members of it. Unless that authority, which was elected to represent the people of Cardiff, has representatives on what is. after all, a consultative committee, that committee will be utterly meaningless. I believe that the Cardiff Bay development corporation does not want the city council involved in any way with the advisory committee. That is what is behind the Minister's reluctance to accept the amendments. It is shameful and disgraceful that the city council, which will be the only council after local government reorganisation, will not be involved even at that advisory and consultative stage. Such a position does not augur well for relations between the local authority and the Cardiff Bay development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some time ago, we dealt with the setting up of further education funding councils. The principle behind the Minister's argument about the advisory committee is the same as the principle behind the establishment of those funding councils. The Government do not want representatives of local authorities to be members of committees, but want tight-knit groups of people that the Secretary of State will direct and appoint as members of the committee. The public will have no confidence in such a committee, so the Government might as well not set it up. Given that no council representatives will be appointed to the committee, I shall press amendment No. 11 to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Whatever the eventual membership of the committee, it will be for those members, representing a variety of local interests, to regulate the committee's proceedings and to vary them if they think fit. The amendments would remove the committee's flexibility to carry out its work in the way that the committee itself thinks best.

The proposed new schedule would extend the scope of the matters about which the committee could make representations to the corporation. The Bill sets out the matters on which the committee should be consulted or about which it should make representations. Those relate to issues affecting the environment, the amenities of the inland bay and the navigation in the inland bay or outer harbour. The wide remit envisaged in the proposed new schedule would make it difficult for the committee to focus its activities effectively.

about how the Government and Cardiff Bay development corporation will treat those who might be adversely affected by rising groundwater. People should have a reasonable expectation of enjoying the environment close to their homes, even though the water table will be affected by impounding the estuaries of the Rivers Taff and Ely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would oblige the Secretary of State to ensure that regulations shall not downgrade a person's right to compensation. Only increases in compensation should be possible. At present, under the powers of regulation, the Secretary of State can do whatever he likes: any guarantees that the Bill gives with the right hand he can later remove with the left hand. He may pass a regulation late at night, using the various powers that are given to Ministers. That is not good enough. We want a ratchet in the regulations to prevent the Secretary of State from using subsidiary legislation to decrease the compensation to householders. That compensation may be financial or it may involve remedial works being carried out by a bricklayer or a plasterer, paid for by Cardiff Bay development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment were accepted, the Secretary of State could not use the Conservative party's parliamentary majority to reduce the compensation available, in spite of the Treasury's siren words during times of financial distress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The further studies of the barrage proposals undertaken in the past five years by consultants working for the Secretary of State and considered by the House show that the project will cost more than was previously envisaged. That is part of the history of the barrage. I estimate that its cost has increased from £45 million in 1986 to £185 million now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anything that causes the Treasury to get cold feet might mean that the Secretary of State will be told that the regulations must be tightened because there is a tough public expenditure round and there must be no open cheques. People will not be allowed financial compensation for loss of property value and for remedial works. The Secretary of State may suffer an ear-bashing from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, not in a fairyland in the year 2007, but this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in the run-up to another public expenditure round. The Treasury might want to reduce access to compensation or remedial works for householders living in the bay area. It is highly likely, given the latest estimates of the public sector borrowing requirement, that a heavy-duty artillery duel will be fought between the Treasury and the Welsh Office during the summer about the rising costs of the barrage and the knock-on effects on property and the compensation obligations. That is why the Under-Secretary tried to eliminate the £9 million extra compensation, for which the Stoner report allowed. The Stoner report clearly recommended an additional £9 million to cover compensation for additional properties that it calculated might be affected. However, the Secretary of State removed that provision from the financial calculation of the cost of the barrage. That shows that trouble with the Treasury is anticipated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 46 is, therefore, critical. It would ensure that the Treasury could not stiff-arm the Welsh
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
Office to reduce the amount of compensation either by cutting out a couple of neighbourhoods, by removing the choice between the two sorts of compensation—financial or physically bricking up a basement—or by removing compensation for dwindling sizes of basement when the additional course of brick work is built inside the existing course. We know that an almighty bust-up will take place between the Treasury and the spending Departments in the autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I envisage further shrinkage of access to compensation. Amendment No. 46 would prevent such a shrinkage and ensure that the compensation rights of householders in the affected areas were not removed. The areas are not those that we say will be affected, but those that the Secretary of State and Cardiff Bay development corporation say will be affected. The amendment would ensure that some future regulation designed to reduce access to compensation or remedial works by Cardiff Bay development corporation could not remove householders' compensation rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the matter was raised on Second Reading, the Secretary of State only waffled in his attempt to reassure us. He asked us to rely on the Governments' good nature and their need for the goodwill of the people in Cardiff's downtown communities where rising groundwater will probably be a problem as a consequence of the barrage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot rely on the Secretary of State's good nature when we know that there will be a big bust-up with the Treasury in the autumn public spending round and probably in the next round: the latest estimate for the public sector borrowing requirement is £47 billion next year as tax receipts fall and expenditure rises. The Treasury will try to reduce expenditure. Every Department will be asked to slaughter a sacred cow or two. The sacred cow in the Welsh Office will either be the barrage itself—I would not object to that—or the compensation provisions for the barrage, which would be disastrous. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment so that my constituents will be assured that no attempts can be made, through the structure of the measure, to reduce access to compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West made an important point on behalf of his constituents and other Cardiff residents who might be adversely affected by the barrage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of my hon. Friend's comments, I should like to explore the significance of the affirmative resolution procedure in the case of a hybrid Bill, and how far it might allay my hon. Friend's worries. Subsection (3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations shall not be made under subsection (2) above unless a draft of the instrument containing the regulations has been laid before Parliament and approved by a resolution of each House."</p></blockquote>
The notes on clauses contain an interesting further explanation, which might give some comfort to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West. They state that the draft regulations will be a hybrid instrument and planning procedure will afford an opportunity for those affected by them to petition and give evidence before a Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose that the nightmarish events that my hon. Friend described started to occur, and that, as a result
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
of pressure from whatever quarter—my hon. Friend specified one—the regulations had to be amended to include or exclude groups of people. Would every amendment to regulations promulgated under subsection (3), be subject to the hybridity rule and would those affected therefore be given a full opportunity to petition and to give evidence before the Select Committee?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 19(3), will the hybridity rule apply not only to regulations that might be promulgated—they will be the substance of the case and will also relate to schedule 6—but to any future amendments? Will the hybridity rule apply on each and every occasion and will people have an opportunity to petition and give evidence before a Select Committee before an affirmative resolution is presented to, or approved by, the House?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I might have hold of the wrong end of the stick, but that seems to be one example in which such parliamentary procedure could act as a safeguard. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West has outlined the nightmare scenario, we need a belt-and-braces assurance from the Under-Secretary in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Cardiff, West has done it again. He starts with an important principle, but argues his case with such wild exaggeration that he loses any sympathy that might be accorded to his points. I shall try to avoid that danger and maintain my agreement with the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us wishes to see any reduction in the protection contained within the Bill or at any stage in the future. I rush to agree with the hon. Member for Cardiff, West on that point, and I should be minded to concede to any reasonable proposition that he put forward. However, the best advice that I have been able to obtain about the drafting of the clause is that, no matter how it was amended, there would be a danger that some protection for someone could be removed by its alteration. I remind the Committee that, on Second Reading on 25 November 1991, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State gave the very firmest assurances that this provision in the legislation would be used only to improve the protection. My right hon. Friend made it clear that he had no intention of using the power in the clause to reduce the groundwater protection scheme. He said he would be prepared to use the power if it emerged that individuals' interests were not being properly protected by the scheme in practice. That is the firmest of reassurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State were to table amendments, it would be under the affirmative resolution procedure. There would be a debate, which would enable all Members of the House to make representations, not least the hon. Member for Cardiff, West in bringing forward local or constituency interests. The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney is absolutely right to suggest that it would be a hybrid measure so that any person affected would have the opportunity to petition against whatever improvements, if any, were to be introduced. Of course, only improvements would be introduced and the fullest opportunity would be given to consider them. That is the right and most appropriate procedure and it offers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
the fullest reassurance to anyone and everyone in Cardiff who might be affected. There will certainly be no reduction in protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Cardiff, West loses his argument by trying to suggest that the Government have sought to remove £9 million-worth of protection. We have done no such thing. The financial provision provides for the most likely expenditure course and the money is available. The design provision provides for the worst case. It is right that we should proceed financially on the most likely course, but that the design provision has the worst case built into it. In no way, either now or in the future, will there be any reduction or any removal of proper protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the Minister's arguments closely. Will he clarify the position of those who may be left out of the initial regulations? If, for example, the Minister makes a regulation and leaves out a group of people or properties, will those people have the right to petition Parliament under the hybridity rule and have a Select Committee hearing into the reasons why they should be included in the regulation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little hesitant as I am not an expert on hybridity provision. However, I think that I am right in saying that any person who is affected by such a hybrid provision may petition against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy if the Minister pauses to take advice. The question involves the definition of who or what would be affected. Does omission from a scheme qualify a person as affected? Would a person who is omitted from the regulations covering the scheme have a right to petition Parliament and therefore have a Select Committee hearing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afriad that I cannot guarantee that that is the case. I tend to rely on my understanding that any person affected would have the opportunity to petition. I regret that I cannot give the hon.

Anyone who is adversely affected should have every opportunity to petition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is the definition of "adversely affected". People who are excluded from the scheme could be denied a right that they would enjoy if they were covered by the regulations.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is going a little further again. He began by talking about people who were removed, but now he is asking about people who were not, are not and will not be included in the scheme. That is too wide a question for me to answer now.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. Will it be in order to seek a clarification on that point

in the clause stand part debate? That would give the Minister a chance to think about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see no reason why not. That is a constructive proposition. I am sure that the Minister's advisers will examine that matter. The Minister may be able to respond before we conclude our deliberations on this clause, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, West has another contribution to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to respond to what the Minister said in answer to my earlier point that the £9 million is part of the Bill's financing costs. The Under-Secretary is unable to accept that that is so and does not seem to understand the precedents for how public expenditure is handled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State said that his approval of the public expenditure for this Bill would be subject to the Stoner report's recommendations. Before the Stoner report was published the Secretary of State had not said that he would authorise the public funding of the Bill. When the report was complete, he said that he was happy with it and could authorise such expenditure. The Stoner report makes the Bill's public expenditure implications clear. It states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the funds to meet the extreme case have been identified and I consider that the provision will meet the need that may arise."</p></blockquote>
It is all very well for the Minister to quote the Cardiff Bay development corporation to the effect that it believed that run 77 was the extreme case. But the significant factor is how the barrage is designed. Page 9 of the Stoner report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The adoption of the extreme case (Run 77) for design purposes has made a substantial difference to the number of properties."</p></blockquote>
The design of the barrage is based on run 77. Whether Cardiff Bay development corporation thinks that is an extreme case should be neither here nor there to the Under-Secretary; he has an obligation in respect of financial expenditure. Either he is committed to covering that extra £9 million or he is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State approved the barrage design when he accepted the Stoner report in January, making it clear, before the Select Committee started its work, that the money was to be allocated in the event that run 77, on which the design is based, became a reality for people in downtown Cardiff. The Minister now says that, if the groundwater rises to that extent, the money for compensation will not be available. Where will the Minister get the money if he does not ask the Committee to approve its availability? Surely he will not say that it must come from a supplementary estimate or from contingency allowances. It must be an accepted financial consequence of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no wriggling off the hook: either the Secretary of State accepted the Stoner recommendations—that is what people in Cardiff understood him to have said before the report went to the Select Committee—or he did not. If he did not, he is, in effect, saying that people might need compensation but as he is not asking Parliament to authorise it they will be left without compensation. That is an appalling mishmash to present to a Committee that is scrutinising the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is wriggling; it is not right to try to put off, defray or reduce Treasury criticism of the rising costs of the barrage. The additional £9 million was in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>169</span>
the Stoner report and the Minister must commit himself to the possibility that that money will be expended. It should be in the Bill, whether or not more or less than that amount is eventually needed. That is the spirit in which the Secretary of State authorised public expenditure for the measure in late January, following the Stoner report. He had not previously done that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is pure invention by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West. I have neither withdrawn nor refused to accept anything. It was not the Cardiff Bay development corporation but Mr. Stoner who said that run 77 was the extreme case. We have proceeded on the most likely basis, which is the only appropriate way to approach the financial provisions. Within the design we have allowed for the worst possible case. That is right; it gives complete reassurance. There will be no reduction of protection now or in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me correct the Minister Page. 10 of the Stoner report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Cardiff Bay Development Corporation are at pains to point out that they consider Run 77 to be very much the extreme case and would expect much lower levels of groundwater in practice.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments refer to the exceptionally long, 13-page schedule on groundwater protection; there can rarely have been such a long schedule to a Bill in the history of Parliament. We shall have opportunities to debate again some of the many points raised in the schedule, but this morning we want to concentrate on the 20-year limitation on the way in which people can seek compensation—either financial or through remedial works—for damage caused by rising groundwater as a result of the barrage. The lake underneath Cardiff could rise to levels that would affect basements of properties in the area between Rhymney hill and Leckwith hill—the plains, as it were—on which old Cardiff is built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1 to the schedule refers to a survey to establish the pre-existing condition of the building and whether it is dry, wet or affected by rising damp. That would be undertaken as the property owners see fit. After the barrage is built, a survey would determine the consequences of the rising groundwater. People would be given either a grant for loss of property value or a grant to have work done to the underneath of their houses, such as preventing rising damp through the insertion of a damp proof course. Alternatively, basements could be bricked up or given a new inside skin—a waterproof membrane is put on the existing brickwork and a new course of brickwork is put on the inside of that waterproof membrane so that there is no possibility of the ingress of water. The basement ends up slightly smaller, but that is one way of preventing the water that is rising as a result of the barrage from seeping into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have objected to the 20-year limitation simply because the same 20-year limitation has not been applied to the compensation arrangements that we understand have been made for certain larger, more important and better-connected companies such as Associated British Ports, which has a right in perpetuity to claim compensation regarding the side effects of navigation into Cardiff docks. We are uncomfortable with the idea that a 20-year limitation regarding the side effects of the barrage applies to ordinary Mr. or Mrs. Joe Bloggs in inner-city Cardiff whereas Associated British Ports can make claims at any time in the future—for example, to install additional dredging to keep the deep-water channel clear for shipping if it discovers that the deep-water channel is not being scoured effectively by the flow of the river Taff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Associated British Ports has that right because it is such a large and powerful company and could have made much noise otherwise. What is right for the goose is right for the gander. A right in perpetuity to compensation for the side effects of the barrage would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
give the little people of Cardiff the same rights as the big, powerful companies with close connections with either the Government or the Cardiff Bay development corporation. It is not right that two classes of people should be treated differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Cardiff Bay development corporation has argued that any problems will have shown up by the end of 20 years. That might be true for the shifting sandbanks and the maintenance dredging channel outside Cardiff bay, but it has not prevented the Government from making an agreement with Associated British Ports under which ABP has the right to compensation in perpetuity. The problem with the barrage is that no one can scientifically predict its consequences. If Associated British Ports can be given a right in perpetuity to compensation, why cannot those who own terraced houses, small factories, businesses and shops in the area expected to suffer rising groundwater have the same right?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the corporation is right that problems would show up within 20 years at the absolute outside, it would not lose anything by conferring a right in perpetuity to compensation. If it believes that problems will show up well before that time, why does it not advise the Government to agree to such a proposal? We believe that the Cardiff Bay development corporation will want to wash its hands of the problem after a certain time. It could then tell my constituents that it is their hard luck if problems arise after that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the corporation to say to people living in the downtown areas of my constituency, "It's your hard luck", is not good enough for me. It is most unlikely that the Minister will ever be a Labour Member representing Cardiff, West but I hope that he understands the strength of feeling in my constituency none the less. Will he try to put himself in my position and that of my constituents who live in Riverside, Pontcanna, Canton, Victoria Park and Leckwith and accept our sensible plea? We want parallel treatment for Associated British Ports, which has the advantage of an in-perpetuity compensation arrangement, and my constituents, who live in the area that might be damaged by rising groundwater as a result of the barrage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The protection offered by schedule 6 is comprehensive and completely fair. Indeed, some have argued that it is a generous form of protection in terms of the lifetime of the scheme. Protection will be available initially for a period of 20 years from the date of impoundment. Where remedial work is undertaken during the 20-year protection, that protection will start again from the date on which the last piece of work is completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, remedial work could be carried out almost before the expiry of the first 20 years. In turn, there will be a further period of 20 years, which will take the provision up to 40 years. Disturbance compensation will also be available for 20 years. The point at the heart of the argument of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West was examined closely by the Select Committee, which decided not to amend the Bill along the lines of the amendment. It is pertinent to quote the Chairman of the Select Committee, who said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"any damage which may occur as a direct result of the construction would certainly manifest itself within that time."</p></blockquote>
The position taken by the Select Committee and the Bill is right and appropriate. I do not accept the allegations of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West that Associated British Ports has been treated more fairly than those who will be affected by the Bill in that it has protection for more than 20 years. I am advised that the side agreements with Associated British Ports contain a 20-year stipulation like that contained in the Bill and that it will have exactly the same protection. The Bill provides the right period of protection. It can be extended with remedial works up to almost 40 years. The Bill sets out the right provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has confused the protection given to the properties of Associated British Ports and protection granted to ABP in other ways—also in perpetuity. The claim made by Cardiff Bay development corporation is possibly right. But its logical consequence is to make the provision a no-cost option for Cardiff Bay development corporation and the Government. If the corporation is right and any problems do show up in the first 20 years, the amendment would not cost them any money. But it would give additional comfort to my constituents in downtown areas of Cardiff if they knew that there was no limit on the point at which damage might occur. One cannot predict geology well in advance when a man-made barrier such as the barrage is constructed. Let us attempt to comfort people. We should not say, "It's your problem if it happens after 20 years". Damage should be the problem of those who wish to construct the barrage, not of householders if it occurs later than predicted.

	<br><blockquote><p>"or the properly blight arising in the area in general where groundwater damage has occurred.".</p></blockquote>
The Bill omits the concept of property blight. It does not allow for the indirect consequences of the barrage. An entire area might suffer problems arising from rising damp, such as deteriorating values of property and people will need to go through the palaver of establishing a right to compensation. A property blight might occur in neighbourhoods, some of which are on the turn—they can be improved or can become areas of slum clearance. An enormous effort is being put into the rehabilitation of south Riverside and other neighbourhoods. I am glad to say that the Government are giving massive assistance and the city council is making a great effort through improvement grants and other measures. Much of downtown Cardiff was built between 1870 and 1914 during the rapid expansion of the city. Those houses are now reaching their 100-year life span when the mortar and cement begin to deteriorate, the slate nails rust away and the slates fall off. Until the Housing Act 1969 one would have said that if a house reaches the end of its natural life, it can be cleared as a slum and new private housing or council estates can be built, but from 1969 the general consensus was that it was best to spend money to prevent slums. Cardiff has gladly adopted that policy through the combined effect of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 and the Housing Act 1969, which introduced improvement grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If inner city areas of Cardiff are blighted by owners' fear that property values will decline, they will be discouraged from applying for improvement grants. Many people are not eligible for grants now because of the tight means testing. People may be discouraged from investing in a new roof or a new kitchen or attending to the deterioration in the pointing or the woodwork. People in such areas should receive additional compensation. We wish to add to the Bill the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or the property blight arising in the area in general where groundwater damage has occurred.".</p></blockquote>
to cover that problem. Residents in areas such as Riverside and Canton support the amendment. I hope that the Minister will accept it and emancipate people from the fear of decline in property prices and the inevitable effect that that would have on the housing stock in downtown Cardiff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the concept of blight as described by the hon. Gentleman. I do not believe that areas will be blighted by groundwater damage. The effect of the barrage on groundwater has been the subject of exhaustive studies, public consultation and independent advice to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The outcome is that we have every confidence that there will be no adverse effect on property prices. That confidence does not rest solely on the result of the studies. Schedule 6 contains a comprehensive scheme to protect against any groundwater damage. That should provide a high degree of comfort to any present or future householder. There is. therefore no justification for departing from the general principles of the law on blight as they apply to all major capital projects. Far from damaging private interests, the barrage is likely to result in an increase in
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
property prices. Much of the Cardiff bay area could be described as derelict or rundown. The barrage will revitalise the area and turn it into one of the most attractive and dynamic parts of Cardiff. It cannot fail to have a beneficial effect on property values within the bay and in adjoining areas. I urge the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to the strengthening of the provisions for gardens. The Minister will be aware that the Bill has been improved substantially at earlier stages of its consideration to allow for compensation when damage has occurred to gardens rather than to properties. Amendment No. 18 would give some additional strength to that provision and we hope that the Minister will seriously consider accepting the amendments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification about people's residential rights in belonging to, or becoming part of, a protected property area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will hold my hand through the provisions of schedule 6, which, as I understand it, defines a protected property area. Clause 19(2) allows the Secretary of State to make regulations to alter any provision in the schedule. He could alter a protected property area by regulation. Under schedule 6(2)(2)(b), the Secretary of State can also include individual properties that are not covered in the protected property area. Paragraph 9 of the schedule states that certain properties can be deemed to be in the area although there they are not on the protected property map.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been told that if the Secretary of State introduces regulations and people feel that they will be affected, they can petition and bring their case to the Select Committee because this is a hybrid Bill. If the Secretary of State exercises the power of direction under paragraph 2(2)(b) for some houses, but not for those next door whose owners wish them to be included in the protected property area, will those whose houses are not included have a right to petition the House?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Secretary of State introduces a regulation under clause 19(2) and excludes some properties even though the residents feel they should be part of the protected property area will they have the power to petition the Select Committee under the hybridity rules if they consider that they have been adversely affected by not being included in the area? Given the directions in paragraph 2(2)(b), and the powers that the Secretary of State seeks in clause 19(2) to amend the schedule by regulations, what are the rights of residents who have not been included in a protected property area and believe that they should have been?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have, as the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney suggested, sought advice. The good advice that I received confirms the view which I presented this morning. Anyone could petition against such regulations. It would be for the House authorities to decide whether the peitition's form and the timing of its submission complied with the normal rules of the House. Beyond that, the Government would consider the matter of locus standi. If the Government believed that a good prima facie case existed for the petition, they would not challenge the petitioner's locus.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we reach the closing stages of our proceedings, I make a final plea to the Minister about the recommendation in paragraph 7 (ii) on page 9 of the Stoner report, entitled "Special Drainage Measures", which deals with how to drain the urban swamp. I raise the matter under clause 20 because, in consultations between the Welsh Office, the legal departments, the drainage departments and various councillors, the participants expected clause 20 to be the vehicle for incorporating some sort of amendment to the Bill. When the Minister has been asked how he proposes to deal with the legislative effect of the Select Committee recommendations about retro-fitting agricultural-type land drains into urban areas to cope with saturation flooding of inner city Cardiff, he has focused on clause 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A letter dated 22 April from Mr. Martin Evans, to the legal department of Cardiff city council states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am writing now to let you know how we would propose to proceed"</p></blockquote>
—that is, in incorporating Cardiff city council's concerns, which were accepted by the Select Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have accepted the spirit of the Select Committee's recommendation that saturation flooding must be tackled by an amendment to the Bill. We have not been told how the Government will achieve that. Although we shall not consider the amendment, for reasons of political embarrassment—the Government had to admit that they were wrong about the definition of saturation flooding and whether it was covered by the Land Drainage Act 1991—the Minister must tell the Committee where the amendment to the Bill will be tabled. The letter from Martin Evans to Stephanie King-Davies, the assistant legal director of Cardiff city council, refers to possibly amending the Bill to broaden the application of the relevant section of the Land Drainage Act. I do not expect too much detail from the Minister this morning, merely a notification that when the Bill goes to another place clause 20—or another clause—will be amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no precedent for retro-fitting land drains in densely populated inner-city areas. It is an everyday occurrence on farm land and football pitches, where there is no problem with digging deep trenches and filling them with clean stone to drain away surface water. But how will it be done in people's gardens, where there are walls, cycle sheds and so on? Therefore, I hope that the Minister will, in what could be his final contribution to our debate, tell us to which part of the Bill the amendment will be tabled. Will he apologise to Cardiff city council and to the Committee for the fact that the Government have not yet reached a conclusion? Eleven weeks have now elapsed since 22 April and, next week, Parliament will be rising for its summer recess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an appalling discourtesy for the Government to have suggested that they would be providing certain details to those who raised the matter during the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We already knew that. But we do not know what clause is to be amended and how the amendment will be worded.

Will such a power be in clause 20? If not, perhaps the Minister can tell us where in the Bill such a proposal will be. It is all very well for him to say that the matter is being negotiated with Cardiff city council, but it has had complete radio silence from the Welsh Office since 22 April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sewage outfalls</i></p>
	<p>3. Except as may be otherwise agreed by the National Rivers Authority, the licence shall be taken to require that any sewage outfall which will be rendered inoperative or otherwise adversely affected in consequence of the impoundment of water by means of the barrage be removed, relocated or improved before the commencement of impoundment in such manner as the National Rivers Authority may approve.</p>
	<p>	<i>Fish</i></p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>4.—(1) The licence shall be taken to require—
	<ol>
	<li>that at all times during the construction of the barrage the Development Corporation maintain a channel sufficient for the passage of migratory fish to and from the inland bay in which, except where circumstances beyond their control prevent it. the flow of water is not less than the relevant minimum flow,</li>
	<li>that, except where circumstances beyond their control prevent it and except as may be otherwise agreed by the National Rivers Authority, at all times after completion of the barrage the Development Corporation maintain a flow of water through the fish passes in the barrage not less than the relevant minimum flow,</li>
	<li>that before the commencement of construction of the barrage the Development Corporation submit to the National Rivers Authority details of the steps which they have taken, or propose to take, to enable them to comply with paragraphs (a) and (b) above and that those steps have been approved by the National Rivers Authority as adequate for that purpose,</li>
	<li>that the fish passes be approved by the Secretary of State, and</li>
	<li>that the Development Corporation pay to the National Rivers Authority costs reasonably incurred by them—</li>
	<ol>
	<li>in formulating in consultation with the Development Corporation, and giving effect to a programme for monitoring the effect on fish of the construction, and any alteration or replacement, of the barrage and of its operation, and</li>
	<li>in supervising the operation of the fish passes and of the sluices, gates and other parts of the barrage in securing the passage of migratory fish.</li></ol></ol>
	<ol>
	<li>For the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) above the relevant minimum flow of water is a flow not less than that for which the fish passes in the barrage are designed or adapted.</li>
	<li>Where an approval for the purposes of the requirement in sub-paragraph (1)(d) above is given (by reference to the design of the fish passes) before the time when the barrage is completed, the approval may be withdrawn if it appears to the Secretary of State during such period beginning with that time as he considers appropriate for monitoring the operation of the fish passes that their operation is unsatisfactory.</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Monitoring</i></p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>5. The licence shall be taken to require—
	<span class='label label-info column'>180</span>

	<p>	<i>Approvals</i></p>
	<p>6. Any approval requested for the purposes of paragraph 2(1)(a)(ii), 3 or 4(1)(c) above shall not be reasonably withheld.</p>
	<p>	<i>Appeals</i></p>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>7.—(1) Where there arises any dispute as to—
	<ol>
	<li>the reasonableness of the withholding by the National Rivers Authority of approval required by paragraph 2(l)(a)(ii), 3or4(l)(c)above,</li>
	<li>whether, in relation to any work or operation, the requirement imposed by paragraph 2(1)(c) has been complied with, or</li>
	<li>the reasonableness of any requirements imposed under paragraph 2(1)(d) or 5(b) above, the matter shall be referred to the Secretary of State for determination by him.</li></ol>
	<ol>
	<li>Any difference between the Development Corporation and the National Rivers Authority as to whether costs have been reasonably incurred as mentioned in paragraph 4(1)(e) above shall be determined by arbitration.".—[	<i>Mr. Gwilym Jones.</i>]</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. This is my opportunity to say goodbye, as the hon. Member for Cardiff, West requested. But I should also like to thank you and your fellow Chairman for the excellent way in which you have presided over our proceedings. You have greatly aided our deliberations and I look forward to any future opportunities that I might have to take a Bill through a Committee stage under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to thank my hon. Friends, and not least the Whip, who is greatly deserving of my appreciation for his assistance in steering the Committee. My other colleagues have also contributed great thought to the matters under discussion. I am most appreciative of their presence, and, by the same token, I extend my thanks to all members of the Committee. It has been inevitable that our debates have sometimes become a little heated, as this is an important matter which we have debated well. I look forward to the Bill's reappearance on the Floor of the House, possibly immediately after the Recess. I look forward to the Bill's continued progress, as it will be a tremendous advance for the capital city of Wales and for south Wales generally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. Opposition Members are saying au revoir and not goodbye, as we have a number of matters to raise on Report.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>181</span>
However, like the Minister, I wish to thank you. Mr. Winterton, for your guidance and patience in handling a technical and controversial Bill. I am sure that much more will be said when the Bill returns to the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I hope that the Minister will be able to make good, when the Bill returns on Report, the six omissions in the information available to hon. Members. I hope that he will provide details of the side agreements with Associated British Ports—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman is out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
It has been a pleasure to chair this Committee. As an English Member of Parliament, I have become fascinated by the detail of the Bill. I congratulate all hon. Members who have participated in the debates, especially Opposition Members, but obviously I extend the same congratulations to the Minister. They have taken great trouble to deal with what is clearly a very important Bill for the people of Cardiff and surrounding areas. It has been a good Committee. We have flogged out the detail and it has been a pleasure to chair. I congratulate all hon. Members for the interest that they have shown.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
