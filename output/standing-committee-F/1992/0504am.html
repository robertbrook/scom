<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Cook, have joined our proceedings in time for the discussion on the potato industry. This is an important part of the Bill. The Committee must appreciate the achievements of the British potato industry. Given the comments that have been made by Ministers in recent months, it might be thought that the industry has not served this country well. In fact, the quality and variety of the product available to the consumer is certainly among the best in Europe. The per capita consumption is the highest in Europe. Another positive element is the fact that fresh potatoes account for more than 60 per cent. of that consumption. That is a very high percentage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the consumption of fresh potatoes is constantly falling and that only the consumption of processed potatoes is rising?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As living standards rise, people buy more convenience foods—for example, potato crisps. There is a clear correlation between gross domestic product income and the purchases of potato crisps and other processed products. Incidentally, the other day I was distressed to discover that my wife was buying frozen chips. I thought that that was an unnecessary luxury and that we should buy potatoes to make into chips. However, there is a big increase in the consumption and purchase of such processed products.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that it is highly likely that the frozen chips that his wife purchased were made abroad and imported?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>178</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that aspect. The hon. Gentleman has raised a significant point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the framework of this success story is the question of increased imports—I say "increased" but I think that the proportion is beginning to fall—and the extent to which chilled and frozen chips have penetrated the market. However, I hope that the hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) is not challenging the high quality and variety of British potatoes. By any objective measurement, our potato industry is a success story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain aspects of the potato crop make it harder to manage than other commodities. Management regimes are in place for most products. We have a hugely costly EC milk regime and a cereals regime. There is support buying and removal from the market of a range of horticultural products. We also have a sugar regime. Those regimes are hugely costly to the British and European taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial characteristic of the potato crop is the extent to which the yield fluctuates from year to year according to climate. The tonnage of potatoes that will be produced in this country next year cannot be reasonably predicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is a relatively inelastic demand for potatoes. If there were a glut of potatoes, and the price was at rock bottom, it would not result in increased potato sales. It is hard to say this, but most consumers buying potatoes in, for example, the supermarket are not much influenced by whether there is 2p or 3p on the pound. There can be huge fluctuations in supply from the fixed acreage that is planted each year and minimal fluctuation in the demand for potatoes. There is potential for tremendous instability in the price and management of the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only reasonable to try to manage the market. The market is managed for other products. The Potato Marketing Board has been in existence for decades to manage the potato market, and it has done that relatively well. It tries to influence the number of potatoes planted each year. If there were no intervention in the market, there would be a danger that a disastrous year might be followed by a big cut in the acreage planted. Similarly, following a profitable year, there would be a danger of a big increase in the acreage planted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members are aware, a target acreage is agreed by the joint committee and implemented under the quota system. It is important to recognise that the effect of the quota system is not to hold down the hectares of potatoes planted. That is not its purpose and that is not what it does. The quota system attempts to stabilise the hectarage planted at a figure that is decided not by producers but by the joint committee, on which retailers, processors and consumers are represented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without a quota system, in a disastrous potato year there would be a tendency for a producer to slash his planting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That possibility is inhibited by the quota system, which would reduce his quota for ever; he would have cut his potato planting not only for the following year, but for subsequent years. It is false to suggest that the quota system operates only to hold down plantings. It exists to stabilise plantings at a level agreed by the joint committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot just move in and out of the potato industry—at least, one should not. If we get rid of the Potato Marketing Board our standards might be driven down to those of other countries. The industry has high investment, high productivity and is of a high quality. Much planning
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>179</span>
goes into the seed and there is a need for labour to be available at the appropriate time. It makes sense to retain the type of industry that we have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to intervene and take potatoes out of the market for a few years, as we can with cereals. The potato crop, unlike other commodities, cannot be stored indefinitely. Because of those essential characteristics of the potato crop, it is perfectly correct to manage the market. Producer co-operatives are managed in some countries on the continent. The Government's argument is that elsewhere the market is not managed and there is no agreed planting. Those co-operatives have area-agreed acreages to plant and decisions are taken not by a joint committee but by producers alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our arrangements have worked well and the changes that the Government introduced in 1989, which take effect in 1990, were positive. It would be a scandal if, after the Potato Marketing Board faithfully carried out the Government's requirements, the Government were to contemplate seriously winding up the board, even if the EC had no compunction to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like briefly to examine some arguments that have been advanced to give credibility to the hardline free-market doctrine that has motivated the Government's thinking on the winding-up of the Potato Marketing Board. The Bill proposes to wind up the milk marketing boards and the Potato Marketing Board. Why? Has a dramatic change taken place? Those institutions have been in operation since the 1930s. The industry and members of the Committee know that the underlying reason is that the Government are not like the Conservative Government of the 1950s. This Government are hardline, right wing and doctrinaire and they reveal their policies by how they apply them to the management of our agricultural system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. John Selwyn Gummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman like to give the Committee the benefit of his analysis? He said that the main reason for continuing the two boards as they are is that they have in operation for a long time. That is a new socialist view. Will he explain whether he intends that view to spread to the rest of his philosophy so that from now on Labour party policy will be to continue everything that exists and to make no changes? Although such a policy might be more popular than the policies that the Labour party now advocates, it would mark a dramatic change in socialist thinking. We ought to be told of such a change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being a little disingenous. I was trying to explain why previous Conservative and Labour Governments sought to adapt arrangements to meet changes in the market place. After all, it is not as if the agriculture industry is not supported. Sadly, the CAP is a costly method of support. I was simply trying to understand why this Government's policies were not pursued by previous Conservative and Labour Governments. No convincing argument has been advanced for a dramatic change in the marketplace. The only convincing argument would be to wind up the Potato Marketing Board as a result of EC regulations, but I shall return to that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disappointing that civil servants are having to produce arguments that are allegedly based on facts and statistics to justify the Government's political position. The Minister has given many figures on market stability
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>180</span>
that appeard in the report of the House of Lords European Communities Committee report. The figures are intended to show in percentage terms how prices have fluctuated in different countries over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot compare what happens in the British marketplace with what happens in the Dutch or German marketplace. In Britain, it costs £30 to £35 per tonne to take potatoes into or across the country. Given that the average price of maincrop potatoes is £80 to £85 per tonne—I realise that during the past two years it has been much less—a haulage charge of £30 to £35 per tonne creates an enormous non-tariff barrier around the British market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the position on the continent, where there is a range of markets in the same geographical area. It is easy to move potatoes on the continent. Sometimes, they are moved along canals, which is very economical. Therefore, if one country in the European Community is undersupplied, potatoes can be imported from another country as there are no import barriers or controls. It insults our intelligence when civil servants appear before the House of Lords European Communities Committee (Sub-Committee D) and produce statistics to show that the Potato Marketing Board has not introduced stability into the potato market in Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, that is not what the Committee said. It said that the argument that there is greater stability in Britain than on the continent is incorrect. Secondly, if civil servants insult our intelligence, how would the hon. Gentleman describe those in another place who agreed with the civil servants' report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister raised that point. I read that report during the weekend, and I have always held that Committee in high regard. It produced much valuable information about the agriculture industry. However, I thought that that report contained a disappointing analysis. I understand that the Nottingham school of agriculture produced a very good report, of which the Minister will be aware. I have not yet read it, but I understand that it represents a much more objective analysis of the potato industry. It is a pity that that document is not as widely available as it should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are referring to that report, which we have studied with great care, I hope that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang) will admit that the Nottingham report was paid for by the Potato Marketing Board. Having dealt with it in great detail, I hope that the board will ask for some of its money back. I say that because the arguments contained in the report raise many questions. I think it reasonable to point out where the genesis of the report derives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair point. But what is the purpose of publishing statistics relating to stability and prices in other EC countries? There can be only one purpose; it is based on the idea that we can conclude from the statistics that the Potato Marketing Board has not provided stability in the British marketplace. That approach is fundamentally flawed because we cannot compare the potato market in the Netherlands or Germany with the potato market in Britain because our potato market is, to some extend, isolated by the haulage costs of bringing potatoes across the channel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>181</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the problem facing the potato industry is simply that the processed potato industry must pay £20 per tonne more for potatoes in Britain than on the continent? That is why when Mrs. Strang bought frozen chips they were more likely to have been imported chips than chips made from excellent British potatoes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's point shortly. If we consider the importance of that cost differential of the raw material in the production of crisps and chips, we will discover that it is a very small percentage of the cost. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hendon, South understands that in the production of frozen chips, if we take into account the cost of investment, processing and so on, the significance of the raw potato price is small. The differential to which the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food referred cannot account for the position that has arisen in that sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit to the hon. Member for Hendon, South that the Potato Marketing Board is seized of the issue and if the opportunity is provided, there will be increased investment in the processing industry. That is the key. There is over-investment in the Netherlands, which has huge companies. Four of those companies went into liquidation; much of their plant was bought at knockdown prices and there was a large surplus, which is a substantial element in the cost of producing chips. Much of that investment has been bought up and used to penetrate the British and German markets. The latter does not have a potato marketing board, so the argument that our Potato Marketing Board is responsible for penetration of the British market, largely by the Netherlands, is not valid. It is another attempt to use statistics and something that happened in the market to justify a preconceived idea that we should wind up the board because of an element of intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the Potato Marketing Board has failed the country in the seed industry. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's views. It has been accepted that under the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food—this does not come easily from a socialist—the breeding of potato varieties, which included many successes, was focused on the British market and did not consider export markets. Since the Ministry lost control of the breeding of potatoes, there have been signs that we may be able to breed some good varieties that will compete well and replace some of the continental varieties which are grown in this country but controlled by the holders of the plant breeding rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason why we have lost out in the seed export business is the Government's attitude to export credit guarantees. A classic example is Algeria and the Scottish seed industry. When countries wanted long-term credit to continue buying our seed potatoes, our Government, unlike Governments in other countries, were not prepared to intervene to support exports by providing long-term credit. We know the damage that the Government have done to exports over the years and I note that there is a suggestion that they are beginning to backtrack on the policy on export credit guarantees. The position is ridiculous. A few months ago I read in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> that the Export Credits Guarantee Department was making a profit, yet that organisation is supposed to help us to increase our exports and to create jobs. In Algeria in 1990–91, about 6,000 tonnes of seed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>182</span>
potatoes were exported; in 1991–92, 13,000 tonnes were exported. The market collapsed because the Government were not prepared to provide long-term credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman tell us why he thinks there has been such a significant increase in the import of seed potatoes to the United Kingdom from 9,000 tonnes in 1981 to 30,000 tonnes a couple of years ago? The reason cannot be export credit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given the reason for that. The Minister may not have been listening, but I acknowledged that we had a very poor record on breeding seed potatoes. I said that as a socialist it is hard for me to acknowledge that the British Government were the state institution which let us down. Perhaps there will be an improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely that is not what the hon. Gentleman said. He said that when potato breeding was run by the British Government, we concentrated on breeding varieties that were suitable for Britain. In answer to the question why we are importing varieties from abroad, he repeated his statement. If we were producing varieties suitable for Britain, it is surprising that we did not sell those varieties on the home market instead of importing them. The hon. Gentleman is not in command of his facts. The fact is that the British seed potato industry has not performed as well as it might have done. It is difficult to prove that part of the reason for that has been the restriction of the entire British potato industry, because were that the case it would have performed well on the home market and badly on the foreign market. That does not appear to be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Strange</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the Minister deliberately misunderstands. It is true that we are not as successful as we should be, nor as we were historically, with seed potatoes. The fault has nothing to do with marketing but with the product—the genotype of the potatoes. Plant breeding is a long-term process, which takes 10 years. Plant breeders in this country failed to provide a sufficient variety of potatoes. As I understand it, the geneticists involved justify that on the ground that they were concentrating on a particular British marketplace—perhaps the fresh potato trade—and did not pay sufficient attention to the need to develop varieties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not claim to know why our plant breeders have not been as successful as the Dutch plant breeders, but they have not been sufficiently successful and the Government accept that. The problems have nothing to do with the existence of the Potato Marketing Board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In declaring an interest in growing potatoes, varieties have little to do with the issue, but marketing is relevant. Therefore, can the hon. Gentleman explain why the Dutch have been so successful in increasing their seed exports during the past 10 years, when we have hardly increased our seed exports at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that part of the reason—this is where we disagree—is the success of the Dutch potato breeders. The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) knows that we grow varieties in this country which were bred in Holland. We cannot get away from the fact that plant breeders are part of the explanation. I am certain that the PMB cannot be blamed because until relatively recently it was not involved—breeding was controlled directly by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>183</span>
It is important to recognise that the changes introduced by the Government through the review of the PMB were positive. In particular, the formalising of the joint committee was positive—the target area is fixed by a joint committee, which includes representatives of the processors and the consumers. It is not decided by the potato growers alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome later clauses of the Bill that will remove the Minister's role. At present, target areas are recommended to the Minister, but under the Bill's provisions, the Minister will have no locus. I regard that as a positive development. It is difficult to understand why it was right to carry out the review and to entrust the PMB with the implementation of the changes, only to introduce a Bill aiming to wind up the board. There is an onus on Ministers to tell us what has gone wrong between 1989 and 1992 when the Bill was published—what is the reason for the change? Why was the review carried out and positive changes implemented by the board, if it is to be wound up? We could be moving into dangerous territory. I do not suggest that everything about the House of Lords report is bad.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Shell is not a foreign multinational.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. I understand that it was owned by Shell—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Inquiries should be made in the proper manner. There is a procedure, so let us keep to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, Shell is a British-based multinational. I understand that the multinational that now owns Nickerson's Seeds is based on the continent, but no doubt the Minister, who has information at his fingertips from civil servants, can explain the ownership of Nickerson's Seeds if he wishes. However, that gentleman was asked about removing quotas. He replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Well, it may well do so in the long term but the mayhem that would be produced until we achieve that I think would be unacceptable to us."</p></blockquote>
That was Mr. Ian Melrose of Nickerson's Seeds talking about the mayhem that could be created in the potato industry if the target area and quota arrangements were simply struck out. He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If you consider the situation in Northern Ireland at the moment where there is no PMB type organisation, you have a situation where there are 2,700 potato growers with 20 per cent. of the crop in the ground. The latest figure I have is 60 per cent. of these farmers are at crisis level and they are forecasting massive bankruptcy as a result of their inability to market the potatoes. This year already the PMB have injected £14 million into the industry with another £6 million possibly being injected later but I am quite certain if you spoke to any Northern Ireland farmer he would welcome the stability that PMB would have given him in a year like this."</p></blockquote>
That is the important point about the Potato Marketing Board's intervention buying programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spoke to Northern Irish farmers on Friday, at the annual general meeting, and none of them demanded a Potato Marketing Board. They asked for assistance equivalent to that being sought by the Irish Republic. The Minister with responsibility for agriculture in Northern Ireland was able to give them that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>184</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised that they did not ask this Government for a Potato Marketing Board. As the Government are in the process of abolishing the milk marketing board in the Province and winding up the British Potato Marketing Board, it would hardly have been sensible use of a farmer's time to ask whether the Government would introduce a Potato Marketing Board for Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be worth following what the Minister has just said. He said that the Minister was able to give farmers that assurance. Indee he was. He offered them taxpayers' money to buy up, by way of an intervention arrangement, a large tonnage of potatoes in Northern Ireland. That emphasises the point that we are making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that the potato industry is a relative success story, as are the support arrangements. The Minister may recall a debate on the Floor of the House in which the previous Minister, the right hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Mr. Jopling), seemed unable to grasp the fact that there is a world of difference between intervention buying, support buying operated by an institution such as the Potato Marketing Board and state intervention buying by the Government under the common agricultural policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear about the differences. The first big difference is that there is no cost to the taxpayer. I welcome change that is proposed later in the Bill. There is still a vestige of Treasury support for the support buying programme. The Bill will remove that. When the Bill is enacted, no taxpayers' money will go to the Potato Marketing Board to help to finance its support buying programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the support buying programme is not to lift the price to an economic or commercial level but to help to minimise the catastrophe of a very big crop. It is like an insurance policy. Farmers pay for it; and producers pay for it through the levy. It means that, in the event of a very big crop and a rock-bottom price, under the support buying arrangements farmers and producers may receive more than they would have otherwise. That is an acceptable way to support the market in the unique circumstances that I described earlier and when there is inelasticity of demand against unpredictable supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crucial point is that such an intervention programme could not acquire the enormous size of the EC's intervention programme on beef because producers would be running it and could not afford that. There is no danger of introducing an intervention buying programme that has anything like the significance of the open-ended state buying that exists in milk, cereals or meat, where thousands of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money are squandered by buying produce and storing it under the intervention programme. I do not know how much money is made by those who hold beef in the intervention programme, but that subsidised produce is then sold inthird world markets. That aspect does not apply in this respect because we are discussing sensible arrangements for managing our potato market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the alternative? It might be to have an EC regime. From the report of the proceedings of the House of Lords European Communities Committee, one might have received the impression that there was no evidence that producers support the board. Of course they do. I doubt whether there is a Conservative Member of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>185</span>
Parliament whose constituency is in a potato-growing area who has not been lobbied heavily by potato growers in support of the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or a Labour Member of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or a Labour Member. Producers support the board. The poll that they have conducted demonstrates that support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the poll that was published in 	<i>Farming News,</i> which found that
	<br><blockquote><p>"More than half of 500 potato growers who took part in a telephone poll are against the abolition of the Potato Marketing Scheme, although 24 per cent. are in favour".</p></blockquote>
The poll sampled people who were signed up to the scheme and who were practising under it. Is not it remarkable that only half of those sampled opposed abolition? In normal circumstances, one would have expected a much higher percentage. Is not it remarkable that, even at this stage, a quarter of the sample were hostile to the scheme? I would not have thought that that was evidence of massive support. Three or four years ago, had such a poll been carried out among milk producers there would have been overwhelming support for the milk marketing scheme. The poll shows that the Potato Marketing Board's support comes from a fairly soggy base.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether we are talking about the same poll but, no doubt, we can discuss that matter later. 	<i>Farming News</i> stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"More than 70 per cent. of growers in England, Scotland and Wales—accounting for 76 per cent. of the total planted area—declared support for the scheme".</p></blockquote>
I do not want to make a big deal about the poll, and I must admit that I have not studied its basis. However, I know for a fact that there is not a Scottish Member of Parliament with a constituency in a potato-growing area who has not been lobbied heavily on this issue. I am sure that the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland will confirm that. He is nodding, which I appreciate. I would be surprised if Conservative Members of Parliament who represent East Anglia, Lincolnshire or Yorkshire had not been similarly lobbied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said, Labour Members have been lobbied about this issue. Farmers are lobbying Labour Members of Parliament who are committed to their industry, want it to expand and thrive, and are not hung up on right-wing dogma. No matter how strong a case the farmers put to us we have to come in here and vote on measures that we know may not be in the industry's best interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our system of support for the potato industry is good by any objective standards. It has great potential. The changes that were introduced by the Government in 1990 were positive. Although the provisions in the Bill that relate to the joint committee and to the removal of Treasury support are not earth-shattering proposals, I support them. However, the Minister is mistaken to argue that whatever the EC does the board should be wound up. I hope that the Government will reconsider the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the Bill was published in November there was an understanding in the industry—certainly it was our view and, I think, that of the Potato Marketing Board—that the board was under threat because an EC common regime may be developed on potatoes in which case the board
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>186</span>
could not continue. It was only subsequent to the publication of the Bill and to some of the statements that were made by Ministers on the Floor of the House that suddenly we realised that the Minister was arguing for the winding-up of the Potato Marketing Board whatever happened in the EC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We discovered, and I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, that, far from the British representative on the special committee, which answers to Council of Agriculture Ministers, arguing for a regime which would enable the Potato Marketing Board to continue, he was adopting a laid-back attitude. It would be possible to have a light potato regime which would enable the board to continue—there would be no EC regime. It would also be possible to have a heavy EC potato regime which would be involved in support buying and which would go down the same road as those governing other commodities. That would be a disaster.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I read a press report of a speech made by the Minister of State to potato producers in the north of England in which he talked about the possibility of EC intervention buying and the establishment of a common regime. He seemed to be telling producers not to worry about going through the PMB because an EC regime might be created that would participate in intervention buying. I know that that report was an overstatement of what the Minister said and I was grateful for his subsequent clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows as well as I do that there are EC Governments who want a heavier regime. Perhaps he will tell us what happened at the Council of Ministers because his written answer was a disgrace. It did not mention whether potatoes, or anything else, were discussed at that important meeting of the Agriculture Council. I hope that the Minister of State or the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who I hope will speak in this debate, will tell us what is happening in the EC. It would be the worst of all worlds if we replaced the PMB with a heavy, EC common regime of open-ended state buying. That would cost taxpayers much money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have an arrangement that has worked well and continues to do so. Some of the criticisms of it are justified but they are relatively minor and could be addressed. Most of the criticisms are not valid, however, as I have tried to make clear. The board has the support of the industry, and, especially, of the joint committee, which represents consumers and producers. I hope that the Government will think again and will not wind up the PMB.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient if I speak to the amendments that I have tabled, which are purely technical. We promised that we would tidy some of the amendments made in another place, and my amendments are part of that tidying process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East mentioned the history of the PMB and its achievements. The Government do not intend to deny those. We recognise them and the fact that many varieties of potatoes are available in the United Kingdom. I do not want anyone to assume that because we think that there is justifiable cause to question whether the scheme is still delivering all the benefits in the national interest, that, somehow, we wish to pretend that no benefits have been gained or that the board has not been a useful and constructive organisation. I want that to be clear and on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essence of the debate is whether the scheme is still beneficial to the national interest. The Government have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0110">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>187</span>
concluded that there are some very serious questions marks about it, which flow from the changing patterns of trade and the belief that increasing imports, particularly into one sector of the market—a growing sector—mean that we have to reflect on our scheme. I shall return to that point later because it is a crucial one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East and I do not disagree about consumption. The consumption of fresh potatoes has declined from 43·9 oz per person per week in 1975 to 33 or 34 oz at present. The fresh market has declined even though, as the hon. Gentleman said, we are fairly big consumers of potatoes. In the crisp and potato product sector, consumption grew over the same period from only half an ounce to 1·28 oz; the consumption of frozen chips went from 0·65 oz to 2·88 oz. Those are still small quantities in comparison but the trends are clear. Processed potatoes, in whatever shape or form, probably account for more than a third of the market. The heart of the argument is whether, when we consider the overall interests, the scheme still accommodates those changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East made much of stability and instability. To clarify the issue, the argument is whether the United Kingdom enjoys greater stability than those countries which do not have a similarly organised market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what the argument is not about. The argument is whether, in the absence of the Potato Marketing Board, there would be more instability in this country. I have explained that there are very good reasons why there is inherently less instability on the continent—because of the nature of the market and the extent to which potatoes are moved between the different national markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is not whether there is more stability in this country than on the continent but whether there would be less stability here, without the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But one of the board's claims was precisely that it achieved more stability. That is what the argument has been about. We do not believe that that is the case, whatever the reasons. Does the scheme deliver that stability? Our argument is that that cannot be proven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East mentioned the effects of the quota. Of course the quota restrains the sector. There is no point in having a quota unless it has the duel purpose of restraining supply in order to deliver a certain price. That is the whole point of a quota system. If people are not prepared to be subject to restraints, there should not be a quota system in the first place. A quota system limits the amount of people who can grow potatoes. We all agree that it is a criminal offence in the United Kingdom to grow more than a hectare of potatoes for commercial sale unless one does it under the aegis of the Potato Marketing Board. The board serves that purpose. That is the entire purpose of the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister remind the Committee how the quota is set and whether there are consultations with producers, processors and other parties to set the total amount and the types of potatoes grown?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The quotas are set by a process of consultation. The Government accept a hectarage in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>188</span>
light of those consultations. If the question posed by the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) is whether the processors could have every hectare that they wanted, the answer appears to be no. I think that I am right to say that, last year, the Potato Marketing Board controlled about 155,000 hectares but that about 3,500 hectares only were available for contracting directly to the processors. I am not claiming that processors would necessarily buy 100 per cent. of their requirement in the United Kingdom. They might want access to other supplies. One must be realistic. The argument is whether they could reasonably be expected to contract more than they do and, therefore, bring investment back to the United Kingdom. The suggestion of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East that the problem is that there is no processing capacity in the United Kingdom is a classic chicken and egg argument. Would people bring manufacturing facilities into the United Kingdom on a speculative basis without the assurance that they could get the raw material supplies that they needed in the United Kingdom? At the moment they cannot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I right to remind the Committee that, at the joint consultative council, there has never been disagreement about the amount and types of potatoes grown? Is not it the case that there has been no substantive disagreement during the past three years and that the Potato Processors Association is well represented on the joint consultative committee? I believe that it holds three of the 18 places on that committee. It is strange when consensus is not achieved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the consensus were achieved and were so apparent and the arrangements operated impeccably in everybody's interests, it is difficult to know why the processors—to a man as far as I am aware—want different arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because there is a quota arrangement, decisions are set within a certain framework. Therefore, it is not possible to say that we shall act as if the limits did not apply; otherwise, there would be no point in having the quota system. Of course, as the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East said, there has been a crisis across Europe because of very heavy yields. But, this year, the Potato Marketing Board has been buying up potatoes at £10 per tonne, which is way below the formal trigger threshold of, I think, £57 per tonne. We do not know whether people will go out of business. Perhaps, as a result of this year's harvest, some people will no longer grow potatoes, but that would merely continue the trend of several years of fewer people in the industry and the consolidation of production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key argument is whether we believe that the present scheme is flexible enough to accommodate the changing demands in the marketplace. Let us leave aside for a moment the question of compatibility with the EC scheme and consider the scheme on its merits. We do not want to shelter behind EC regulations. There is a case to be argued on the merits of the scheme, which I hope we have done during the course of our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, East should note that it is not just a question of price; there is also the problem of quality. Since the hon. Gentleman quoted some figures, perhaps I may cite a company that purchases all its potatoes in the United Kingdom, Everest Frozen Foods. I quote that company because the Potato Marketing Board cited a recent investment of Everest Frozen Foods as proof that the scheme could continue and that the processors
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0111">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>189</span>
could still be satisfied. Everest Frozen Foods has invested £9 million in frozen potato chip business during the past four years. In the year ending December 1992, the figure was £4 million. Mr. Walker, the managing director, said of that investment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"All this has been done in spite of the potato marketing scheme and had we been in a free market condition, we would have been able to invest greater amounts … We have over the years adopted a policy of buying British potatoes and in fact, for the past 6 years we have been able to hold this line. I must say that this year is particularly difficult and we are seriously considering bringing in potatoes from the continent, to compete not only from a price point of view, but to obtain the quality of potatoes that we need for our process."</p></blockquote>
Just to make clear that I am not breaching any confidences, he then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The figures I have quoted are public knowledge and if you feel so inclined, you may repeat them wherever you see fit."</p></blockquote>
Let us consider also the company Ross Young's, which expects its potato requirements to increase over a period of time towards 100,000 tonnes—
	<br><blockquote><p>"given freedom to trade competitively and to regain volume which has been lost to the Continent."</p></blockquote>
Such remarks have been repeated constantly by processors. Must a scheme come to an absolute end to accommodate their concerns?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important point about the successor regime is that the Bill provides for orderly succession. That would probably enable a development council to deal with the essential parts of the scheme connected with research, development and market identification. As we have agreed, the Potato Marketing Board does not market potatoes; it is a policing agency. The amendments tabled in another place by the Opposition would oblige it to put forward proposals for a successor scheme unless it had held a poll of its producers—which would be faculative—in which case they could opt for the dispersal of assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments are that we have repatriated jobs and exported jobs and acreage. There is, at least, an opportunity—I put it no stronger than that—for them to come back to the United Kingdom under a different sort of organisation. It is clear that that is unlikely to happen under the present arrangements. My right hon. Friend the Minister intends to make some remarks during the clause stand part debate and, perhaps, it would be appropriate if he told the Committee in detail what happened in the Agriculture Council. I was unable to attend its most recent meeting because I was in Committee, but my right hon. Friend represented the United Kingdom and he will give the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East the information that he seeks. The Government cannot accept the argument that we can reach a conclusion on the board's future only in the context of the EC regulation. We must be able to say that there is an intrinsic case for change; that, after due consideration, that that case has been made and that we have put in place the means by which the best elements of the board can be carried through to maintain some certainty for growers. In that way, the points which the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East lauded could also be carried through. In the light of that, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the benefit of the Committee, it may be politic to explain that I have allowed some licence in our debate, which has been wide ranging. That was deliberate because the group of amendments is wide ranging, but I should warn the Committee that we may not have a clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>190</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At about this time yesterday, I was enjoying the coastal footpath of Cornwall and, as is almost inevitable on such occasions, I was lobbied. I shall not quote any polls this morning, but will simply report the views of the members of the farming community who joined me on that walk, including an influential member of the National Fanners Union, a land agent of one of the major land agents of Cornwall. Their view is that we have reached a turning point or watershed in the Bill. They pressed me to say why the first 21 clauses go into such extraordinary detail about what we are looking for in relation to milk, when those dealing with potatoes are simply a potato in a poke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To demonstrate that that view is not confined to Cornish sceptical farmers, I shall quote from a letter from M. H. Petch Ltd, a company of Winley Hill farm, Great Ay ton, near Middlesbrough. Mr. Petch stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have the most efficient and advanced potato production in Europe. We have the best quality potatoes in variety: for chips, bakers or processing etc, and tubers without damage or defect, produced anywhere in the world.</p></blockquote>
Mr. Petch continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have been farming for 42 years. I have a "family" farm of 330 acres, 75 of which are potatoes. Staffing consists of myself and my son plus a little casual help, but if Potato Quota goes, so does this family unit, because the consistency will disappear.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Please ask Mr. Gummer to listen to the whole of the Potato Industry, and not just the "Big Processors", who on David Curry's own admission"—</p></blockquote>
at a meeting at Fairfield Manor hotel, York on 4 March 1993—
	<br><blockquote><p>"threatened not to invest in this country unless they have unrestricted acreage. This in many farmers' eyes is blackmail and is not borne out by the facts—McCains £4M investment programme underway, Everest Wolverhampton £3¾M already spent."</p></blockquote>
That is not the action of large companies—they take a prudent view of investment—that think that somehow or other the market system in this country is working to their disadvantage, unless they know something that we do not. That question must always be asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are being asked to move from a managed potato market to a new regime, as with milk. The big difference is that, partly as a result of our proceedings, we have a clear idea of where the milk industry is going. We know the sort of features that the Minister will consider when examining a scheme for approval. With potatoes, as the Minister made clear, there may or may not be an intrinsic case for change, and we have no suggestion about where that change will take us. By definition, no intrinsic case exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What seems to be happening is that potato producers are being expected to accept the Minister's intentions on trust. They are being asked to walk the plank blindfold when they have no idea of what is below and whether there are sharks. I am not pointing my finger at any part of the processing industry but there are some very big boys out there, compared with the large number of small producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's role is critical, hence the amendments. What does "expedient" mean? I am sure that we have all used the word on occasions and it can be used to prove anything or to excuse anything. Clause 22 presents an interesting contrast to the Minister's existing powers. The PMB stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This clause contrasts with the present law, which requires first—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>the Ministers to form the opinion that the Scheme is contrary to the interests of consumers or of a substantial number of persons affected by the Scheme and that it is not in the public interest.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0112">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>191</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>and second</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>the Ministers to then lay a draft order revoking the Scheme before both Houses of Parliament and only if each House resolves to approve the order must the Ministers make such an order."</p></blockquote>
That was written by our forefathers with great care because otherwise it would be too easy for Ministers to tear up the scheme without proper consultation or assessment of the interests of the different parties.

Earlier in our proceedings, we tried our hand at finding an appropriate little motto to put above the Doors of the Committee Rooms. I suggested "If it works, don't fix it." The Minister, who is better educated than the rest of us, managed to translate that into Latin and no doubt he will give us the benefit of that again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be a difference of opinion on the quality of the Minister's syntax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it" may be a good maxim for the House, but not for the scheme. It has its faults and we know that the quota system is restrictive—the Minister made it clear that that is the nature of the scheme. What we do not know is where he is taking us from the scheme and quotas. I submit that the burden of proof should be on those who say that the new market scheme will be a lot better than the old one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My questions may be slightly different from those already put, but we all expect some answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East referred to his wife's recent purchasing habits. I can give him good advice from my wife who has planted some Pentland Javelins which are rising nicely and which I understand come from the hon. Gentleman's neck of the woods. I am not an expert on the agricultural side of gardening and all I know is that the plot takes up approximately the same amount of space as the Government Benches in the Committee Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first serious question is contentious. Regrettably there are two links between the beer industry and the processed potato industry regarding health. We are advised not to consume too much beer because it is bad for our health, but I am always nervous that by consuming large amounts of beer I am making donations to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>192</span>
Conservative party. The same can be said to apply to the processed potato industry. Small amounts of processed potato may not do one too much harm but too much processed potato does one harm and in many cases results in donations to the Conservative party. I hope that Ministers and Conservative Members will be more forthcoming than they were recently on the Floor of the House, when my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East asked about the connection between the processed potato industry and Conservative party donations. I hope that this important matter will not be influenced by that connection.

	<i>The Scotsman</i> of 29 March reported how farmers in Perthshire had called for the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to be sacked
	<br><blockquote><p>"in view of his intransigent attitude towards the future of the Potato Marketing Scheme … In a statement, released by Perth area NFU at the weekend, it was claimed that the minister had ignored the feelings of the majority of producers and that his desire to see the scheme abolished was 'a wanton act of criminal destruction' … Reacting to the second reading of the Agriculture Bill which paved the way for the dissolution of the Potato Marketing Scheme and an immasculation of the Potato Marketing Board's powers, Perthshire potato producers singled out the Agriculture minister as the perpetrator of the crime … 'The failure to accept the arguments in favour of the board's retention also clearly illustrates his total lack of knowledge and understanding of the potato industry … In view of his complete rejection of the desires of the industry we call on the Prime Minister to act immediately and have him replaced as minister of Agriculture,' said the statement".</p></blockquote>
The report includes an important footnote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the scheme—which is producer-financed—was abandoned, growers claimed that more than 900 jobs were likely to be lost directly in the farming industry in Tayside alone and many more would go in the ancillary trades."</p></blockquote>
In his opening remarks, the Minister said something quite different. I accept that the argument that a different approach would have beneficial effects on employment is a subjective area of debate. Such matters have to be considered extremely seriously in our deliberations today. It is clear that Conservative Members have mixed views. The 	<i>Northern Echo</i> reported the hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague) as saying that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"abolition of the Potato Marketing Board would not achieve free and fair trade".</p></blockquote>
Such points have to be examined in detail. In considering them, I hope that the Minister will also give careful consideration to the questions raised in the letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the eventuality of a Community regime in which all producers in the Community could grow what they liked while Britain kept the board and the acreage quotas, would that be free and fair trade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that my intention was to raise a series of questions. It is for the Opposition to raise questions and for the Government to answer them. I hope that the Government will answer these questions. There is a complicated on-going debate. One can see short-term benefits in the Government's immediate aims, but what will happen in the longer term? Can the Minister provide for what might happen in 10 years' time? Questions such as these must be thoroughly considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was particularly interested to read the Potato Marketing Board's response to three criticisms which it felt were unjustly raised against it. First
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the PMB and the Potato Marketing Scheme restrict the growing of potatoes",</p></blockquote>
secondly,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0113">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>193</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"That the Potato Marketing Scheme is responsible for the growth in imports of processed potatoes",</p></blockquote>
and, thirdly,
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the Scheme is responsible for the fall in exports, and rise in imports, of seed potatoes."</p></blockquote>
Those are important points and I hope that the Minister will give detailed clarification about some of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important industry is monitoring our considerations. It has an impact on employment and, possibly, on the balance of trade. It also has an important impact on the majority of consumers. I am quoting legitimate sources and, without trying to put the Minister on the spot, I hope that my questions are answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nottinghamshire is a great potato-growing area in terms of quality and amount. It is the potato crisping kingdom of the world and I know that local processors and producers will be interested in some of the Minister's remarks. He made it clear today and on Second Reading that the heart of the argument is his belief that the potato marketing scheme cannot make the necessary changes to cope with the evolving market. That argument is different from that advanced when the Bill was originally presented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be clear. There are two strands of argument. The first is that, in the event of a Community regime, which is overwhelmingly likely to be lightweight, the British system would be incompatible, irrespective of its merits. The second strand is whether the British scheme is delivering benefits that are in the national interest. One needs to keep the two separate, although they meet in places. We need to reflect on whether the latter is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to hearing what the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has to say later this morning. There is a view in the potato industry that a lightweight scheme would not necessarily be incompatible with the potato marketing scheme. That is still subject to a great deal of discussion. Let me put it in stronger terms: there is a view among British producers that the Minister is not batting for Britain; that he has given up the fight.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I put to the hon. Member the straight question: does he think that it would be to the advantage of Britain if every other country in the EC could produce as many potatoes as they liked, without any system of restraint, while we had a lightweight regime which restrained the amount of potatoes that we could produce? Does he think that that would be batting for Britain? If he does, it would be curious if we applied that concept to any other product known to mankind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is very clear to me that potato producers want Ministers who listen to them and argue their case strenuously. Some in the industry believe that that is not happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not answered my question. Leaving aside potatoes, would the hon. Gentleman agree to a regime which meant that every country in Europe could produce as many motor cars or carrots as they wished, while Britain's production of motor cars or carrots was restricted? If he honestly believes that that would be good for Britain, it is a curious piece of economics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman can tell us in his promised speech, to which we are looking
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>194</span>
forward, how the free market operates across Europe. Several of us have information which suggests that in France, Spain, Portugal and other Community countries, Governments pay substantial amounts of money to enable producers to grow and to survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, in the future, the potato marketing scheme will not depend on Government money. The Minister has made clear that the drive for change has come from the changing market, rather than from a desire for change in the Community. There are arguments to be fought and won.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed the outcome of a poll of producers and the fact that producers have not voted overwhelmingly for the continuation of the potato marketing scheme. As I understand the scheme, producers had the opportunity for a poll to get rid of the scheme if they did not want it—they never took that opportunity. I have not seen the poll about which the Minister of State was talking, but if I had more than 50 per cent. of people voting for me, I would be an extremely happy man. We shall see what happens later this week in Newbury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As someone who commanded 59 per cent. of the vote in my constituency, it is hardly surprising that people who belong to the scheme have voted in favour of it. The scheme exists to allow them to grow potatoes at a price which is above what they would otherwise receive; it is designed to restrict the acreage and to make it difficult for others to come into the scheme; and it penalises those who might operate without the scheme. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that, judging their own interest—the only interest that they are required to judge—those people have voted in favour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that potato processors need a playing field in which they can operate sensitively and sensibly. We are not talking about tinpot garden exercises but about multi-million pound investments. Tony Strawson, who lives in my constituency and who is the largest potato producer for crisping purposes has spent millions of pounds on extending his season, on storage, developing new potatoes and working closely with the processors so that he can provide the material that the processors and, ultimately, the consumers want. It has cost him a great deal of money and I do not believe that he would have made that investment had not there been—in his view—stability in the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed a poll. Let me tell the Minister that a poll of potato producers in Nottinghamshire would produce an absolutely overwhelming result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that crisping is a unique sector of the market, because between 70 and 80 per cent. of it is contracted? Therefore, it would make no difference to his constitutent whether or not the potato marketing scheme existed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that producers want to produce potatoes that people will buy. The argument this morning has been driven by one section of the potato industry—the processors who produce for chipping. The Minister has made it clear that that is his drive and the reason why he wants change. He said earlier that that was because of the amount of exports from abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry wants to be flexible in a marketplace where it feels there is at least some stability. I remind the Minister of initiatives that have been taken in the industry
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0114">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>195</span>
to try and meet the challenge and make the change as we would put it. It is clear that the Potato Marketing Board has introduced new measures. Since 1989–90, imports of frozen and chilled chips have declined from 312,000 tonnes to below 300,000 tonnes in 1990–91, while in 1991–92, the figure was slightly higher at 302,000 tonnes. Imports have fallen because the Potato Marketing Board has developed, as a result of discussions in the industry, a new special basic area scheme for chip potato growers with forward contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important for us to consider Britain as separate from the rest of Europe because of the tariff on transport, to which we have already referred. In Britain, substantive discussions take place through the joint consultative council about the amount and type of potatoes grown. Through those discussions, the PMB introduced new schemes to meet processors' needs. Producers want the industry to survive. Millions of pounds have been put into new equipment and plant. But for the industry to survive, producers need stability. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what happened in Sweden, where its potato marketing board was wound up two years ago. I understand that Swedish producers, processors and consumers would like to see the return of some of its functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill's provisions for potatoes are a jump in the dark. We are told that the scheme does not work because it cannot make the necessary changes. We are told that it may be necessary to change the scheme because of European requirements. Let us hear about those European requirements and let us have an assurance from the Minister that he will consider carefully a European lightweight scheme that allows national interests—subsidiarity, as it is called—to operate beneath it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that a change is a jump in the dark. Would he agree that all change means moving away from certainties to something that is less certain? We must agree on that. Otherwise, we are simply not being logical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key is—this also answers the point raised by the hon. Member for North Cornwall—that, in our proposals, we are entrusting the successor arrangements to the Potato Marketing Board. That body will suggest what the successor regime should be. Therefore, the Potato Marketing Board will throw some illumination on that jump in the dark. The constituent of the hon. Member for Sherwood was producing specifically for a market, but the Potato Marketing Board does not market anything. That producer would certainly survive and his business may grow under a successor regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All change brings about some uncertainty, but some of us believe in planning for change by looking to the future and taking steps to reach our objectives. The Bill is the free market writ large. Change will happen, and it will happen quickly because the Bill makes clear that, when the Minister is of the opinion, when it is expedient, and when it is in the public interest—all value words—then, the board will have only 12 months left in which to operate. That is not planning for change, but jumping off a cliff edge. Producers have a right to be able to safeguard their investments, to look to the future and to have time to make those changes. I am interested that the word
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>196</span>
"expedient" remains in the Bill and is modified in a later subsection. Some of us wonder what is expedient and what is in the public interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made it clear that the Bill has been driven mainly by processors. In his view, acreage and jobs are being exported. Holland has surplus processing capacity because of the way in which its processing industry has changed in recent years. Plainly, some processors are prepared to invest in this country. That is to be supported and it is to be hoped that processors and producers will work together, but, plainly, processors have the ear of the Minister. Earlier, the Minister was asked to explain some of those links. Some of us would be most interested to see McCain's annual report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have McCain's annual report, but I have a press statement issued by McCain Foods in response to claims made by Mr. Henry McCubbin. It is about political contributions to the Conservative party; that is what the hon. Gentleman is getting at. As allegations have been made, perhaps I may put on the record, for the sake of fairness, what McCain Foods said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it lengthy? The Minister is making an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only two paragraphs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. This is not the occasion, on the back of an amendment that we tabled on the need to block unilateral action by the Government, to raise such a matter. That is another issue that the Minister can perhaps raise later, if he wishes, but not now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. Members of the Opposition raised the matter under their amendment and they thought that it was in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am anxious to preserve the good humour that exists, or that had existed until I arrived this morning—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> I promise that, either way, I do not care. However, it would help if interventions were shorter and to one point or, if they are to be multiple and complex, if they could be kept for answer at the end of a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the Minister make the point that I think he was going to make about the relationship between McCain Foods and the Conservative party. That company's annual report is due to be released. But previous annual reports—I think that this is true and the Minister may confirm it—show that in 1990 McCain Foods made a political donation of £3,500 to the Conservative party and that in 1991 it donated £5,500.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It pales into insignificance compared with the amounts that have come from abroad. It is important to note that, unlike many companies, its donation has increased rather than decreased. One thing that McCain—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am enjoying this free-ranging debate and should like to get to the root of the problem. However, the issue of political contributions strays a little wide of the subject of seed potatoes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I make this final point, Mr. Cook. It is believed in the industry that the Bill is driven by the processors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0115">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>197</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman speaks of processors as an amorphous group. However, the essence of the Bill relates to thousands of jobs in the processing industry that are currently being lost to Holland, and to an improvement in the balance of payments, which the country and, I thought, the Labour party wanted to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill's provisions would also put at risk some producers. It is important to note the decline in the number of potato producers in this country over recent years to between 130,000 and 140,000. Those producers are more efficient and more in touch with the market than they have ever been in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are about 16,000 registered potato producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tipping</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right. I am reading from the wrong set of figures. It is clear, however, that producers are becoming increasingly efficient and increasingly in touch with the market. I believe that there is a strong view in the industry that, given a little more time, that trend would continue. At present, the Bill represents a leap in the dark for producers. They will not continue the efficiency and the investment that they have worked so hard to ensure over the past five to 10 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate, so far, has concentrated rightly on how the market relates to the processing industry. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood has said, the pressure for change has come from that sector. However, as the Minister admitted in his remarks, processing accounts for only one third of production. The remaining two thirds of British production is accounted for by fresh potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent the premier county in Wales, which is renowned for its early potato production. First, however, I shall make a few comments on the issue of the processors and the pressure for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we examine all the information that we have received from the PMB and from various processors, we notice that many comments have been made about the apparent success of the Dutch in exporting processed products to the British market. Not much comment is made about Dutch success in the rest of Europe. We are told by processors that, because they cannot get enough acreage in Britain and because our prices are too high, we must suffer significant imports from Holland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By examining those prices, we can find an interesting explanation. Although Britain's prices as quoted in the PMB document are for the past five years certainly higher on average than Dutch prices—which would support the processors' reason for Dutch imports—the German prices ex-farm are lower than Dutch prices. The same is true for Belgium and France. However, the Dutch are also penetrating those markets significantly, even though the ex-farm prices of French, German and Belgian potatoes are invariably much lower than Dutch prices. Perhaps that is not solely to do with the price of the produce ex-farm. I think that only 10 per cent. of the price of the finished product is accounted for in raw potato prices. Even if there is a difference, it does not account for much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that the Dutch jumped the rest of the European market, especially when it came to getting into chilled potato products such as the chilled chip. They were well ahead in that market. They made significant
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>198</span>
investments in their plant and machinery. That is why they can penetrate British markets and the rest of the European market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman hazard a guess why the Dutch could "jump the rest of the European market" when the British could not? Is not it about time that we showed that we could beat the Dutch at all these games, given that we produce the best potatoes in the world? I am quoting from articles and letters referred to by Opposition Members. We have the best varieties, and run the industry more professionally, cleverly and better. Why did we not jump the European market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that the processing sector is not as efficient, well-organised and well-managed as the producer sector. There is no reason why British processors should not have jumped the European market. Perhaps they did not because of interest rates in the 1980s. There might be other reasons why the necessary investment was made not in this country but in Holland. The statistics suggest that it had nothing to do with the price of potatoes in Britain or Holland and that there were other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To respond to the hon. Member for Hendon, South, who commented on jobs being lost in Britain as opposed to in Holland, my understanding is that because of recent events in Holland, significant numbers of jobs are being lost there. At least two major producers tell us that they are investing heavily in their British plants. We seem to hear different stories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The joint consultative council has been established during the past three years. Every year, it reaches an agreement with, presumably, all parties—including the Consumers Association—which are willing to accept the target acreage. One wonders why the processors constantly argue for an increase in acreage. They are represented at the JCC so surely if their real demand was for more acreage and produce from Britain, the JCC would constantly demand more and more acreage. It would visit farmers—knock on their doors or telephone them—and give them nice glossy brochures about new and extra contracts. My information is that that is not happening. It appears that the processors want not a significant increase in production but a significant reduction in price. They are perfectly happy with the present level of production. If they are not, why are they not using the vehicle of the JCC to put forward their arguments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, that is not what they say. All the major processors, and some of the smaller ones, are on record as saying that they would like to have more procurement in the United Kingdom but cannot secure it because of the restraints of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the JCC is of course, a joint consultative committee. The processors do not have the means to dictate the quantities sown. That must be done by agreement. In the framework of a quota, there is a limit to which the margins can be pushed. The processors' view is that the system does not work in the national interest at the moment in so far as we are exporting the acreage. I am not necessarily saying that the case is absolutely right or wrong, but it is a case to examine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The JCC was set up by the Government three years ago so that all interested parties in the potato industry had an opportunity to state their case. Members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0116">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>199</span>
of the JCC are not telling me that the processors are demanding more and more acreage. That is a matter of fact and what I have been told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that the argument is led by the processors who claim that because of the so-called restrictive nature of the PMB and the area target, they are unable to compete with the Dutch. Yet they are going ahead with significant investments in their own plants. I suggest to the Ministers that the real issue is about tonnage, not price. They would like a free market to be established in which the problems of glut and shortage, which are especially relevant to agricultural products, work against the producer rather than the processor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In earlier debates we referred to the milk marketing boards that were created in the 1930s to cope with the problems of glut and shortage. When there was a glut, small producers disappeared. When the need for milk became apparent, the market demand could not be satisfied. That is the fear of growers in Pembrokeshire. If the target area is removed and the PMB abolished, what happened last year will happen again. The minimum guaranteed price last year cost the taxpayer little because the burden fell on the producers through their levy. We accept the proposal in the Bill to end the Government's contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall compare early potato production in Pembrokeshire in 1991 with production in 1992. In 1991, just over 1,500 hectares were picked. In 1992, that fell to just under 1,300 hectares. In 1991, more than 200 hectares were planted than in 1992 and production was 34,340 tonnes. In 1992, production dropped by only 2,000 tonnes to 32,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Pembrokeshire farmers experienced the problems of glut and shortage. The value of the 34,340 tonnes produced in 1991 was £6,018,000. In 1992, with less than only 2,000 fewer tonnes produced, the value had fallen to £3,111,000—almost half what the producers achieved in the previous year. That happened with the board in existence. If a guaranteed minimum price had not been set and agreed by the board, supported by the levy payers, the value would have fallen further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such fluctuations cannot be eradicated because the product is dependent on the weather in this country and elsewhere. The early potato market is highly competitive. Farmers have to compete with Cypriot, Egyptian, Moroccan and Spanish potatoes and, towards the end of the season, the Pembrokeshire farmers have to compete with the rest of Great Britain. All those elements mean that it is essential that there is an organisation to bring stability to the fresh potato market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Pembrokeshire we have an organisation called Puffin Potatoes, which is the major marketing arm of the premier growers. Of the 3,600 acres that grow new potatoes in that area, Puffin growers account for 1,200 acres, which is about one third of the acreage. As a result of the problems that they faced, the income of the organisation was slashed from £2 million in 1991 to £1·2 million in 1992. It is clear that if the PMB and the potato marketing scheme are abolished because of the vagaries of the market and because of the fact that growers will not be guaranteed a price, the economics of the industry in Pembrokeshire will need to be reviewed.

I should like to reiterate what my hon. Friends have said. The Government are taking an enormous leap in the dark. The early potato industry pumps millions of pounds into the Pembrokeshire economy. For two months of the year, it provides a significant number of casual jobs, which are essential in an area of high unemployment such as Pembrokeshire and which bring some relief to people on low incomes or who are unemployed. The Government are threatening another blow to the rural economy. Annually, farmers make significant investments amounting to approximately £1,200 per acre. They have to upgrade their equipment, renew their irrigation and potato-picking equipment and so on. All that will be under threat if we unilaterally abolish the PMB. It is unfortunate that the debate has again concentrated on one third of potato production and not on the important two thirds of fresh potato production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for arriving 15 minutes late for this morning's sitting. I fully intended to be here on time having left home at 6 am, but the Civil Aviation Authority ensured that I spent 45 minutes revolving in small circles over Amersham, which is appropriate preparation for the deliberations of the Committee, except that, so far, we have not had much debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You, Mr. Cook, have properly said that you are prepared to let the debate on amendment No. 65 range widely and almost to treat it as a clause stand part debate. One might have expected members of the Committee to express their views now that we have reached what is probably the most controversial part of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East commented several times on the fact that we have all received many representations from people in all parts of the industry, especially producers. I should have thought that at least as many Conservative members of the Committee represent potato producers as do Opposition Members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am certainly familiar with the situation in my constituency, having seen plenty of activity on the land in East Lothian in the past three days. In the good weather, many potatoes are being planted. I wonder whether as many potatoes will be planted in that part of the world in future if we take the leap in the dark that the Government have proposed, despite the fact that there is no specific requirement to do so under EC rules. I understand that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food intends to take part in the debate in light of what has recently been discussed in the Council. It would be interesting if he could explain to the Committee to what extent the EC is putting pressure on the Government to introduce this enabling Bill to destroy the potato marketing scheme. We have been advised that nothing of the sort is necessary, so perhaps the Minister will tell us what he is up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we moved from part I of the Bill to part II we were struck by the fundamental difference in the regimes that will apply to the two key agricultural sectors for milk and potatoes. The Government are getting rid of the milk marketing board but there will still be controls on production under the milk quota scheme, as required by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0117">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
the European Community. EC regulations require us to apply a rigid, effective and tight quota scheme for the production of milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Britain, the quota scheme regulates the production of potatoes. Processors and consumers are fully consulted and the scheme works in the interests of all concerned. But if the Government have their way, they will get rid of that and all the other functions that the PMB carries out efficiently and effectively. It is incumbent on Ministers to explain why. It is a radical step to dismantle a system that has worked very efficiently for many years in the interests of producers, processors and consumers. Before enacting such legislation, the Government should be able to persuade Parliament objectively and subjectively that that is desirable or necessary. That has yet to be done, but the Minister must do so if he wants to be taken seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said several times, I have been advised by potato producers in my constituency and by people in other parts of the potato trade in Scotland that the present system works well. How on earth has the powerful and influential Potato Processors Association, which has 26 members, managed to wield so much influence and to apply so much pressure on the Government? It cannot be its £3,000 contribution to the Tory party. Even the Minister does not come that cheap; surely he would not introduce primary legislation for just £3,000. Not since Judas Iscariot has a decision been as cheap as that and we need an explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system is working well in the interests of all concerned. A new processor in my part of the world started working with potatoes and produced a new product. There was obviously going to be a requirement for a larger quantity of a specific grade of potatoes to be supplied to that processor during the following year. Instead of wittering and whingeing to the Government that the PMB should go because it would be difficult to obtain the necessary potatoes, it told the PMB that it would need those potatoes. That presented no difficulties and the PMB told farmers in the area that more of those potatoes would be required and asked whether they wanted an increase in their basic acreage to fulfil that need. It is rubbish for Ministers to say that the scheme is being operated restrictively. How could it be in the interests of producers, the board, the National Farmers Union or anyone else to prevent farmers from producing potatoes for a specific market? That would be nonsense and it has never happened. It cannot be sensible for the Potato Processors Association or anyone else to suggest otherwise. Why does that association want the scheme to be dismantled now? I can only assume that it wants potatoes to be even cheaper than the £10 a tonne at which they are available this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Well, good luck to it. That would be disastrous for producers and processors. There have been a few mixed metaphors in this Committee, so let us have another one: they would burn their own seed corn if they agreed to that. Let us suppose that the industry's ability efficiently to produce high quality potatoes was destroyed. What would potato processors do the following year if they undermined the industry on which they depend for their raw material?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished that no Conservative Member has yet risen to explain the enthusiasm for this radical change. I presume that several Conservative Members have producer, processor and certainly retailing interests in potatoes in their constituencies. I should be fascinated to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
know whether producers anywhere are wildly enthusiastic about such a free-for-all. My hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) was right to highlight the risk to producers in areas like his. If we lose such regulation and the ability to share out potato production throughout the country, it would cause uncertainty and major fluctuations in various parts of the industry. Moreover, it would cause particular problems in peripheral areas—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must remind the Committee that it is not in order to read newspapers in the Committee Room, either overtly or covertly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there are no covert newspaper readers in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that if the Potato Marketing Board loses its ability to structure the industry in the interests of producers throughout the country there might be an increase in large-scale production in areas near processors. However, that would be very bad news for producers in Scotland, Pembrokeshire, other parts of Wales and the north and south-west of England, who are further removed from the market. Such free-marketeering is not in the long-term interests of anyone involved in a commodity such as potatoes. It is risky. It could do great long-term damage to an important industry and it may affect jobs in many of our constituencies. I should be fascinated to learn how the Minister justifies his proposals. It is the duty of both sides of the Committee properly to scrutinise the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be noticeable from the debate today that Ministers feel vulnerable on this issue. I could not count the number of interventions that Ministers made in the speeches of my hon. Friends, but their repeated interventions suggest a degree of sensitivity on this issue. During our debate on the amendment, there have been more interventions by Ministers than on all the other debates so far—such is their concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened on the matter of political donations because I think that it should be dealt with by the Minister when he replies to the debate. I am sure that he will do so. We should not, however, be distracted by that issue while Opposition Back-Bench Members are debating other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is extremely narrow. Were amendments Nos. 65, 66 and 67 to be agreed to by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0118">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
Committee, they would have the effect of blocking the use of the Bill's provisions as the means by which the Government could wind up the potato marketing scheme. The amendments endeavour to prevent the Government from taking a unilateral British decision to wind up the scheme, instead of being required by the European Community to wind up the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our view is simple: should Europe decide wisely or unwisely that the scheme must go, so be it. I am sure that my hon. Friends and lobbies outside will argue for a revision of the scheme or a compromise to provide some form of protection for potato producers in the United Kingdom. We shall have to deal fully with that issue at a later stage, but we may be able to deal with it to some extent this afternoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should Ministers acting for the British Government decide that unilaterally they have the right to impose a free market for potato production on the United Kingdom? Why should they have the right to impose it on this country in conditions where there may be no regime in the rest of Europe? The implication is that Ministers are prepared to accept a system that provides no level playing field in Europe for potato supply. In my view, Ministers should not act unilaterally without being absolutely assured about the potato regimes that already exist in Europe in national states as light regimes. All the countries that I am about to mention already have light regimes. By the use of phrases such as
	<br><blockquote><p>"If Ministers certify that they are of the opinion"</p></blockquote>
or
	<br><blockquote><p>"If it appears to the Ministers"</p></blockquote>
in clause 22, Ministers are saying that they are prepared to accept and impose a free market on the United Kingdom, irrespective of what happens in the rest of Europe and irrespective of any requirements that may arise from regulations agreed in the Council of Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In arguing for the amendment, I have to prove only that were the British regime to be removed there would no longer be a level playing field in Europe regarding availability of state aids. Those state aids may take the form of the British scheme, which to some extent is a state aid. State aids are about money and the use of legislation, and legislation alone can be interpreted as a state aid. I think that article 93 deals with these matters, but if I am wrong perhaps someone could correct me. We have to prove only that there will be no level playing field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my evidence, I give the results of the research that we have conducted. Ministers seem most reluctant to tell us about state aids in Europe. Indeed, questions have even been asked in the European Parliament by Conservative Members of that Parliament about state aids that are made available in other countries which, in my view, act perhaps not as effectively but in the same way as the Potato Marketing Board's scheme in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Mr. Peter Crampton sent a fax to a Mr. Robin Barker, a producer in Lincolnshire, which stated that he had
	<br><blockquote><p>"talked to European Commission officials yesterday in Brussels and he was told—there is an inventory of state aids to the agricultural sector. After 1974 Member States (MS) agreed to send such details to the Commission—each MS gets a copy of the inventory every year—the MS agreed that it was not for publication".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
Peter Crampton's request was approximately the 160th for information on state aids paid by nation states in Europe to the potato sector. In the European Parliament, Mr. Peter Crampton asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Does the Commission have any statistics on the amount of national aid paid to farmers in each Member State?"</p></blockquote>
The reply was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Statistical Office does not hold itemized data on national aid paid to farmers. However, data on the total amounts—Community and national aid—are available in the economic accounts for agriculture (since it is not possible to differentiate in those accounts between the two types of aid). An inventory of state aid to the agricultural sector as a whole is maintained with the cooperation of Member States, later amended. However, Member States have not submitted this data to the Commission with a view to publication."</p></blockquote>
I also have an answer from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland to the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh), who asked about state aid. The reply was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Information about EC member state intervention in the potato market is not formally obtained by my Department.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We are aware that certain other member states—for example, France, Italy, Spain and Portugal—may operate ad hoc intervention and other support measures in times of over-supply. In addition, the Netherlands operate a seed support scheme."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 March 1993, Vol. 220, c. 	<i>718.</i>]</p></blockquote>
What is emerging from those answers is that we are prepared to remove, unilaterally, our schemes which protect potato producers to some extent, but that when it comes to other countries in the European Community, and all the aid arrangements that they have, be it intervention funds, buying up, direct subsidies, labour subsidies or social security payments, which I shall deal with in a moment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be surprised. I want him to stay in Committee and hear the rest of the debate. The problem with Ministers is that they have not been listening to the debate going on outside in the country and have become obsessed with "stability", on which I could speak for an hour. I am sure that the Minister would be interested to hear what we have to say on stability. Ministers have not understood the real nature of the scheme and its worth to the British potato producer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I expressed surprise because the hon. Gentleman is not making the distinction between state aids, which help people to sell potatoes, and a system which puts the British potato producer, processor and manufacturer at a disadvantage when competing with other countries. If the hon. Gentleman does not recognise that, it is not because he is not listening but because he does not understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the Minister who draws that distinction. Following through the effects of state aids in Europe instead of those of the Potato Marketing Board scheme in the United Kingdom, while they may not affect the supply and price of potatoes to the same extent as happens in the United Kingdom, the effect is the same in so far as both arrangements—European or United Kingdom—protect potato producers and help them to survive in what is believed to be a free market. If the potato regime is taken away from the United Kingdom and the lightweight regimes in European countries are allowed to remain, British potato producers will be placed at a competitive disadvantage.

To pick out one subsidy, Denmark paid £1 million in 1990 to promote sales, research, quality control and disease protection. In tonnage terms, that is equivalent to paying £6 million in the United Kingdom because Denmark produces one sixth of the amount of potatoes that we produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We identified four schemes in Italy funded by an organisation called AIMA. In 1992–93, AIMA planned to take 60,000 tonnes of potatoes off the market to turn them into alcohol. It was paying £124 per tonne, of which the growers received £74. It is—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Ministers may laugh, but those subsidies are paid to potato producers in other parts of Europe and are not available in the United Kingdom. In my view, we have a better arrangement. Our scheme is an alternative to the principles of intervention that exist in other European countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additionally, producer organisations in Italy received £9 per tonne and the co-ops received £6 per tonne in 1992–93. Processors complained that the subsidy was not enough so they received an additional subsidy. I hesitate because I understand that a British company linked with an Italian processor was a recipient of those subsidies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 27 January 1992, £26 million of aid was paid to potato growers in Italy. On 31 August 1992, a special subsidy of 7p per kilo was paid for new potatoes. We have no gross figure of the cost to the taxpayer. On 15 October 1992, a national programme for private storage of potatoes cost the Italian taxpayer £7·5 million. In one year, we estimate that the Italian Government paid £50 million into the Italian potato sector. I should have thought that Ministers, when deciding to wind up the potato marketing scheme, would have considered the fact that the Italians are paying such a subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
France has several national intervention schemes. In July 1992, £7 million was paid to early growers. In October 1992, £4 million was paid to main crop growers, and in December 1992, they received an extra £2 million. Last year was a bad year but I understand that whenever there is a surplus the French authorities are prepared to intervene in the market to help their potato producers. Last year, they spent £13 million. What was the cost to the taxpayer in the United Kingdom? Was it £1·5 million?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also understand that several other types of subsidy are paid to enable potato growers in France to spread out their social security payments. Local government departments have been ordered to give priority loans because potato growers have been directly disadvantaged by common agricultural policy reforms. Producers of potatoes will receive consolidation loans repayable over seven years at a rate of 8 per cent. That has long-term implications. It is cheap money over seven years at the same time that the Government are considering phasing out the potato marketing scheme. A subsidy is being paid to enable regular potato growers to remain in business when their business viability is clearly threatened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Traders will also benefit from loans being made available at preferential rates. We cannot put a cost on that package, but we know that France produces a similar quantity of potatoes as the United Kingdom. France has its means of protecting the market and it will not give up its means of protecting the market as easily as the United Kingdom Government are prepared to give up their means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Spain, £7 million was paid in loans for storage at preferential rates of 7·9 per cent. for co-operatives and 8·9 per cent. for other individuals acting as producers. When
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
the EC blocked a request by the Spanish Government to stop imports, that Government imposed a system under which importers had to deposit a sum equal to the value of any imports and bring in the appropriate quantity in five days. Repayment of the deposit may be delayed for up to 12 months, so that system made importing expensive. That takes me back to the old import deposit scheme on general trade, which existed during the late 1960s, and which had the effect of impeding imports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Portuguese Goverment have introduced low interest loans for storage. Last autumn, they introduced a £32 a tonne export subsidy. They have also introduced a £20 a tonne subsidy for certain potato crops that are bought through co-operatives from three regions in Spain, which is paid by an intervention and guarantee body for potatoes. They have a structured arrangement for paying subsidies to the industry. They have also set a minimum import price of £75 a tonne for eating potatoes. So they, too, have direct import controls.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Luxembourg, a subsidy was paid in 1991 to all farmers who suffered serious damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Holland—a country so often quoted—offers a starch subsidy, a farmer loan guarantee fund, a special rent subsidy on land used for potato production, a welfare payment system and concessional export credits guarantee terms. Under the starch regime, processors pay a minimum of £33 a tonne to the farmer while the processor receives the intervention price for the starch product. The loan guarantee scheme is similar to that which existed in the United Kingdom some years ago. Under the rent subsidy scheme, "polders"—pieces of land that have been reclaimed from the sea, and which are owned by the Government—are rented to farmers and the rents adjusted according to the success of farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have also made special social security arrangements, which Ministers should consider. Members of the Landbouwschap agriculture board are worried about the increase in the number of growers with financial problems; that number has increased by 30 per cent. to 50 per cent. during the past 12 months. Farmers are reluctant to ask for help, which is obscuring the real situation. In addition, income from other sources tends to mask poor results on the farm. The Landbouwschap has decided not to give any form of aid to growers, but to encourage them to discuss their problems with their banks. Even so, the number of farmers who have applied for state assistance—Bijstand—as a last resort has increased by 61 per cent. The worst problems are experienced by those working in the glasshouse, mushroom and field vegetable sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to prove to the Committee that, throughout Europe, there is a subsidy regime, which will remain in the event that Europe does not take a decision on those matters. Yet, if Europe does not take a decision on those matters, the British Government are prepared, in clause 22, to wind up the British potato marketing scheme. They have no right to act unilaterally and put our farmers at risk when the subsidies that I have outlined are available elsewhere in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Ireland, in the Donegal area, which is badly affected, the Government have promised £1 million this year. Given that its crop is one eleventh of the size of the United Kingdom crop, that is the equivalent of £12 million paid to producers in the United Kingdom. Ireland is another

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>207</span>
country that has its own regime, which, no doubt, will remain if the EC does not reach a decision, and will remain if the British Government choose the unilateral route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My researchers and I have identified only some of the schemes that are available nationally. There are many more and it is the reluctance of Ministers of other Governments and officials in the Commission to publish information on state aid which leads me to believe that if we abolish our scheme unilaterally, there will not be a level playing field in Europe and British potato producers will suffer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we should congratulate the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) on revealing why it would be sensible to have the lightest of lightweight regimes to ensure a level playing field throughout Europe. The overwhelmingly likely result of the negotiations in Luxembourg and Brussels is that a lightweight regime will be designed to ensure such a level playing field. That will not provide a level playing field for Britain however, because we have the significant advantage of the channel. It costs an extra £35 a tonne to import potatoes into this country and, happily, the Commission has not yet discovered a way in which to overcome that cost. Whatever we do, that will remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington was wide of the mark in trying to suggest that his comments were germane. He could not have all the evidence to hand because, in the absence of a regime, there is no requirement on Governments in Europe to provide to the Commission the sort of information that they must provide on all the segments which are subject to a regime. There is much to be said for a lightweight regime, so long as it does not develop into a regime with all the paraphernalia of intervention and so on, which we do not want in the United Kingdom. My judgment is that we shall reach such an agreement, but that that is not certain because we have not seen the total package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was worried at one moment because I thought that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) was going to refer to a tricky and delicate subject—the potato producers in my constituency. I am very biased on the subject because I want them to have a business in four years when the next election is due. I want them to have a business in eight or nine years when the following election is due. My concern is that all the speech of the hon. Member for Workington who was, as always, searching for a plot, he failed to point out that the systems in the rest of Europe enable the potato producers to sell more potatoes. The system in Britain is specifically designed to restrict the number of potatoes which producers can sell. If we continue in the same way, that growing area of the market in which we are not well served by the protection of £35 a tonne will suffer and decline because the tendency will be for investment to take place outside the country and, more importantly, there will be less opportunity for British producers to grow more potatoes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the hon. Gentleman gave me far less time in which to respond than I understood that he would give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman complained that I intervened often, but I did so because there was a serious lack of hon. Members who were prepared to face up to the real issue. If the word "potato" were removed from the argument and "cauliflower" or "carrots" were substituted, would it be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
credible to have a system in Britain—a country which is naturally designed for the production of carrots—which said to its producers, "Look here lads, we shall restrain your production of carrots to keep the price at a level which you think might be suitable, but we're in a single market, so everyone else can produce as many carrots as they like"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the most peculiar argument of the hon. Member for East Lothian who owns so much of the Borders. How much I say to the hon. Gentleman depends on which pose he is adopting at the time. The reason for the different treatment of the MMB and PMB is that the MMB is concerned with the marketing of milk and the PMB is not involved in marketing. The PMB organises the terms within which other people trade, so it does not have the same structure as the MMB. Having a quota system throughout the single market is quite different from having such a system in one part of the market. If the hon. Gentleman cannot see that the issues faced by the PMB are different from those faced by the MMB, he misses the point. There is a single market throughout Europe which is restricted by the same quota system, but the single market in potatoes is restricted by a unilateral system called the British potato marketing system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Europe does not reach a decision and the Minister acts unilaterally, will he subsidise British potato producers on the same basis as the French, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and Italians?

We believe that we shall have to act within the Community. I do not want to hide behind the Community. I suggest to the Committee that it is better to have a system that promotes British potatoes rather than restricts them. If the Community does not reach agreement and it is to the benefit of British producers to make the change, it is right for the Government to have the power to make that change.
