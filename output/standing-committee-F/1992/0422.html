DETERMINATION OF APPLICATIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [20 April]:</i> No. 84, in page 3, line 11, to leave out the word "and, and insert the words—
<br><blockquote><p>"(iii) that the scheme provides that the ownership and management of the milk marketing activities of the board shall be separate from the ownership and management of its milk processing activities, and".—[<i>Mr. Peter Atkinson.</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to see you, Mr. Hill, and other members of the Committee looking bright eyed and bushy tailed this morning after a good night's work supporting the further development of the European Community.<br><br>
I must confess that I have a couple of minor problems about amendment No. 84, which was moved by the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson). First, the Committee adjourned at one o'clock on Tuesday, I had begun a sentence with the memorable words "It is"—or so it says in <i>Hansard.</i> I then made the fatal error of not writing a note of what I was going to say. I confess that I have forgotten, so that unfinished sentence will have to remain on the record as one of those tantalising parliamentary mysteries.<br><br>
My second problem is that not only am I here in Committee Room 9 but, as the records of the House will show—I am simultaneously in the Select Committee on Defence in Room 16 examining Ministery of Defence officials on the SA 80 service rifle. It is one of those quaint parliamentary miracles that hon. Members can be in two places at the same time. It means that, not having to choose to put guns before butter, I can have both at once. I hope that you, Mr. Hill, and members of the Committee will forgive me if I go up and down the corridor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman could use the same speech!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Watch it: there are bayonets and all sorts of things along there!<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hexham has the temerity to question the motives of the Scottish milk marketing board, which was particularly careless given that the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch) is sitting directly behind him and the Minister, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir Hector Munro), and I are on the Committee.<br><br>
We have heard a little about Milk Marque—which sounds wonderfully communautaire—and its commercial partner, Dairy Crest, under the new system south
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
of the border. So perhaps I can now introduce the Committee to Scottish Milk and Scottish Pride. I shall leave the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside to complete the picture with the plans for the Aberdeen and District board and the North of Scotland board, which are a bit closer to his territory.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hexham said on Tuesday that he wanted Scottish Milk to be totally detached from Scottish Pride, as the Scottish milk marketing board proposes, on instructions from the Government, the Office of Fan-Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But that is not good enough for the hon. Member for Hexham and whoever is advising him on these matters. He is not satisfied with what he describes as "Chinese walls" between Scottish Milk and Scottish Pride; he wants the Berlin wall as well, right down the middle of the Scottish MMB office in Paisley.<br><br>
My instinct has always been to support the case for a strong, integrated cooperative to continue the valuable work of the Scottish milk marketing board north of the border as a successor body if the Government insist on dismantling the SMMB's existing structure. There is a lot to be said for keeping the proven and successful vertically-integrated operation together in Scotland. However, I have to acknowledge that the Scottish Dairy Trade Federation and Mr. Wiseman, for whom I hold no particular brief, obviously have a point when they complain about having to compete in the retail marketplace with a monopoly supplier of wholesale milk, especially in the context of the quota restrictions on milk production. I acknowledged on Second Reading that something had to be done about that problem and we are now discussing whether it has been approached in the right way.<br><br>
The point about disengaging the new producer cooperative from the commercial arm, Scottish Pride, has been fully conceded by the Scottish milk marketing board. There will be a genuine, arm's length, separation between the producer cooperative, Scottish Milk, and the processing and retail operation, Scottish Pride. However, the hon. Member for Hexham—or whoever is prompting him—may not yet be satisfied. On Tuesday, he quibbled about whether any directors would sit on both boards and he suggested that shares in Scottish Pride should be traded on the stock exchange.<br><br>
It would be useful if the Committee could get the subject into proportion. The Scottish milk marketing board is a pint-sized operation compared with Dan Dare's set-up south of the border. The milk marketing board for England and Wales is ten times the size of the Scottish board. The SMMB has only 1,604 full-time employees—242 of whom are in the milk marketing division, 132 in the livestock services division, and 1,230 who work for the various divisions of Scottish Pride. There is one big dairy operation in Helen street, Govan, and four smaller creameries at Kirkcudbright, Galloway, Campbelltown and Lochmaben—which is in the constituency of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland who may contribute to this debate—and two very small island cheese-making creameries on Bute and Arran. That is it. The Scottish milk marketing board is very successful and has done a great job of investing, developing new products and expanding the market at home and abroad by exporting, not only to England but to other countries. However, it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
cannot be described as a monstrous monopoly that must be broken up because it acts in an anti-competitive manner.<br><br>
Scotland is a very small country with a population of only five million. We have open borders with England, Northern Ireland and any other country that people want to trade with. There is plenty of scope for competition—all the more so with the further concessions which will arise from the structural split between the producer co-op and Scottish Pride.<br><br>
Scottish Pride is demonstrably unsuitable for flotation on the stock exchange because it is far too small. It has annual pre-tax profits of about £3 million. It seems perfectly reasonable for the SMMB to propose arrangements for shares in Scottish Pride to remain in the hands of milk producers. It is proposed that there should be a limit on the size of individual shareholdings, but otherwise milk producers, including English producers who may be making supplies to Scottish Pride, should own the shares. It is proposed that milk producers should be able to trade shares among themselves, subject to any limits that may apply.<br><br>
The Scottish milk market is comparatively small and so inevitably, to a large extent, members of the Scottish milk cooperative and shareholders in Scottish Pride will, tend to be the same people, It would be wrong to have it any other way. A genuine arm's-length separation is being proposed. Scottish Pride will be a commercial operation under the proposals that have been conceded by the SMMB. I put it to the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland the SMMB is being messed around badly enough by the Government's proposals. As he is the Minister with responsibility for agriculture and the food industry in Scotland, I urge him to stand up for Scottish interests for once and to resist any further disruption or interference from Hexham or anywhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Sir Hector Munro)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for East Lothian; Mr. Home Robertson for his tour de force on the SMMB and for his early departure to the Defence Select Committee to talk about the SA 80. I hope that the will ask if the butt sling mounting has been improved. I understand that it has been impaired for the past year or two.<br><br>
In my brief intervention on the first day of our proceedings, I did not have an opportunity to declare an interest. I think that I should say that I was a dairy farmer from the beginning of the 1950s to the 1970s, when the pressures of the House encouraged me to change to beef and sheep. I am glad that I did so. Retrospectively, I have missed any payment that might be made when the boards break up.<br><br>
The simple amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham was correct when he tabled it. At that stage, the Scottish milk marketing board had not made clear its new proposals and it was right that we should debate whether it would do so. Subsequent to that the board made new proposals, which are under discussion, and we are pleased at the progress that is being made. The full scheme will be presented to the Secretary of State at the appropriate time. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham meant this to be a probing amendment to discover what is happening in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
Scotland. The debate since it was tabled has been widened extensively and there are several points to which I want to respond.<br><br>
The Bill covers four board—three in Scotland and the England and Wales board. It is not for the Government to lay down the blueprint for their future operations. It is up to the boards and the Government at the appropriate time to consider the schemes and to decide whether they are acceptable. We shall bear in mind that the schemes will have to meet the competition policy of the EC and the Government and the interests of the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. I have no doubt that we shall achieve acceptable solutions in all four board areas. We hope that the schemes will be in operation by April 1994 and that there will be a smooth and easy transition from the current position to the new. We also hope that dairy farming, milk production, distribution, consumption and manufacturing of milk will continue to operate smoothly.<br><br>
On the first day of our proceedings, the hon. Members for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) and for East Lothian commended the effective work that the boards have done over many years. I add my tribute to that, not only as a one-time producer but as someone who comes from a major dairy area where milk has been collected and distributed supremely effectively over many years. No one would want to return to the difficult position of the 1930s before the boards existed. That is why we are insistent that the final solution should carry on in the best tradition of the boards, with the addition of fair competition.<br><br>
We are beginning to get a clear idea of which proposition the boards will follow. There is no reason why they should not change the proposals between now and the time when they are submitted for scrutiny by the respective Secretaries of State. I would have resisted the amendment withdrawn by the hon. Member of Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), which was intended to impose a six-month delay. We want decisions to be made as early as possible. A statutory six months' consultation period might have extended the implemenation of the schemes beyond April 1994, when we hope that everything, if possible, will be in place.<br><br>
I do not think that my hon. Friend the Member of Hexham contemplated that we would have accepted his amendment. However, if we had, it would have scuppered the schemes for Aberdeen and the north of Scotland because they woud not have fulfilled the criteria in the amendment.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Lothian gave a good account of the plans for the Scottish board. I welcomed the original proposals last summer, when 97 per cent. of Scottish producers signed a petition in the hope that the milk board would continue as it then proposed. Unfortunately, that was before the OFT and the MMC took their decisions, shortly thereafter, the board realised that it had to take a route more similar to that taken by the milk marketing board and to make a clear distinction between production and distribution.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The revised proposals of the Scottish board envisage a complete separation of milk marketing activities and commercial activities—broadly speaking, Scottish Pride.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0050">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
Milk marketing activities would be carried out in a single producers' cooperative. Membership would be open to all producers in Scotland and elsewhere. The Scottish board intends to leave minimal net assets with the marketing cooperative, transferring the bulk of assets to the new commercial company, which will be Scottish Pride or any name that it chooses. The surplus of assets over liabilities in the Scottish Pride group will be represented by the shares to be issued to eligible producers, irrespective of whether they join the cooperative. Shares are expected to be tradeable, but it is unlikely that a quotation will be sought. Details are still being considered by the Scottish milk marketing board.<br><br>
The Aberdeen board will convert into a company cooperative under the Companies Act 1985. The company will take over the assets and liabilities of the Aberdeen board. Joiners and non-joiners will receive shares in the cooperative proportionate to milk produced in the preceding 12 months. Dividends will be payable on shares and, again, it is expected that shares will be tradeable. Exact details of that are still awaited.<br><br>
The North of Scotland board proposes a vertically integrated successor structure. Producers who join will be issued with a membership certificate to a nominal value of £1,000 and non-joiners will be paid £1,000 in cash.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for East Lothian said, those operations are minimal compared with those in England, but it is just as essential to get those schemes right because Scottish milk production is an important part of our agricultural production and we must not harm it in any way.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) made several points. With respect, I think that some of them relating to the articles of association were fanciful. Although, technically, anything could happen, and no one can foretell the future, I do not think that his more outspoken suggestions are likely to come into effect. I am sure that he realises that, whatever happens to Milk Marque, it will be subject to competition policy. Therefore, if Milk Marque suddenly starts to put a significant proportion of its milk into processing, I am sure that the competition authorities will examine that carefully. It is no help to suggest that it could create a new milk marketing board under a new name because that would be contrary to what we are trying to achieve in this legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours <span class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that my views are fanciful. That may be so, but Milk Marque might decide to set up a plant—perhaps in the south-west of England—which affects supplies of milk to other creameries and other processing plants in the surrounding area. The fact that it may not dominate the flow of milk nationally by being able to route it to its own processing plants in ten, 20 or 30 years' time is irrelevant. What is relevant is whether it can act regionally to direct milk in a particular way, which may affect the rights of access of other processing plants. That is a perfectly reasonable proposition. The Minister cannot write off those rules.<br><br>
I told the Committee that the rules were model rules; I now understand that they are not model rules, but were specifically amended or drawn up to provide for objectives laid down by the milk marketing board. That begs the question, why did it establish rules of that nature?
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 80</span>
The Committee is entitled to know because I suspect that it foresaw the possibility of entering the businesses in the way that I have suggested to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a question of balance and how much of the production of milk in the area is involved. If a significant quantity of milk went into manufacture, I am confident that the competition laws would come into operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the competition laws would come into operation. Is he saying that the competition laws are framed to make decisions about the flow of milk regionally, which may influence whether a particular dairy or processing plant is allocated milk fairly? Can the laws take, in isolation, a part of the country and make a decision about it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman would find that, if a substantial proportion of milk in any one area, whatever region, was directed into manufacture by that company and, therefore, unavailable for distribution in a wider field, the OFT and the MMC would study that because it is contrary to the intention of the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is right to raise such issues, although perhaps he is putting forward an extreme point, which would not happen in practice. We have not gone through all this simply to return to the creation of a host of mini-marketing boards throughout the country.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister a straight question? Why would the milk marketing board, representing the interests of Milk Marque, which wants 80 per cent. of the market and is on target for gaining more than 90 per cent., want the rules framed in such a way? Why did not it say, "We want to be milk brokers; we don't want to be processors"? Is not that an admission that it wants to be processors in the future? Does the Minister accept that that may be the milk marketing board's objective?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot read the mind of the board, which has every right to make any proposals that it likes. At the end of the day, the Secretary of State has to decide which is the gist of the clause. It sets out, in great detail, all the issues that must be considered before the Secretary of State gives approval. I am certain that that is one of many issues that will be taken into account.<br><br>
The hon. Member for North Cornwall rightly commented on the Northern Ireland milk marketing board, about which I made inquiries. The Government intend to proceed with an Order in Council immediately following the enactment of the Bill, which will facilitate changes in Northern Ireland in parallel with those in Great Britain. The decision on whether to approve the Northern Ireland board's scheme is a matter for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and will depend on details of the board's formal proposals and the provisions of the Bill.<br><br>
There are several features in milk production that distinguish Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom. There are considerable differences between markets in Scotland and Northern Ireland and there is no reason why the Northern Ireland board should necessarily
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 81</span>
have to follow the Scottish board in revising its plans to establish a vertically integrated successor body. The Northern Ireland board's processing arm—Dromona Quality Foods—is much smaller than the Scottish milk marketing board's commercial subsidiaries. Dromona processes about 20 per cent. of the Northern Ireland milk marketing board's milk: the Scottish milk marketing board's commercial subsidiaries process 33 per cent. of that board's milk.<br><br>
I think that the Secretary for Northern Ireland will study our debates carefully and will eventually propose a scheme satisfactory to producers in Northern Ireland. I hope that that gives some idea of the way in which thinking is now going.<br><br>
I am sure that after the more detailed explanation of the boards' position and of what they hope to achieve in the coming year my hon. Friend will want to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, the original purpose of the amendment was, to some extent, overtaken when the Scottish milk marketing board made its new plans. However, it has provided the opportunity of a foray across the border—something I always like-and has given the Committee an opportunity to discuss the situation in Scotland. I am careful about my remarks, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside is sitting behind me.<br><br>
The amendment has also given us an opportunity to emphasise the concerns of the processing industry in Scotland. I am grateful for the Minister's remarks. He has—for me, certainly—clarified how he would like matters in Scotland to end. I hope that the Scottish milk marketing board and others will hear what he has said. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Jean Corston <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 6, in page 3, line 13, leave out "take account" and insert "do not adversely affect".<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is to try to protect processors from what they fear may be the heavy arm of Milk Marque. The amendment relates to clause 3(2)(a)(iii) which refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"practices contained in the statement mentioned in section 2(2)(c)".</p></blockquote>
The statement required by section 2(2)(c) would relate to trading practices of a successor body. It would be submitted when applying for approval of a scheme of reorganisation. The present wording of paragraph (iii) refers merely to a requirement to
<br><blockquote><p>"take account of the interests of purchasers of milk".</p></blockquote>
Let us consider what is normally meant by taking account. We can take account of the weather today, or of the fact that, notwithstanding the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian, we are all bright eyed and bushy tailed, although some of us might have been more so with eight hours' sleep. We could take account of its being somebody's birthday today. We take account of factors that are in the past or over which we have no control.<br><br>
We are discussing a very specific trading arrangement. It would not be right for a successor body merely to take
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 82</span>
account of an industry that would depend on its activities. My hon. Friends who tabled the amendment and I feel strongly that the successor body should be required to adopt trading practices that will not adversely affect an industry that depends upon it.<br><br>
There have been tremendous changes in the milk processing industry in the past 30 years. A list of products made by processors 30 years ago would not be very long, but now we have a myriad of different forms of milk—skimmed, semi-skimmed, skimmed and UHT. There are yoghurts in all their forms, fromage frais, chilled, canned and frozen products and cheese products. Indeed, the food and drink industry is one of the biggest manufacturing industries in the country. Many jobs are involved. A dairy processing plant in Brislington in my constituency employs 145 people. They are directly dependent on a Milk Marque regime that does not merely take account of the industry's interests but is required to adopt practices that do not adversely affect it. It is not enough simply to say that it is important to take account of the industry's interests. There should be a stricter requirement to assist and not to frustrate the processing industry. We want a strong assurance that practices to which the statement refers will not adversely affect producers.</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minster of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may continue the analogy, we can take account of the weather and of having had four hours' sleep instead of eight hours. What we cannot do is to guarantee that we are not adversely affected by that. In fact, I feel adversely affected by the fact that I had only three hours' sleep last night and I hope that we have come to the end of that marathon.<br><br>
I recognise the anxieties of the hon. Member for Bristol, East (Ms. Corston) and am not dismissing them. I also have processing plants in my constituency, one of which was a management buy-out from the milk marketing board, which closed it; it had never done as well as it has since it was freed from the thraldom of belonging to that organisation. How someone is affected depends on where he comes from. I am reluctant to be too epigramatic, but the present arrangement is such a cosy cartel that it is difficult to think of any arrangement for the processors that would be as satisfactory as the present one.<br><br>
Our purpose is to put the sector into the marketplace. When we say that we require a statement of trading practices, that is not a platitude for the birds. We must examine the overall balance of the scheme to ensure that it is reasonable, but we cannot give the specific guarantee that the hon. Lady wants—that no one will be adversely affected. We cannot give such a guarantee.<br><br>
I cannot accept the amendment but I recognise the underlying anxieties and we shall take account of them when examining the balance of the scheme.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I give the Committee notice that I intend to speak at length on this group of amendments. It may be your wish, Mr. Hill, that we debate the clause stand part with these amendments because they refer to assets and it may avoid repetition.<br><br>
Amendment No. 7 simply deals with who gets what and is tabled in such a way as to allow Ministers to give the Committee their views on the matter.<br><br>
Amendment No. 29 covers evaluation of assets and begs a statement from Ministers on the valuation that may be placed on assets.<br><br>
Amendment No. 43 considers not only the distribution of assets at the time of reorganisation and the formation of Milk Marque but what might happen to those assets in the unlikely event that Milk Marque is wound up under a later dissolution. What would happen to those assets? Would they go only to members of Milk Marque or to the original claimants to the milk marketing boards' assets as at vesting day? That is the background to the general debate.<br><br>
The proposition before us is what will happen to the assets of the milk marketing board. On Second Reading, I suggested as carefully as possible that, while our instincts were to have many of the assets retained by the milk marketing board, in so far as it had built them up over several years, our views were not set in tablets of stone. Ministers might be in a similar mode of consideration, if I can use that term, my hon. Friends and I had only three hours' sleep last night as well. We have not reached a final view but I am sure that we shall have done so by the end of the Committee and Report stages. However, we tend towards not favouring the milk marketing board retaining the assets. We have reached that conclusion after a long consultation period with many people involved in the industry.<br><br>
During the debate, I have repeatedly come across the problem that the milk marketing boards' views appear to be dominated by self-interest when trying to attract contracts from producers. I do not know whether they take that view because they feel strong—they think that they will dominate, want to control the assets and genuinely believe that they can run the market objectively. In effect, that is what would have to happen were the Bill to be practicable and the milk marketing boards to control 80 or 90 per cent. of the market. Perhaps the boards take that view because they feel weak—they think that they must somehow cling on to the assets to try to influence who is granted the contracts, while no one knows who will get contracts from whom and while milk supplies are at stake.<br><br>
What is in the best interest of the industry? If one divorces oneself from the milk marketing board's problems about whether they will succeed and considers what should be done in the long-term interest of the industry over the next 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, one must make different judgements. One has to isolate the milk marketing boards' interests. In many ways, now is the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 84</span>
unique period in which to make such considerations because unless we do so now, when the milk marketing board is being wrapped up, we may never again have a window of opportunity. I beg members of the Committee and Ministers to escape from the pressures to help the milk marketing board through its difficulties with the setting up of Milk Marque and to consider what is in the best long term interests of the industry.<br><br>
In recent months, I have had a steady stream of people through my office, commenting that the United Kingdom is appalling in terms of collection of national data and livestock improvement. The Holstein Friesian Society of Great Britain and Ireland estimates that between £20 million and £30 million is spent annually on foreign genetic improvement material. That should never have been allowed to develop. That problem goes right through the provision of services in the industry. People feel that the market is skewed in the wrong direction because of the dominance of the milk marketing board. Thirty years ago, the United Kingdom was the world leader in these areas: now, we have been overtaken by the Dutch, the Danes, the Canadians, the Americans, the New Zealanders and several other countries.<br><br>
I listened to what the milk marketing board had to say and objectively tried to find a model for the United Kingdom. Everyone whom I consulted suggested the Dutch structure, which I shall describe as it begs the question why we cannot have the same structure in the United Kingdom, even if the milk marketing board cannot retain its assets in Milk Marque. If it is in the public interest that the milk marketing board should not retain those assets and that we should follow the Dutch example, that should happen. We are entitled to answers from Ministers about that proposal.<br><br>
The Dutch system was set up in 1874, in the form of the NRS herdbook. In 1943, Central Milk Records was set up and in 1946, the federation of AI organisations was established. In 1980, there were discussions on the amalgamation of all bodies involved in AI and in 1984, the existing NRS was established.<br><br>
I was sent an interesting document about the organisation, which states that today
<br><blockquote><p>"the main purpose of the NRS is to serve the farmers and the member organisations."</p></blockquote>
It has several activities and services as well as advisory services, which include
<br><blockquote><p>"production records, herdbook registration, type classification, milkability."</p></blockquote>
It controls
<br><blockquote><p>"milk meters, fat and protein laboratories, bloodtyping laboratories."</p></blockquote>
It provides for
<br><blockquote><p>"research, breeding values of sires and cows, type classification, herdmanagement tools, computer services (milk recording, AI, registration), PC-management programme, negotiation of labour conditions, support to farmers and associations".</p></blockquote>
The organisation publishes a magazine, in which it stipulated new developments in
<br><blockquote><p>"cattle information systems, new system for Identification & Registration, reorganisation of provincial and local organisations."</p></blockquote>
It was responsible for the
<br><blockquote><p>"foundation of Taurus (to standardise data and communication in animal husbandry); foundation of Embrytec (biotechnical research for AI)".</p></blockquote>
Holland has a very sophisticated operation. The document continues;
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 85</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Since October 1991 all new born calves have to be identified by two eartags within three days after birth. On the eartag the lifetime number, barcode and an early tag number (four digits) are printed. A voice response system is used to collect registrations. The farmer uses the key-board on his telephone to type in the data: eartag number of the calf … dam's number, calf s sex … Information is available for all calves and the insemination data are also available … The herdbook registration can be done in an easy way. From May 1992 all cattle, which will be transported, has to be identified by eartags and besides the births the selling and buying must be registered again: this will be done by telephone. Slaughter houses and exporters have to collect the lifetime numbers. Slaughter houses will read the numbers by barcode."</p></blockquote>
Holland has a very automated system in operation. The document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We know exactly on which farm an animal is or has been … Next year, the Netherlands will have a system, covering all changes in the entire livestock: registering births, transport, selling, buying, export and slaughtering … Because of the stop of the vaccination for foot and mouth disease and in order to reduce the costs of other preventive programmes … the new system is of great importance for animal health and cattle breeding."</p></blockquote>
Holland obviously has a very sophisticated operation. I believe that we should model developments in the United Kingdom on that system. How is the system funded in Holland? The Dutch Government does not financially support animal breeding. The farmers union—which I understand is structured slightly differently in Holland—and the dairy industry contribute. The document states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Farmers Union supports the regulation, supervision and computer activities for milk recording and the calculation of breeding values in particular. The Dairy mainly supports the costs for the fat and protein determination and for the cell count"—in other words, testing.</p></blockquote>
11.15 am<br><br>
The document states that the NRS—the national service—
<br><blockquote><p>"aims to keep the general cost as low as possible. Its philosophy is that the delivered services must be paid for."</p></blockquote>
All information in Holland, under the NRS scheme, is held on a central database called NIS. The NIS data include information on all dairy cows—pedigree and others. The data stored for those cows concern, according to the document,
<br><blockquote><p>"calving dates, registration parents, test-day milk production, lactation, 305-days production, inseminations, implantations, breeding values for different traits, type classification, calving problems, cell counts".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"As these data are stored in one data base, all data concerning performance and ancestors of each dairy cow are easily accessible. Moreover, the data of all, calves, maiden heifers of a certain dairy herd and AI sires can be found in NIS. NIS gives access not only to animal data, but also to all relevant data of a dairy herd, such as production averages, herd index, etc. These data are valuable for herd management"</p></blockquote>
to those who apply for information which they may be able to use in the management of their own herds.<br><br>
We all know of problems that have arisen in recent years in the United Kingdom when it has been impossible to locate animals. We had problems over BSE. I understand that in 1990 the Select Committee on Agriculture recommended a comprehensive system for identifying and tracking animals. That came after an admission by the Ministry, for which unfortunately I cannot help <i>Hansard</i> by providing a reference—I am afraid it will have to look it up itself—that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 86</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"it is inevitable that some animals might not be traced using the existing systems."</p></blockquote>
My remark about <i>Hansard</i> referred to some difficulties that we have had in finding the sources of some of my contributions. We found them in the end.<br><br>
The Select Committee on Agriculture has recognised a problem in ensuring that data is held nationally in a form that allows the tracing of animals in the United Kingdom. We recently had difficulty in this respect over foot and mouth, although in so far as the records at importation appear to have been doctored, it may well be that even under the system in question the wrong information could have been fed into a national data centre.<br><br>
Nevertheless, there have been admissions of difficulties. In response to those worries the milk marketing board, quite rightly and imaginatively, with the National Cattle Breeder's Association, commissioned a report, which I believe is vital—the Wilson report. That report made several recommendations.<br><br>
My reasons for saying all that I have said is that we are being led to the structure of an industry in which certain assets are held by independent bodies outside the milk marketing board and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. That proposition is not necessarily my recommendation but that of those who know the industry backwards and who understand the problems and the requirements for the future. The Wilson committee stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"The overall rate of cattle improvement by genetic means in the UK is little short of deplorable. A country which once led the world in livestock improvement … has now changed to a situation in which the UK has been overtaken by"</p></blockquote>
other countries which are listed
<br><blockquote><p>"and, at the present state of progress it is likely in the course of the next two decades to end up with one of the lowest rates of genetic improvement throughout the EEC."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"This fact was widely recognised by respondents"</p></blockquote>
with whom the committee was in contact during its investigation. It refers to:
<br><blockquote><p>"massive importations of genetically superior genes"</p></blockquote>
and that the centres of excellence in the United Kingdom are
<br><blockquote><p>"extremely diverse and disparate. For instance there are more breeds and Breed Societies in the UK than in any other European country. There are numerous methods of identifying cattle and allocating numbers to them and it is quite possible at present for the same number to be allocated to more than one animal."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The unique identification of every single animal in the UK is fundamental to livestock improvement. The identity of the animal is the primary source of information for all subsequent records. At the farm level, this unique identification is vital for management purposes and disease control, but at the genetic level animal identification is required to enable the data from all related cattle to be assembled and collated so that breeding values can be ascribed to cows and bulls alike."</p></blockquote>
The recommendations in the Wilson report are critical to our debate. Its summary states
<br><blockquote><p>"That the paramount aim of the Cattle Data Centre"—</p></blockquote>
which is now the Animal Data Centre—
<br><blockquote><p>"is a profitable and efficient UK cattle industry able to compete internationally."</p></blockquote>
It suggested that the United Kingdom Animal Data Centre should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 87</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"be established as a matter of urgency. Its task will be to link together and coordinate: … All existing cattle databases … Cattle identification within the UK on a unique number basis … Cattle ancestry and its validation within the UK … All milk recording within the UK to International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) standards, including DIY recording … Beef recording within the UK … Genetic evaluation of cattle … Linear assessment of cattle."</p></blockquote>
The report goes on to recommend that the ADC should
<br><blockquote><p>"be governed by an independent board representative of the whole industry … That the chairman be an independent appointment from the industry…That the Milk Recording Organisation (MROs) become self financing and autonomous, with close links with the CDC prior to full integration."</p></blockquote>
The report as I understand it was recommending that National Milk Records should stand apart from the milk marketing board. That is the way in which we should be moving forward unless Ministers can find some other justification for the NMR to be retained by the milk marketing board.<br><br>
There has been a general acceptance of problems throughout the industry. The Dutch system has been recognised as a model for the future. The recommendations by the Select Committee have drawn attention to the deficiency in information on sources. I have set out the Wilson committee's recommendations and the ADC has been formed. All of that has pointed in the right direction.<br><br>
I want to draw the Committee's attention to the excellent document produced by the ADC. It includes a picture of the ear tag that would be used were we to go down what I call the Dutch route. To be honest, I do not want to do anything that would prejudice the formation of that organisation and I do not want Ministers to do anything that would impede the development of a national system for all animals. The system would extend beyond dairy cows and beef. In the future, all animals on farms will be subject to a tagging system as part of a national data base on which we could call.<br><br>
The tag is being used in this country on a limited basis. Built into it are the farm and country holding number, the country code, the individual animal number, the check digit, the bar code and the management number or NMR line number. All of those can be read off. Under the Dutch system, the information can also be fed through to a personal computer on a farm. That seems to be a natural and sensible way to develop the industry. Everyone has to subscribe to the system and everyone has access to information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be in order for me to propose amendment No. 7? I say that because we seem to be having a clause stand part debate. I did not agree that that course should be taken when the hon. Member raised the matter earlier. We must return to the amendments. From time to time, other members of the Committee may want to contribute to some of the important points that are being made. If the hon. Member drew his remarks to a close now, there would be plenty of time for the debate to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand your proposition, Mr. Hill, but before we discuss the amendments it is important that the likely future framework of the industry is set out. If the Committee were to divide on the amendment—I do not think that it would want to do so—our discussion would, to some extent, influence how
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 88</span>
Members would vote. I do not want to repeat what I am saying again and again as we deal with each amendment.<br><br>
With great respect to you, Mr. Hill, I have sat on Committees where the Chairs have been flexible and have realised that it was in the interests of the Committee, in terms of saving time, to venture from discussing the amendments into a sort of clause stand part debate in the knowledge that there might not be such a debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman means that he does not want a clause stand part—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire for a clause stand part debate, but I cannot speak for every member of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I say that I understand the hon. Gentleman's intention. I shall answer questions about the amendments and try to respond to the more general points. That may assist him. I understand that he is probing and does not necessarily want to press the amendments to a Division. Perhaps that approach would enable us to make a little more haste further down the list of amendments that relate to clause 3. I am sure that something could be fixed up between us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course. Perhaps I should propose the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Shall I carry on?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. I want the Committee to return to the normal procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were going down that route very successfully until Milk Marque—or rather the milk marketing boards which represent the interests of Milk Marque—surfaced on the agenda. The moment the boards began to talk about assets being retained, the potential for going down the national data centre route was damaged. There was the danger that the industry would be fragmented. Much of the correspondence in the farming press and much of the representations that have been made to me have been not about the Dairy Trade Federation trying to undermine Milk Marque's credibility—that has been alleged by some people in the milk marketing board—but have related to a genuine argument about whether it is in the industry's best interests for Milk Marque to retain the assets when it is known that that may lead to fragmentation and the development of a movement down the Dutch route.<br><br>
I am extremely conscious that the MMBs feel strongly that they want to retain the assets, but I ask them to be objective. They must think beyond the period of reorganisation and vesting day. They must think in terms of what the market will look like in 10 or 15 years' time. It concerns me that a little self-interest—which is understandable—has been allowed to creep into deliberations on these matters. The industry has been divided over this issue.<br><br>
In my room down the Corridor I have a fax machine. Hardly an hour goes by—I exaggerate to make my case but it happens at least several times a day—without someone faxing through a protest about the way in which the assets are being distributed. Those people are not from the dairy
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 89</span>
companies, which have put their case in the briefs that they have sent to us. We know what their motives are. But they do not determine what will happen to the assets. That is determined by people in the industry, who want the industry to have a proper national recording system and a national Animal Data Centre, into which information can be fed through computers operating throughout the country. That is the way forward.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that I agree with him about the Animal Data Centre, which began, and remains, in my constituency. I have considerable knowledge of it and I agree with him entirely, except that I am not sure that fragmentation is a problem. I appreciate that if Milk Marque were to retain the assets, it would encourage other dairy companies to set up recording and testing services for farmers. That would not be a problem, provided that the data were kept in such a way that they could be transferred to, or used by, a central Animal Data Centre.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to central testing, which is another issue. I shall talk about that later. We must be careful to separate central testing from national milk recording under the NMR and the ADC. I am sure that hon. Members have seen the correspondence on that matter in the national press. I have it before me, but I shall not refer to it in detail and take up the Committee's time. It is clear, however, that people do not want Milk Marque representatives on their farms if they have contracted directly with processors.<br><br>
That raises an issue about the confidentiality of the records that are retained. The dairy companies want to know why their competitors should have access to their producer base—the people who supply their milk. That argument is perfectly reasonable. If people start to withdraw from the NMR, of which about 41.6 per cent. of producers are members, what will happen to our objective of creating one organisation that collects all the data?<br><br>
We do not want a structure that will lead to fragmentation in the market, but everything points to the need to separate NMR and the ADC from the MMB. But how would that be funded?<br><br>
Something else worries me. As people foresee the possibility of fragmentation, some organisations are beginning to see whether they can find a small niche in the market. Some people at Reading university have suggested setting up some sort of milk recording agency. That fragmentation worries me because we need an organisation in which everyone can have confidence.<br><br>
How will that organisation be funded? The Bill provides for a development council. Clearly, it will have to be funded by some sort of levy. That levy should be used to pay for the ADC, and if the NMR and the ADC are combined in one organisation, the levy would fund the NMR, in part. However, the NMR could sell some of its services elsewhere. So, there are several ways in which it could be made self-financing rather than financed by the taxpayer. All the evidence on milk recording and the ADC supports some type of independent organisation that is separate from Milk Marque.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 90</span>
I want to deal with central testing and Genus. We made a wide trawl of people in the industry—sometimes when one is dealing with brief in Committee, one takes the paper that comes through the post, reads it on to the record and embroiders it with a speech, but we have never dealt with the Bill in that way, as the Minister knows. The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food made a speech about potatoes on the Floor of the House, which proved that the extent to which we had been consulting on potato supply and production in the United Kingdom had come to his attention.<br><br>
We consulted widely on Genus and central testing and, generally, people are fairly indifferent about what happens to Genus. They are not worried whether the milk marketing board or Milk Marque retains it or not. In the past few days, however, there have been a few complaints. I drew attention to an article the other day about how Genus was arranging its invoicing in such a way that some people felt penalised but, forgetting that, in the main, people were unperturbed by whatever proposals the Minister might come up with.<br><br>
Central Testing appeared to be one of the most controversial subjects. Everyone recognised that the MMB had managerial expertise available to it and that, over the years, it had performed an exceptionally good job—it successfully instilled confidence in the producers. When Central Testing says, "This is what your milk is", no one argues—at least, no argument has been brought to my attention. It is accepted as the truth. The problem is that many people ask why, if they are supplying milk to organisations other than Milk Marque, they should be required to use Central Testing's facilities. That is a legitimate discussion. Why should they be required to use Central Testing's facilities? It is not as if they can say to their buyer—Northern Foods for example—"You put in testing facilities and we'll accept your findings", because there is a problem of trust. I do not want to attack the integrity of members of the DTF, but many producers suggest that they would find it difficult to trust a judgment on the quality of their milk made by a processor or a dairy. The producers want an independent body to be responsible for telling them the quality and count of the milk that they sell. Again, people said that if they were not selling milk to Milk Marque but direct to processors, they would not allow Central Testing to deal with their milk, but would find another arrangement. Unless Central Testing is removed from the MMB and set up under an independent authority, all sorts of small organisations will set up nationally to take over the function.<br><br>
I understand that rationalisation of Central Testing is taking place in the MMB, resulting in a reduction of the cost of the service. The service becomes more and more efficient, and people want to use Central Testing. They do no want small organisations or the processors to provide testing faculties. They want an independent organisation to make the judgments for them. We were told repeatedly that Central Testing should be a separate organisation. I know that that is heresy to the MMB, but that is what the market wants. I do not think that the MMB is being told the truth by many people to whom it thinks that it is closest. I think that it is being misled. I have spoken to people who publicly say one thing and privately say the reverse. They have made statements in the press saying that they want Central Testing to be transferred to Milk Marque, but if one squeezes them in private discussions they say that that is not so and that it is only their public
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 91</span>
position. Genuine debate cannot be conducted on that basis. I wonder to what extent that is happening at the meetings—the Punch and Judy shows—around the country. How many farmers get up and say what they really think? How many simply back what the milk marketing board says from a sense of loyalty—I understand that because the board has served them wonderfully for many years—when they really want an independent organisation to be set up in the new marketing conditions?<br><br>
In conclusion, people have an open mind about Genus, National Milk Records and ADC should be independent organisations to get over the problem of confidentiality. We should take the Dutch route to a proper data base and national registration arrangement.<br><br>
Central Testing should also be independent. I realised that that is what people really wanted, whether or not they were saying so publicly. I asked them how it should be paid for and the general view that it should be paid for from a levy, perhaps from the Milk Development Council. They do not want some people to be in and some to be out. If the service is available nationally and people are required to pay the levy on the basis of the number of animals who are tested centrally, the cost would be fairly shared by the industry. Some people even suggested that the processors should contribute. At the end of the day the customer pays and where it is levied probably depends on where it creates the least embarrasment to the levying authority.<br><br>
That is our case and I hope that it is similar to the Minister's. My conclusions have been drawn from the professionals in the industry, who know what they are talking about and do not have an axe to grind. If the Minister takes us down that route, we shall do the industry a service in the longer term.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I shall find lot of common ground with the hon. member for Workington. There will inevitably be one difference because it is the hon. Gentleman's duty to spell out to the Committee what he believes is acceptable, whereas I must ultimately receive a scheme and must not prejudge the decision because that would betray the final judgmental view to be taken by the Ministry. I know that the hon. Gentleman accepts that there must be more nuances in what I say.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to ear tagging and having just introduced the cattle indentification document scheme for the live auction market, the subject sends a frission down my back at the moment. I am anxious not to multiply that difficulty.<br><br>
I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman said about the Dutch scheme and it is perhaps salutary not to repeat that our agriculture is the best in the world. Overall, we are pretty damned good, but in some sectors other countries are just a little bit better.<br><br>
It is as well for us to remember that we are not always in a position to give lectures to the rest of humanity.<br><br>
Having started on that modest note, let me try to cover the points that have been made. First, we hope that Milk Marque will not be wound up and that it will be a going concern, but the problem may arise and there are two possible ways of dealing with it. Either everybody who was present at its birth would get a stake or those who do not join would receive some extra compensation in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 92</span>
respect of the assets retained by Milk Marque, which would discharge the responsibility to the non-joiners because they would have been bought out at an early stage.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Neither of those schemes is necessarily desirable, but they are options and each addresses a particular problem. The Scottish board is giving all its assets to its commercial arm and distributing them. The Scottish boards are likely to issue certificates of entitlement to all producers to share in any surplus on the winding up of a successor body. The England and Wales board could take the same route, although a number of avenues could be taken to the deal with this clearly recognised problem.<br><br>
We should not forget that we must consider the eventual distribution of the assets of the residuary body. The English and Welsh boards will have to endow a residuary body to undertake mechanical tasks, such as to continue to pay farmers for their milk in the final days of the old scheme, and to face up to possible liabilities resulting from court actions.<br><br>
If Ministers felt that the board had not endowed the residuary body with sufficient assets, they would be able to intervene in the period between approval of a scheme and its coming into effect to require more resources to be given to the residuary body to enable it to discharge its responsibilities. When the slate was clean and it had discharged its responsibilities, those assets would have to be distributed.<br><br>
There are three categories of assets in respect of the English and Welsh board. In his previous answer, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland dealt with the assets of the Scottish board quite extensively. The three categories are the assets of the milk marketing board as it exists now, the assets of the residuary body and what eventually happens to them and the assets of the successor body. It is relevant to consider those categories briefly.<br><br>
For the milk marketing board the issue is whether there should be compensation for non-joiners in return for the retention of assets by Milk Marque, because the assets that are retained qualify for national aid under the Community's definition. We must have discussions with Brussels about whether some compensation has to be paid. That is still a five issue. The hon. Member for Workington said that he has not yet come to a definitive view. I am, therefore, being quite frank with the Committee. The board and the Government have some unfinished business that has to be resolved.<br><br>
What assets should be retained and distributed? The key factor is that the board should not seek to retain assets, because that would create an unreasonable and unfair incentive to producers to sign up with Milk Marque rather than one of the other groups. To do so would be self-defeating, because if it were clear that the signing-up rate was so overwhelming and was influenced by the need to have a stake in those assets, the pressure for intervention on competition grounds would become very strong. But there is a prior consideration, and I shall spell it out clearly. If the Ministry and the Scottish Office felt that there was an undue incentive to producers to sign up with a particular scheme, we could not approve the scheme because it would fail the test of promoting
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0057">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 93</span>
competition. It would not reach the stage at which there would have to be a further intervention by competition authorities, because we would have to say to the board, "Sorry, this is not delivering one of the fundamental criteria because one of the elements of the balance has not effectively been addressed."<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made a point about individual assets.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When a reorgansiation is being considered and approved, the contractual arrangements between Milk Marque and the processors may not have been tied up. How can the Minister make a judgment? As he said, he would be making a judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The judgment that we should have to make would be whether the proposals, insofar as they cover the assets, appear to constitute an unreasonable incentive to producers to make one decision as opposed to another. It is a judgmental matter. As the hon. Gentleman said, it would involve forming a judgment on the likely rates of sign-up. The hon. Gentleman has already made several judgments about what he expects to be the rate of sign-up.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made a point about specific assets and mentioned several. One is Thames Ditton itself. The valuation of Thames Ditton depends on whether the present application for planning permission, in association with Tesco, succeeds. There is also a question about transport, but most of the transport goes with Dairy Crest. I do not think that anyone could reasonably think that if a group of farmers wanted to set up by themselves, the back-axle of a milk wagon would be a useful asset to take.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman. I thought when the debate began that Genus would be virtually the flashpoint. My conversations have in fact led me to conclusions similar to his—Genus is not quite the sensitive, focal issue in relation to assets that I had expected it to be. Without drawing any conclusions—which I may not do-I should agree that the organisations mentioned by the hon. Gentleman have emerged in the public debate as involving particular sensitivity.<br><br>
National Milk Records could, as the hon. Gentleman said, be wholly funded by a development council. Perhaps, to assist the Committee, I should declare that the Animal Data Centre could not be wholly funded by the development council because it covers a wider subject area than milk. It could be partly funded. That is a wrinkle, but one that should be pointed out, for the sake of precision.<br><br>
We do not wish to tilt the playing field against Milk Marque. None of us, I think, would say that we do not wish it to start with at least a sensible base, so that it can launch itself into the marketplace and set out to perform the task that it wishes to do. We are considering level playing fields and there is a judgment to be made. That is why we have talked about reasonableness and balance and tried to fend off arguments that one point will be more reasonable than another or that one point should be highlighted rather than another.<br><br>
As to the assets, the group balance sheet for 1991–92 shows the value of the shareholding in Dairy Crest as £206 million—about 75 per cent. of the fixed assets of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 94</span>
board. Assets less liabilities equal about £142 million. When we receive the milk marketing board reorgansiation scheme, one of the options open to us will be to seek an independent, professional valuation. Clearly, whether they are put down as break-up assets, liquidation assets or ongoing assets, they would substantially affect the valuation. We may decide that it is sensible to seek an independent judgment of what they are worth.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clarify something which I found difficult to ascertain. If assets such as Central Testing and, in particular, National Milk Records, were to go to an independent development council, would they not in effect be valued at zero? I imagine that, if asked, the milk marketing board would say that they were not worth anything at the moment, but of course they are worth something potentially, because the market can be arranged to make them profitable operations. If they went to an independent development council, there would be no benefit to farmers, in that nothing would be liquidated; the assets would simply be transferred. However, if they were retained by the milk marketing board under Milk Marque, everyone could argue that they have a value and should be shared out. Does the Minister understand my point? I found it hard to get to the truth when I discussed that issue outside the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He is right to say that people feel that those records constitute a stock of intellectual assets, which should not be held by a body that has a particular commercial role in the industry. The assets are losing money at the moment. Clearly, we are talking partly about psychology and partly about perception. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that people who have been debating the issue think that it is psychologically important.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are not talking about Genus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. We are talking about National Milk Records, which is the other side of the argument. Perhaps I may be able to help the hon. Gentleman. I have a list of organisations that are capable of undertaking quality payment testing for farmers. It was only in 1982 that quality milk testing was undertaken by the board. Before that, dairy companies undertook quality payment testing on behalf of the board schemes. There was a code of practice and companies did their own testing or subcontracted testing to companies with laboratories. Most of the 200 or so major dairy companies have laboratories.<br><br>
I have a list of companies that provide instruments for testing, although I shall not do a commercial break. In addition to the dairy companies, the Agricultural Development Advisory Service, the West of Scotland agricultural college, the food research association in Leatherhead, the Campden food research association and the West Riding of Yorkshire milk testing service—which I am sure that you would expect me to commend in particular, Mr. Hill—can undertake contract testing, as can many public analysts. A marketplace is out there, with facilities and water authorities or hospitals that may also be interested in undertaking contract testing. We are not discussing a service that has such a unique quality that we should forget commercial possibilities.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 95</span>
I hope that I have answered as clearly as possible, given the final judgment which must be made. I told the hon. Gentleman that, whatever people think, his perception is right. We must try to establish a scheme that is fair and balanced and does not tilt the playing field one way or the other. If it is tilted too far one way, there should be mechanisms to check it. The board must be aware of such considerations when it puts the scheme forward for approval.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My conclusion after the work that I did, was that Milk Marque could easily survive and succeed if it did not retain the services. Therefore, it must produce an additional argument as to why it should retain them. Will the Minister endorse that as a view? There are two different judgments that must be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, the debate has focused on the future of the assets. Indeed, it has focused on particular assets—the Committee has agreed on which assets have become rather sensitive. When the board deals with those assets, it will have to explain its argument clearly—one way or the other—in the knowledge of our debate and that concern.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall contribute briefly to the discussion, which has been very helpful. I welcome the Minister's comments. As members of the Committee will appreciate, I am used to speaking on behalf of minorities. It is important that we consider for a moment what might happen were a considerable majority of producers to sign up to Milk Marque. I have made it clear to the Committee that I think that producers will find the market difficult to five in. In such circumstances, we should consider what might happen if, voluntarily, without the playing field being tilted too far in their direction—the Minister has very properly said that he does not want the field tilted in one direction or another—a large majority of producers decide to come together.<br><br>
My fear is that we may artificially force precisely the sort of disintegration of facilities that the hon. Member for Workington was right to suggest might happen if it went in the opposite direction.<br><br>
I was diverted by something that the hon. Member for Workington said. He said that when people met him and expressed an opinion, he privately squeezed them into changing their views. Perhaps in privately squeezing them he put to them a set of circumstances so hypothetical as not to be important. Perhaps they were concerned about what might happen if Milk Marque did not get the majority of producers on board. My concern is that the valuable work that the various agencies have provided for the industry might be allowed to go down the drain. We should examine the extent to which some sort of independence or arm's-length relationship can be achieved that will still provide the best possible service to the producer.<br><br>
Central Testing and National Milk Records have a natural linkage. It would be unfortunate if, for arbitary reasons, we forced them in different directions, when the linkage between them is even more important than their linkage with Milk Marque. I do not think that there is the same controversy about Genus. I agree with the Minister
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 96</span>
and the hon. Member for Workington because it is right to argue that the great skills and expertise, which have been built up over a long time, should not be lost for artificial reasons.<br><br>
I believe that the interests of the minority, however small, are extremely important. However, it would be all too easy to fall over backwards to protect the interests of what might turnout to be a tiny minority and, by so doing, make it difficult for the new organisation to serve the whole industry.<br><br>
I want to refer briefly to amendment No. 7 which is important in this context. If we are not careful, we could establish a precedent which we would not want eleswhere in the Bill. If we agreed to amendment No. 7 we might raise the expectations of a producer or farmer who has some time ago withdrawn from producton to believe that he was entitled to a substantial proportion of what an on-going current or more recent producer was entitled to.<br><br>
As a matter of principle, a farmer-producer who has cashed in his quota some years ago and who has retired from the industry, having gained a monetary value from that activity, cannot be considered to be on all fours with someone who is still a component part of the operation. For that reason, it is extremely important that we establish our attitude to that precedent now. We have to give a clear signal to existing producers that their share will not be reduced by someone who receives a financial reward even though he has already been bought out.<br><br>
If my understanding of amendment No. 7 is correct, I hope that the Committee will dispose of it by one means or another. In the meantime, I am grateful for the Minister's explanation of his attitude to the issue of assets and I hope that, in our debates on other clauses, we shall consider equally the interests of the minority and the substantial majority who, I hope will sign up to Milk Marque.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: At our last sitting, recorded in column 51 of <i>Hansard,</i> I referred to the winding up of the egg scheme some years ago. That arose from a conversation last weekend with farmers in my constituency. A medium-sized egg producer put several questions in the minds of milk producers and, on behalf of those producers, I should like to ask the Minister for an assurance. The last time that the Clerk and I were in this Room was during the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill when the Government made great play of trade unions and block votes. I should like to reverse that and ask the Minister for an assurance that, in considering issues relating to the distribution of assets, he will not simply respond to the interests of the big players, but will carefully consider the interests of small and medium-sized producers.<br><br>
That point arose during the egg debate, when it was alleged that, on the final distribution of assets, several million pounds was used for an advertising campaign. The assertion was that that advertising campaign played into the hands of the big players but gave no material benefit to those at the smaller end of the market. I am not familiar with the history of that debate, but farmers told me that in an open session. Therefore, I should like the Minister's assurance that, in any distribution of assets, he will not simply have regard to the largest players.<br><br>
I listened carefully to the Minister's comments about asset values and should like to ask him whether the figures to which he referred were book values on property or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0059">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 97</span>
intellectual values? That is especially interesting in relation to computing. One might draw an analogy with that appropriate computer system, TAURUS, which was an expensive piece of kit and which is probably worthless today. Will the Minister tell us how those figures were derived?<br><br>
The Minister referred, in an interesting throw-away line, to schemes for water authorities or hospitals. That is an intriguing thought. As someone who believes that public administration is too compartmentalised, I can think of some good ways in which that might evolve. However, if such schemes are approved—especially in the context of hospital services—I am concerned that, when a contract runs out or a large-scale contract is suddenly introduced, patient care could be affected. That is not directly relevant to the Bill, but I am sure that it was a serious thought and not a throw-away line by the Minister. I hope that in developing such thoughts he will ensure that detailed discussions take place with his ministerial colleagues to ensure that proper priority is given to the protection of patient care and that it does not become simply a commercial arm of a health authority or a different arm of a water company.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) referred to distribution of assets. I am not sure that the analogy to eggs was helpful. If assets are to be distributed, they must go directly to the producers and not to an intermediate body, which may spend them on an advertising campaign. The distribution should be directly back to the producers. The argument is which ones would receive them. The milk marketing board has not been bashful in giving the Committee information and I am sure that it would be happy to distribute its annual report, which will contain the basis of the valuations.<br><br>
The only point that I was making about hospitals was that the expertise to carry out specific jobs is fairly widely available. I did not intend to suggest anything other than that and I certainly did not intend to launch myself into a debate on the priorities of the national health service.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for North Cornwall that there are two issues—the sign-up rate to Milk Marque and how it will achieve that. The legitimate point was made that the way in which it goes about that should be fair. Once it has power in the market place, the question arises of how it will use that power. We agreed earlier that the percentage amount of its power is less important than the fact that it should not abuse its power.<br><br>
On the issue of assets to previous producers, the board must come up with a scheme and I think it unlikely, for the reasons stated by the hon. Member for Norm Cornwall, that it would want to distribute to people who have ceased to be milk producers and have realised then-assets connected with the quota system. I do not know what scheme will be introduced, but I would be surprised if it rewarded people who had got out of the sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall detain the Committee only briefly on a narrow, technical point.<br><br>
Clause 3 covers reorganisation, and schedule 1 and the following schedules state in detail how that will be operated. The value of milk is calculated in terms of its
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 98</span>
constituent parts, and the two principal constitutent parts are protein and fat. Members of Quality Milk Producers provide high-quality milk, mainly from Guernsey and Jersey cows. They are paid on the basis of value, as I have described. Clause 3(4)(b) to which amendment 29 refers, states:
<br><blockquote><p>"whether the scheme makes reasonable provision for the distribution of assets to … registered producers".</p></blockquote>
That is important. Clause 3(5)(b) states that the scheme
<br><blockquote><p>"provides for any such distribution to be made by reference to milk produced in a specified period".</p></blockquote>
It does not refer to the value of milk produced.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned that Dairy Crest would be floated prior to vesting day. He said that its value will be between £200 million and £300 million, which is a substantial sum of money.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
The way that the value of milk is quantified makes an important difference of £1 million to Quality Milk Producers, which is a small group of producers. It is an issue of equity and logic whether the milk should be paid for on volume or on value. When the Minister considers a scheme of reorganisation, I hope that he will carefully think about that matter. Having seen a levy taken off the producers by the MMB, which since 1987 has been repaid to them on value on a yearly basis, it would be inequitable if the considerable assets of Dairy Crest were redistributed on the basis of volume rather than value. Quality Milk Producers would be disadvantagd to the tune of £1 million.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's point. Is he aware that the only precedent for the distribution of assets or liabilities in this context is the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 and the milk marketing scheme. Any allocations of liabilities in the winding up of the existing board would be based on the maximum number of milch cows in a person's possession during a specified period. That would be closer to an allocation on the basis of value rather than the amount of litres. The proper concern of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Clifton-Brown) is backed up by precedent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is exactly right. This is, of course, an enabling Bill. I do not know whether the Minister will be prepared to give us any guidance today. If not, I hope that he will take the matter into account so that Quality Milk Producers can be treated in equity and in logic, as is fair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The present wording would allow a distribution according to the value of milk produced, but is up to the board what it proposes. There could be practical difficulties in determining value for producers who do not sell to the board. The board will have heard what the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury said. There are practical difficulties and I shall pay regard to the hon. Gentleman's point when I consider the scheme.</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a helpful and interesting debate about assets. A major theme of the Bill is that of consultation, and it is right that that should happen in a period of change where there are uncertainties. Everyone should have a chance to be consulted and to examine details. it has been made clear that the board will have to come forward with a successor scheme. It is also clear from clause 2 that the board will not consult. It must show that it has a new scheme which will work. Under clause 3, consultation must be undertaken by the Minister. Before exercising a judgment on the successor scheme, he must consult bodies and interests as appropriate. It is important that there is proper and full discussion about the way forward.<br><br>
The Bill makes it clear that consultation is to be on the principles of the scheme, not necessarily on the details. There has been much discussion in the industry about the distinction between detail and principle. One person's point of principle could be, in another person's eyes, a mere point of detail. The words in the Bill are, as I understand it, the concession given when the Lords considered the issue, following amendments tabled by Lords Gallacher and Mottistone. There is a strong case for going further, rather than consulting on principles.<br><br>
The key word in the amendment is disclosure. Put bluntly, interested parties should have a right to review the documents relating to the board's future plans. Clearly, the opinion is that more information should be made available to consultees. They might argue to see details of essentially commercial matters—for example, the machinery for fixing prices, arrangements for dealing with overdemand, quality standards for milk sold and, perhaps essentially, details of arbitration and dispute procedures. Those are fundamental issues, which may be considered as points of principle rather than as points of detail. It is important that those matters are given full consideration and that all parties—producers, processors and consumers—have a say in examining the details.<br><br>
Lord Howe addressed that question in the debate on 25 January. To paraphrase his comments, he said that the principles of the scheme were its main elements and that those elements did not provide an especially sufficient picture of the scheme as a whole. Consultees could reasonably be expected to form an opinion without reading the full details. He went on to exclude certain aspects on which there would be no consideration, such as schedules of property and issues of commercial sensitivity. That leaves plenty of room for argument by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 100</span>
consultees about the nature of the information made available. Just as from time to time in negotiations there need to be talks about talks, so on this subject there is a pressing need for discussion with interested parties about the level of detail that will be given. Perhaps the easiest solution is for Ministers to come clean and produce and publish the submissions that they receive. Care must be taken with commercially sensitive matters. The argument on this subject will continue, but the easy way forward is for the Minister to undertake to publish and disclose information.<br><br>
There is another group of people who want to be consulted—pensioners of the milk marketing scheme, who are concerned about their future. Amendment No. 109 takes that issue further. Any reorganisation must address pension provision. Pensioners have a right to be consulted and I hope that the Minister will give them some reassurances. As I understand it, there are about 8,600 contributors to the scheme and 5,500 pensioners, of whom about 1,000 are widows, they have a clear interest in this important matter. We must recognise that the pension trust has assets of about £300 million.<br><br>
I should point out that the issue is important not just for this pension fund but for many others that have no pensioners on the trust fund board. Pensioners of the milk marketing board are somewhat in the dark about the way forward. They have formed a type of action group and have prepared a submission, which I know has been sent to the Minister. They have also corresponded with the chairman of the pension fund, who gave this undertaking in a reply dated 29 January:
<br><blockquote><p>"whatever organisational structure is put in place, the security of Pension Funds' assets will be maintained."</p></blockquote>
The Minister knows that pension issues are a lively subject of debate at the moment. Pensioners are concerned about a Maxwell being done to them and about the discussions that the Government are having on British Rail and British Coal pension funds. They are right to be concerned about their future because the milk marketing boards and their successors face important changes in the pension arena as well as in the milk and dairy industry. Pensioners suspect that they face a double whammy and they want to be consulted about the way forward.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will reassure pensioners that their views will count, that they, too, will be consulted, and that he can ensure that any future scheme matches pensioners' expectations, which are that the necessary funding arrangements will remain secure. At the moment, pensions are annually reviewed and linked with inflation. I hope, as I know that pensioners hope, that those practices and the benefits of the scheme will continue to exist. Pensioners of milk marketing board, in common with pensioners of many funds across the country, would like one other reasurrance—that they will be given a role in their own right on the boards of pension funds.<br><br>
We have had a debate about assets. I hope that the Minister will give all parties including pensioners, an opportunity to read full details. I hope that the necessary information will be disclosed. That will be a difficult task and I sympathise with the Minister. When I was a young man at university, there were concerns about the secret files that were held on all of us. I remember vividly colleagues of mine breaking into a room to search for secret files. If the files were not in that room, they broke into the next room, thinking that that must be where they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 101</span>
were. Eventually they found the secret files. However, they were convinced that, as has been suggested, a conspiracy of silence existed. I hope that the Minister will dissuade us from taking that view. He should come clean and give assurances that information about detail and not just principle will be available.</span></p>
<p>12.30</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Marland <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gloucestershire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There have been plenty of discussions already in the Committee about the revelation of further detail. My hon. Friend the Minister has made his position very clear. Amendment No. 72 is a probing amendment I would have withdrawn it, but as it has been tabled with the others, I should say a few words. I am satisfied that my hon. Friend the Minister has confirmed to the Committee that he will not allow any scheme to go ahead before he has had the opportunity to examine it in detail and satisfy himself that everything is fair and reasonable. Only on that basis will he allow any proposals to go ahead. I am happy to accept his reassurances on this matter, especially as some proposals may contain confidential, commercial information that the proposers of a scheme may not want everyone else to know.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) spoke about pensioners. It would be totally out of order not to take pensioners' interests into consideration. I have every confidence that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider that matter. I hope that tomorrow's pensioners and Opposition Members have taken serious account of Government proposals that every working man should establish his own pension fund so that the problems which the hon. Member for Sherwood was right to outline do not occur in future. There is considerable concern about pensioners who find themselves locked into a corporate pension scheme and are unable to remove their share of that scheme when they want to. The Government's sensible proposals would ensure that that problem would no longer arise and would provide that people could have their own independent pension funds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to speak briefly to amendment No. 109 to underline some points that have already been put to the Committee. I also want to make it clear that I hope very much that the Minister will not only give assurances but accept the amendment. I also hope that subsequently he will accept amendment No. 110. I am delighted to hear that the hon. Members for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Marland) and for Sherwood will support me if amendment No. 110 is pressed to a Division.<br><br>
It is important to recognise that, although the Committee is right to want to ensure that the 29,000 milk producers are fully consulted and their interests taken fully into account, 18,000 people could be affected by the pension provisions of the existing board and its associated companies. A total of 10,000 people are actual or deferred pensioners and a further 8,000 are staff contributors. That is a considerable number.<br><br>
If members of the Committee have meant what they said about the organisation and its staff having given real service and shown enormous skill, loyalty and dedication over many years and about their having helped the industry through difficult times in recent years, the least
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 102</span>
that we can do is to ensure at this vital moment that we make proper provision for their future in terms of pension arrangements.<br><br>
Pensioners are entitled to expect four things. First, they have a right to expect that the necessary funding arrangements will remain secure. That is basic. I may have been misinformed, but I think that the letter from the chairman of the board, to which the hon. Member for Sherwood referred, was dated 29 January 1992. Considerable time has lapsed since then and the situation has evolved. It is by no means clear that we are guaranteed success. In those circumstances, it is essential that the funding arrangements for the pension schemes—whether two pension schemes for Dairy Crest and Milk Marque or a combined one, whichever is the appropriate solution—are as secure as we can reasonably expect.<br><br>
Secondly, pensioners have a right to expect that the annual review linked to inflation will continue. I understand that that has been the practice in the past, although it has never been laid down. That is a reasonable expectation and I hope that the Minister will ensure not only that pensioners are consulted but that that remains a feature of the consultation.<br><br>
Thirdly, pensioners are entitled to expect that benefits funded by the boards will be maintained. Finally, pensioners should be accorded a role in the management of their affairs, as the hon. Member for Sherwood said. Those are reasonable expectations. If we mean what we have said about the skills and value contributed by the many people involved, it behoves us to give them some reassurance here and now.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two issues in the debate. The first is consultation and the second is the position of pensioners. I am sure that hon. Members have studied clause 3, the first part of which ensures that the board properly consults before proposing a scheme to the authority. The second part of the clause provides that the Minister must be certain that the scheme is acceptable. If it is not, clause 4 sets out what the Minister must do.<br><br>
If one considers all the consultation for which the Bill provides, it seems almost incredible that any hon. Member could expect more. The four boards must gain the approval of their members, who will closely examine the proposals. Subsequently, the Minister will go through the proposals with a fine comb having regard to all the requirements in the Bill. It seems unnecessary to include any more statutory consultees. If we require everyone in the industry to be consulted, we do not know how many people that will involve or in what detail they should be consulted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to bring to the Minister's attention a letter that I received from his colleague wih responsibility for occupational pensions. It was in response to a private Members' Bill that I promoted. The Government asked me not to pursue the matter because of the implications for the inquiry being carried out by Professor Goode. In the letter, the Under-Secretary told me that she accepted the principles behind that Bill, which were to protect occupational pension funds on the takeover or change or ownership of companies. In response to my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood and the hon. Member for North Cornwall, will the hon. Gentleman undertake to examine that commitment and find a way of including it in the Bill?</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not reached pensions but was still dealing with the generality of the detailed consultation. Having considered the matter carefully, my colleagues and I believe that there is sufficient opportunity for the board and for Ministers to consult so that every possible view, within reason, can be covered. There needs to be a qualification because an enormous number of people might believe that they had a right to be consulted if it were laid down in statute. We can consult without too much difficulty. We have to consider the overall features and bear in mind that there is limited time for consultation if we are to meet the date of 1 April 1994. I am talking not about a week or fortnight but about a considerable period which does not jeopardise the vesting date.<br><br>
I accept what the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said about pensioners. What will happen to the board and the fund is crucial to their futures. Responsibility for the fund lies between trustees and pensioners, not between pensioners and the Government as has been suggested. We are giving pensions a high priority and examining the situation carefully. We are prepared to table an amendment in the Committee as soon as possible to clarify beyond doubt the position of pensioners.<br><br>
We shall bear in mind what the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston said about his Bill and the assurance that he received from another Minister. In the light of what has happened in the past year or two, I want to emphasise that we must not leave pensioners feeling forgotten and in a position of uncertainty. I hope that the amendment will be withdrawn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tipping</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger <span class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke</span>)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 3, line 26, leave out "takes account of and insert "adversely affects".<br><br>
I noted what the Minister said about amendment No. 6 in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East. Amendment No. 10 would substitute similar wording. I shall be as brief as I can because I am sure that we want to make as much progress as possible.<br><br>
The industry's figures show that there is a deficit market in operation which will continue after vesting day. There is a shortage of milk. I shall address the problems of processors, although I may talk about the problems of producers if we manage to reach amendments Nos. 27 and 95. The shortage of milk means either that everyone goes a little short or that there is a significant reduction in milk sources for some individuals, organisations and companies.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The Government and the farming industry have tried to encourage diversification, one way of doing that, especially in grassland areas, is to add value to milk products. That applies to large dairy companies and to small cheese producers for example, who produce specialist cheeses with a high added value in a market which is rapidly expanding because, in the main, they are excellent products.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 104</span>
The problem is that the producers cannot obtain sufficient supplies of milk. On one side of the milk industry there is a reduction in doorstep deliveries, and at the same time the small, farmhouse producers of cheese would like a significant increase in their supplies. Mr. Leon Downey, who runs the Llangloffan farm in Castle Morris near Haverfordwest, is a specialist cheese producer. He wrote in September 1991 to the Secretary of State complaining that he could not increase his production and that that was directly affecting his business. He stated at his Llangloffan farm
<br><blockquote><p>"we maintain a small dairy herd purely for the purpose of organic farmhouse cheese production … The operation is self-contained and depends"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hill. I apologise for interrupting the hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger). I understood that we had already had a debate on clause stand part, as it were, with the aim of expediting consideration of the clause. We seem now to be going back over ground that we have already covered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Pembroke (Mr. Ainger) will have heard what has been said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as possible with my short quote from a long letter, with states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The operation is self-contained and depends on efficient marketing of a quality specialist product. The economics are, however, finely balanced and depend upon:
<ol>
<li>Our ability to produce our own milk</li>
<li>Revenue from visiting tourists</li>
<li>Sales to specialist retail and catering outlets.</li></ol>
A reduction in our quota directly affects our revenue from cheese sales. At the same time it constrains our ability to expand the tourism component of our business (in recent years visitor numbers have increased to 40,000 annually)."</p></blockquote>
This is the important part, and perhaps the Minister will listen.
<br><blockquote><p>"Visitors to the farm naturally wish to purchase samples of our product and their expectations ar disappointed if we are unable to supply, for several years we have tried to alleviate this problem by buying in farmhouse cheese from other local manufacturers. We are still unable to satisfy demand although we are taking the total production of some cheesemakers; and the latest quota cuts will reduce even this source of supply."</p></blockquote>
If quotas produce such problems, I fear that the muscle of the large purchasers of milk in the new unregulated market may exacerbate that already serious problem. That applies not only in my constituency but throughout grassland areas where there is diversification and the growth in employment that arises from niche-type food production, which is very successful. I hope that the Minister can assure us that when he considers the scheme to be put forward, he will also consider that issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Curry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that I can help the hon. Gentleman, who asked whether people would suffer from others having particular muscle under the new scheme. It is precisely the people who he cited who suffer from the organsiation of the existing scheme. We all want to encourage on-farm diversification and regional products, which are extremely popular. Small cheesemakers are dependent on allocation of supplies under the price hierarchy, end-use allocation system. In the new market, they will be able to bid frreely for supplies, enter into arrangements with other producers and explore all the means to ensure that they get those supplies. For them, the new market represents a liberalisation.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 105</span>
I accept that we are short of milk. The Government oppose cuts in quota for United Kingdom producers because we do not want to exacerbate the problem of supplies. I am sure that the hon. Member for Pembroke will recognise, and accept that I recognise, that one of the motives behind the reform is that innovation, especially quality innovation in the hands of small producers, has been choked at birth under the present arrangements. We need to give a new lease of life to the marketplace and I am sure that the proposals will assist in that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 3, line 27, after "and", insert "large and small".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take amendment No. 95, in page 3, line 27, after second "milk", insert ", in particular small producers".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When moving amendment No. 10, I said that I would mention the problems that producers, especially medium and small producers, could face under the new regime. Given the geography and the climate of the country, the majority of our milk is produced in the west and in upland areas where the prime grassland areas of Britain exist. It is also true, unfortunately—although in my case it is fortunate because I prefer to live in a non-urban environment—that many of those areas are a great distance from natural markets. To overcome that, the industry has developed, over many years, processing plants as close to production areas as possible. What concerns me and my hon. Friends is the possibility that the present arrangement for pooling prices, which, the milk marketing board assure us will continue under Milk Marque, may not be able to continue. Over many years, that arrangement has greatly benefited the small producer—the small upland farmer at a considerable distance from the dairy, not necessarily as the crow flies, but certainly by road.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tyler</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument with great interest and share some of his concerns, but why has he picked on size as the qualification requiring attention? Issues such as peripherality, Celtic language, upland areas or LFA-designated areas seem entirely appropriate to his argument. As I come from another Celtic country, I share his concern. If all producer interests are to be considered, size is not the only factor that should be taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainger</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but one of the problems is that, farms in upland areas tend to be small, which is why we tabled the amendment in the form in which it appears on the paper. Amendment No. 95 refers to "in particular
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 106</span>
small producers". We fear that if Milk Marque is unable to continue with a pooling arrangement it will have to consider economies of scale, and the small producer down a long lane, a long way from the dairy, will add considerable cost to collecting milk and bringing it back to the main plant. That is why amendment No. 95 refers to small producers in particular. I am aware that that may be a hypothetical case and that the milk marketing board has given assurances, but, certainly, in the south-west of England and in west Wales, there is a great deal of support for the concept of Milk Marque.<br><br>
There is security in numbers, and the areas to which I have referred are traditional milk producers, but they do not have the advantages of other areas, in which there is a choice of processors who may be interested in their product. There is the reservation that there may come a time when the pooling arrangement will have to end for the economic reasons put forward by Milk Marque. If that happens, the producers involved will suddenly be faced with a serious situation in which the benefit that they currently enjoy, and will enjoy immediately after vesting day, could disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Hector Munro</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the thought behind the amendment. After all, it goes back to the 1930s when it was the key issue to the small producer, who took two or three cans down to the railway station and tried to sell them. That was how the board took over collection and developed it right through to the present day tankers. The intervention of the hon. Member for North Cornwall raised the question of where to draw the fine in distinguishing one type of producer from another. All of us who are interested in the issue should appreciate the enthusiasm of the boards and the individual companies that are competing for milk, which is in short supply, in saying that they will collect milk from all producers. Everyone seems to suggest tha there will be no problem in organising collection. I suppose that it is conceivable that there may be a collection charge for the most remote dairy farms, but, in general, there will be no difficulty in ensuring that any milk produced will be taken to the creameries or for liquid distribution. The authority—the Ministers—will not accede to a scheme that does not treat fairly the small producer. I assure the hon. Gentleman that that will be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Recognising the difficulties in going through the usual channels, I wonder whether we might be able to tie over consideration of the amendment until our next sitting. An organisation outside the House of Commons may want to being certain matters to our attention, which we should deal with during our discussion of the amendment—</span></p>
