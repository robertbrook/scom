</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of three of the four amendments is to delay the abolition of wages councils until an inquiry into the possible effects of abolition has been conducted and its results reported to Parliament and accepted by Parliament. If the Government insist on abolishing wages councils without ascertaining the likely effects, they should at least have to report annually to Parliament on what the effects have been. The fourth amendment would require them to so so. It is difficult to believe that the Minister will oppose any of the amendments, especially amendment No. 223. It is now eight years since 1984, when the motto was that ignorance is strength, although its cogency has lasted longer than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to put a few facts on the record. Wage councils set minimum wages for 2,590,000 people—almost 2,600,000 people. Abolition of wages
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
councils will attack the standard of living and is likely to diminish the standard of living of 2,600,000 of our fellow citizens and their families. That seems to be a second front which the Department of Employment is opening up against working people. Not content with throwing just short of 3 million people on the dole—that is only the official figure—the Government are now determined to undermine the living standards of more than 2.5 million people who are still in work. The number of unemployed and those who are covered by wages councils orders totals 5.5 million people. That figure is equal to one quarter of the number of employees in this country. The number of people whom the Government have either thrown on the dole or whose wages they propose to reduce is equivalent to a quarter of all employees in Britain. Wages councils represent approximately one in eight of the work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one from the news media is present to report our debate. It is extraordinary that television, radio and most newspapers cannot find time to report what is happening to the wages of 2.5 million people but that they can devote a lot of time to reporting daft rubbish about scandals—or non-scandals. The scandal is that these matters should be their priority. That is why so many people think that something should be done about the news media.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of the one in eight employees who work in industries covered by wages councils, more than half of them work in retailing and 40 per cent. are employed in hotels and catering. Even with the help of wages councils, it must be stressed that those people are not particularly well paid. Their pay ranges from the princely, or unprincely, sum of £2.59 an hour to £3.10 an hour—scarcely anyone's ransom. However, it is important to point out that that rate is not the maximum that is set but the minimum. Employers can pay more than the minimum if they want to. There is no restraint on employers who want to increase the pay of employees in industries covered by wages councils above the recommended level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's justifications for abolishing wages councils is that about two thirds of people employed in wages council industries are already paid more than that minimum rate. Like many things for which the Government have claimed credit, that was always the case. In the debate in the House in 1908 about the setting up of wages councils, Winston Churchill acknowledged that most employers were paying more than the rate that the wages councils were likely to set. As there is no restriction on bonus payments or additional payments, it is clear that the only possible purpose for abolishing wages council minimum rates must be to enable people to pay less than those rates. We believe that all the evidence confirms our view that the effect of abolishing wages councils will be to reduce wages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to give examples that support our case. The wages council rate for shopworkers in London is £3.06 an hour. For technical reasons, some chemist shops are excluded from that category. Research by the Low Pay Unit in London shows that shop assistant jobs in chemists are being advertised at about £2.50 an hour—50p or more lower than the rate for non-chemist shops next door, covered by wages councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wages councils used to cover young people under 21. That cover was taken away by the Wages Act 1986. Since then, and more than once, the Greater Manchester low pay unit has conducted surveys into what has happened to the pay of young people in Greater Manchester. Its latest survey was conducted in 1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
The Minister shakes his head. I do not know whether he has something wrong with his ears or whether he is trying to disagree with what I am saying. Is he saying that the Greater Manchester low pay unit did not carry out the survey? I have not even told him the results of that survey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know what it said. No doubt the hon. Gentleman would like to tell the Committee how the low pay unit conducted that survey and what the size of the sample was.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hartley Booth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are dying to hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Conservative Members are dying to hear. From a large sample of 16 and 17-year-olds taken from the general Greater Manchester area, the low pay unit investigated their pay levels, comparing them with the pay levels that would have prevailed had the wages councils rates for under-21s been maintained. It found that all the 17-year-olds and 91 per cent. of the 16-year-olds were being paid less than the rate that would have been set by the wages councils. The average rate of pay of 17-year-olds in hairdressing was 74 per cent. of the wages council rate, 78 per cent. among shopworkers and 71 per cent. in catering. The Government counter that with the new earnings survey, but that survey relates to people who pay tax. Of the young people included in the Greater Manchester survey, 92 per cent. were earning too little to pay tax, so they were excluded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Robert Spink 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not sad that we have lost the old-fashioned apprenticeship in this country? In Germany and other countries, the training of young people is still comparatively, very good. Is not that because, in Britain, young people attract a high percentage of the adult wage, whereas in Germany, for example, young people attract a much lower percentage of the adult wage? Therefore, systems can price young people out of training and out of jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the great old myths of the 1970s and 1980s has just been churned out for the 1990s. The hon. Gentleman should explain why almost every apprenticeship disappeared in the 1980s and why more, rather than fewer, young people are out of work. If what he said made sense, those young people should be in work, but during the Government's period in office—almost 14 years now—they have never, on any single day, month or year, found a job for every school leaver, as used to happen when apprenticeships were widespread.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Spellar 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not also a fact that, in several industries, the ratio of the wage rates of apprentices to the adult skilled rates has declined in recent years? Furthermore, because of the economic and training policies of the Conservative party, the number of apprenticeships has declined dramatically, to the extent that, if there is any recovery, there is a serious danger that there will be a chronic shortage of skilled workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think that we are in danger of wandering too far from the main point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever, Mr. Knox, I am being dragged out of order by Conservative Members. I do try to keep in order, as you know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition argue that a reduction of pay generally is bad enough, but the provisions will have a differentially bad effect on women. Women will be hit hardest by the abolition of wages councils for two reasons. As far as I can discover, no one is sure precisely how many members of work forces covered by wages councils are women. Estimates vary at between two thirds and three quarters. To abolish them will therefore have a disproportionate effect on women, because so many women are employed in those industries. Yet this is the work of a Secretary of State for Employment, who is, allegedly, responsible for promoting equal opportunities for women. As we have said time and time again, the equal opportunity that she offers in the provision is to allow 2 million women to be paid less than the amount that they are currently paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Thomas Graham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be aware that, at present, I have people visiting every jobcentre in my constituency and finding out what wages are on offer. This morning I received a phone call, when I was told that in several areas it looks as though the Government are advertising jobs at wages below the rates recognised by the wages councils. I am awaiting confirmation. I have also been informed that most of those cases relate to women's pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pretty sure that my hon. Friend is right. We all know that the previous Prime Minister referred constantly to the rule of law, which was, by and large, that she laid down the law and everybody else obeyed it. [Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Yes, indeed, even those of us who are not lawyers know that the rule of law, before she appeared on the scene and started to redefine it, was the concept whereby the citizen was protected from the arbitrary activities of Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have found, over the past few years, that the Government have scarcely been uniform in their enthusiasm for applying the law. They have not devoted many resources to applying the law on wages councils. They have discovered many wrongdoers, most of whom have not been prosecuted, but they have reduced considerably the number of people who are supposed to carry out that task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government also appear, from reports that we have received, to allow their jobcentres to advertise jobs at rates below the wages councils minima. We do not believe that taxpayer's money should be used to aid and abet lawbreakers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman finishes speaking about the effect of the abolition of wages councils on wage levels, I should like to refer to the recent information which he gave on the effect of removing young people from the scope of wages councils. Will he comment on the fact that the survey published in the 	<i>Employment Gazette</i> this month states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Between 1986 and 1992 the gross weekly pay of young males and females grew by over two-fifths in each of the main wages council trades,"?</p></blockquote>
Does not that demolish the hon. Gentleman's argument?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that statistic was taken from the new earnings survey and, therefore, excludes by definition many of the worst-paid people. If those people are left out, such a conclusion can be reached. Other conclusions could have been reached but the researchers did not pay attention to those because they did not make the Government's case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In addition to explaining the pitfalls in the new earnings survey, perhaps my hon. Friend wuld reflect on the fact that the Minister was selective when he referred to that survey. His hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Dr. Spink) mentioned the pay of young people in relation to adults. Will my hon. Friend comment on the findings of the new earnings survey, which showed that the pay of young people over 21 has decreased by 4.6 per cent. in hotels and catering, by 1.1 per cent. in retail distribution and by 2.8 per cent. in all industries?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend's points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) cannot slide off by saying that people who work part time did not come within the scope of the survey. He mentioned sales assistants. The survey shows between 1986 and 1992 that the pay of full-time male sales assistants aged under 21 increased by 55 per cent., in gross terms. In hotels and catering, the increase was 41.6 per cent. and in retail distribution the increase was 57.2 per cent. Their pay has increased. The hon. Gentleman should stop wriggling and admit it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not wriggling. Even the incomplete figures presented by the Minister, who will have to seek confirmation of this, show that an increase or improvement took place at the beginning of the period, when there was what might be described as a deficit of people in that age group. Since then, the position has worsened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend also explain to the Minister that it is not a question of excluding full-time or part-time workers, but that those who were excluded earn less than the minimum threshold for paying income tax? Many of those not paying income tax work full time for more than 40 hours a week. This has nothing to do with whether people work full time or part time. The survey excluded the many thousands who are paid such poverty wages that even if they work 46 or 50 hours a week they still do not reach the threshold for paying income tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. That is what I said, albeit more briefly than my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden), who spelt it out for Conservative Members who could not understand what I was saying because I was being so brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just general reductions in wage rates that make what is going on, and what is likely to happen, objectionable. To use the Equal Opportunity Commission's word, wages council rates are unisex. The same hourly wage rate is applied to men and women and to part-time and full-time workers. As a result, the wages
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
councils have played a positive role in reducing pay discrimination between the sexes in the industries to which they apply. The differential between men's pay and women's pay in wages council industries is lower than in other employment sectors. Therefore, the differential is likely to increase because of the Bill. The Secretary of State claims to be responsible for promoting equal opportunities. To remove legislation which has achieved a reduction in the wage gender gap and not to replace it, will increase the pay gap between the sexes. That is an odd way to promote equal opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the new earnings survey—not the article, which the Government commissioned at the taxpayers' expense for the 	<i>Employment Gazette</i>—the statistics show that the gender gap in pay for young people under 21 has grown since wages councils were abolished. That survey was not drawn to the attention of those members of the public who read the article in the 	<i>Employment Gazette.</i> That would have been embarrassing for the Government. It would have run contrary to their approach—that public documents and public servants must devote most of their time to promoting the Government's interests rather than to telling the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another Government retort is that women work in wages council industries for pin money. Nobody else believes that. For a start, 58 per cent. of wages council workers work full time and many of the women who work part time desperately need the money that they earn for themselves and for their families. My hon. Friends will deal with that point in more detail. I do not want to go on for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of abolishing wages councils will bear more heavily on black and Asian workers than on white workers. Twelve per cent. of the whole work force and about 25 per cent. of the black and Asian work force are employed in wages council industries. Black and Asian workers will suffer disproportionately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation will harm not only low-paid men and women and their families but local communities, especially those in low-pay areas. If pay is cut, there will be less spending power in the locality. We all know, since no one would deny it—even with the assistance of articles in the 	<i>Employment Gazette</i>—that the low paid generally buy locally and tend to buy British.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a letter relevant to my hon. Friend's point from my local borough council—Rhuddlan borough council, which is not Labour controlled. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Within an area so dependent on the tourism industry"—</p></blockquote>
such as mine—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the retention of the Wages Council rates for the hotel and catering sector in particular is considered vital to the future of the local economy."</p></blockquote>
That authority is Conservative controlled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. We must recognise that there are people in the Conservative party—albeit not in this Room—who care about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Nicholls 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not at this moment. The abolition of wages councils is not just mean minded and harmful to

	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
individuals; it will worsen the cycle of deprivation in areas of low pay. The Government say that the best way to get the economy going is to raise spending power—that seems to be the main thrust of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's arguments at the moment. To set about reducing the spending power of 2.5 million workers by law is a curious way of helping Britain to get out of recession. I will now give way to the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that a forthcoming Labour Government would reverse the abolition of wages councils and restore them to those industries? As he thinks that he has made a powerful case for restoring them, will he confirm that they will be brought back for all those industries.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having answered that question twice or three times in the House, the hon. Gentleman's question does not pose any real problems. First, the next Labour Government will introduce a national minimum wage. That will be our first priority. We also recognise that there may still be problems in particular "sweated trades", as they were called by the most distinguished person ever to lead the Tory party when he was introducing wages councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He was a Liberal at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, he was. That just shows how the Tories claim credit for everything. They claim credit for Winston Churchill who, as the hon. Gentleman points out, was a Liberal at the relevant time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat, so that no one is in any doubt, that the next Labour Government will introduce a national minimum wage. The rate set will be higher than any of the minimum wage rates presently set by wages councils, or any projected from the present rates. Then, together with people concerned with low pay and those in industries with particular difficulties, we shall consider the introduction of special measures to protect people who are not entirely protected by the national minimum wage. When we have sorted out what is needed, we shall introduce it. We shall have sorted it out before the next election. That response ought to be sufficient for the Secretary of State to stop sending misleading letters on the subject to members of the public and—more objectionably—authorising her civil servants to he about Labour party policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman has said about the effect on the labour market. Would he comment on the Fabian Society analysis of the policy that he has explained, which is that it would result in the loss of 880,000 jobs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the people who produced the Fabian pamphlet were wrong. It is as simple as that. Does the Minister agree with every pamphlet produced by every Tory? If not, why should I have to agree with every pamphlet produced by people associated with the Labour party?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Phillips and Drew and many other respected sources. If the hon. Gentleman's only response is, "I don't agree", the position of people whose jobs might be threatened by his rather silly policies is not very secure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we are here to debate the merits of a national minimum wage. If the Government want to give a day or half a day of their time on the Floor of the House, we shall be happy to have a full-scale debate about the minimum wage. We think that it is right, and that grotesque exaggerations have been put forward by opponents of a national minimum wage, some of whom oppose it on principle. There are even some on the left of the political spectrum who oppose it on principle. I can argue with people's principles and say that I do not share their principles on that matter. It is not just an argument about the figures. A national minimum wage would not solve all the problems of low pay and poverty, but it would be a substantial step down the road. It would bring us into line with most other members of the European Community, who have some form of minimum wage law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman aware that, in a survey that I carried out during the summer at the jobcentre in Whitby in my constituency, I discovered that 100 per cent. of the jobs advertised would pay less than the Labour party's proposed minimum wage?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come to a point that is related to the comment by the hon. Member for Scarborough (Mr. Sykes). The other thing that the Government have left out of their equation is that few people expect human beings to live on some of the lousy pay rates that apply in the United Kingdom. They expect the taxpayer to make up some of the shortfall from the employer. The Government have some explaining to do about the Bill. The abolition of wages councils and the reduction in wages that will surely follow—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not know what point I am trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The drop in wages is bound to lead to costs for the taxpayer. For a start, if people's pay comes down, they will generally pay less tax. Secondly, some will be entitled to more benefits to make up for their reduced pay. I do not suggest that the cost to the taxpayer will be as large as the £9,000 per person per year that it costs the taxpayer to keep someone out of work, but there will be a cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If people currently pay tax and their pay goes down, they will pay less. Some are already entitled to some level of some benefits, and if their pay drops, they will be entitled to more benefits met by the taxpayer. Others who
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0671">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
are not at present entitled to benefits will be entitled to benefits—family credit, housing benefit and others—which will impose a cost on the taxpayer. That is bound to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it extraordinary that, in the section on the financial effects of the Bill, the Government say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill is estimated to give rise to an overall net saving to public funds."</p></blockquote>
When we asked the Department of Social Security whether it had made any estimate of the likely impact on benefits, it said that it had not. So that statement about the financial effects of the Bill is a plain lie. We all know that it will cost the taxpayer a great deal of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman comment on two points? First, when the Labour Government abolished 11 wages councils covering 600,000 workers wages did not drop. Secondly, when young people were taken out of the wages council regime, wages did not drop. In taking into account any analysis of the figures, it is necessary to bear in mind the fact that more jobs would be created if the wages councils were abolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are back to legislating by assertion. First, when the Labour Government abolished those 11 wages councils, it was at the request of those representing people covered by them. For good or ill, that was the case. They argued that because of the success of collective bargaining—something else to which Conservative Members object on principle; they are removing it from the duties of ACAS—wages were generally above the levels set by those wages councils and would continue to rise. Secondly, there is no evidence that that applies to wages councils at present: we have discerned no demand for their abolition from anyone covered by them. We have already discussed what happened when wages council protection was taken away from young people and we disagree about the conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but is it not true that the only reason why the Labour party's position on wages councils has changed since it was in government is that the trade unions' position has changed? Trade unions were opposed to wages councils when there was a Labour Government because they saw them as competitors and a threat to collective bargaining. Now that unions are so weak, they want to sit on wages councils to set wage rates because they can no longer attract more members. Is not that why the hon. Gentleman finds himself in this absurd position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the first time that I have heard the Minister admit that one of the objectives of the Tory party was to so weaken trade unions that people would receive less pay than they would have received if unions had been able to help them. That is useful confirmation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I try to be reasonably honest about these matters and I acknowledge that some people in the trade union movement do not like wages councils on principle, but I disagree with them and so does the Labour party. That is why we are making our point. The history of the abolition of those 11 wages councils shows that considerable doubts about the wisdom of that action were expressed by Labour Ministers at the time. However, they were finally convinced by the argument that collective bargaining was
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
raising pay well above wages council rates and would continue to do so. No one is suggesting that there are not people in the Labour movement who object to wages councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Spink</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we move away from the Labour Government's abolition of wages councils, will the hon. Gentleman clarify something for me? Is it not a fact that when they did so, they did not bring the issue to the House of Commons for debate but abolished them by orders? For example, the Boot and Floor Polish, Stamped or Pressed Metal-Wares, Paper Box, Milk Distribution (Scotland) and Road Haulage Councils were all abolished without any debate in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If those councils were abolished by order, I can only assume that no Member of the House objected. Had there been any objections, a debate would have been bound to follow. In a sense, I am at a loss. I do not know what happened at that time, but, as everyone knows, if there was no debate on the issue it must have meant that nobody objected to the orders that brought about the change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take my hon. Friend back to the origins of the trade boards and the wages councils? I remind him that one element stressed at the time by some, including Winston Churchill, was that they were needed because of the lack of organisation in those industries. Churchill said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"where you have no organisation, no parity of bargaining, the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad employer is undercut by the worst".</p></blockquote>
In the road haulage industry at that time, there was, by agreement, parity of bargaining. The conditions laid down by the founding father and leading figure, Winston Churchill, were fulfilled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People were convinced, including everyone in the House of Commons—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal will create a massive cost to the taxpayer, not just to employees. It is startling that they have made no estimate of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the wide opposition to the proposed abolition. During the 1988 consultations employers in industries covered by wages councils were evenly divided between abolition and retention. More employers in industries not covered by wages councils were in favour of abolition, but the overwhelming majority of representations was against abolition, especially those from organisations concerned with the interests of the badly paid and the promotion of equal opportunities for women. A sample of the organisations which are opposed to the Government's proposal includes the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Low Pay Unit, the Fawcett Society, the National Federation of Fish Fryers Ltd., the Scottish Licensed Trade Association, the Retail Confectioners and Tobacconists Association Ltd., the Religious Society of Friends, the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Council of Women of Great

Britain. We wanted to know who was in favour of abolition. We asked the Secretary of State to publish the representations that she has received, but she will not do so. Who are the Scrooges who will not speak their name, or are too many of the letters along the lines of, "Thank you for deciding to abolish wages councils; also enclosed is a cheque for Tory party funds"? Is that the embarrassment that the Secretary of State wants to keep quiet?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the hon. Member for Castle Point claim that abolition will create jobs. It is a bit rich for the Government to talk of creating jobs. Their forte until now has been job destruction. They claimed that abolition would help to create jobs for young people, but the employment situation for young people is the worst that it has ever been. The Wages Act 1986 was intended to increase and improve employment opportunities for young people, yet more young people are not working now than ever before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to young people and unemployment.

I do not know whether the Minister can tell us the latest position, but the Secretary of State told my predecessor as Opposition spokesman on Employment—my hon.

It must be emphasised that since the Conservative Government took office in 1979 there has never been a year when they have found jobs for all school leavers, not even during the Lawson boom or the period when the BBC used to refer to Britain's economic miracle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have produced a list of 26 studies of the job creation aspects of lower wages. The list is remarkable because it does not justify the Government's statement and it contains some omissions. I shall not detain the Committee by quoting tediously from most of those reports, but one report commissioned by the Government stated that there were
	<br><blockquote><p>"no adverse employment effects from the activities of wages councils".</p></blockquote>
That report was strangely omitted from the list of texts that the Committee had to study. The Institute of Personnel Management has recently reported:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no evidence that up to 1986 wages councils had significant effects on employment, or that the (1986) reforms stimulated employment".</p></blockquote>
I do not think, therefore, that the Government can make such a claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are pursuing a strange policy. They suggest that, in some way or another, if people are paid less, the country will become more prosperous. All the evidence suggests that high wages are associated with prosperity and low wages with poverty. The sooner we become a high-wage economy, the better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not share the Government's belief that wages councils place a terrible burden on business. We have explained that businesses can pay higher rates. If the wages council rate is the problem, abolition does not get rid of it but only shifts it from the employer to the employee and taxpayer. That transfers the problem but does not get rid of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Evidence from other companies shows that a nationally set rate can be advantageous to some, especially small and medium-sized businesses. At least everyone knows what the going rate is and people do not have to devote
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0673">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
time to arguing about it. That is one reason why some people in the trade union movement are not keen on wages councils, which lay down a set rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A survey by Incomes Data Services Ltd. is probably best summarised by the heading on its press release:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Employers split on future of wages councils"</p></blockquote>
The Government have not proved the case for the abolition of wages councils, which will lead to lower wages, have damaging effects on women and widen the gender gap on pay. The whole thing stinks of hypocrisy when well-paid bosses advocate pay cuts for their very low-paid staff. The stink of hypocrisy is worse when we discover how close the links are between some of those companies and the funding of the Tory party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Joyce Quin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend mentioned the views of different employers and the fact that often when wages drop the taxpayer has to pick up the bill by paying subsidies and benefits, to which low-paid workers become entitled. But might not some good employers think that poor employers are being given a competitive advantage by those subsidies which help them to continue unfair practices?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friend talked about the financial effects of the abolition of wages councils, I noticed that he was interrupted several times by Conservative Members raising irrelevant matters. I hope that that will not stop the Minister from giving the Committee a full explanation of how the dubious figure of £2.8 million a year was reached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point is that this matter is not localised in any particular city, region or country in the United Kingdom. Many people work in wages councils industries throughout the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The predominant industries vary from region to region, but, as I said at the outset, retailing is the main sphere; hotels and catering, hairdressing and the rag trade come next. Jobs in those industries are notoriously badly paid even with wages councils. They include many vulnerable groups and, in particular, vulnerable women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As wages councils cover only about 10 per cent. of the labour force, why are not industries such as the security and cleaning industries, which are not covered by wages councils effected in the way that the hon. Gentleman described? In those industries, wholesale numbers of employees have not become dependent on the benefit system. The greatest determinant of the size of a family credit award is the number and ages of the children rather than wage levels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never thought that I would live to see the day that a Tory Minister would hold up the security industry as an example of the fine rates of pay that result from the absence of wages councils. I am told by one of my hon. Friends, who cannot be here this morning, that he saw an advertisement for security officers offering £1.50 per hour, bring your own dog—[	<i>Laughter.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a cousin who worked in that industry for Reliance Security Services Ltd. Three years ago, he was paid the princely sum of £2.01p an hour, for which he was expected to work
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
18-hour days seven days a week. That pay has now reached the princely sum of £2.30p an hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept entirely what my hon. Friend said. The security industry is probably the most notorious bad payer of the lot. I am surprised by what the Minister said. He said that the principal determinant of entitlement to and level of family credit is the number and age of children in the family. That is true, but it is not the only determining factor. In part, the level of family credit, like other benefits, is related to people's income. People are entitled to more benefits if their pay decreases. I am not suggesting for a minute that that would make up the difference. It would help, but it would be at the expense of the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We regard the Government's proposals as a shameful episode in even the history of the Tory party. Above all, we do not believe that the Government are entitled to take a leap in the dark. We do not object to Minister's taking a leap in the dark, but we do not think that they are entitled to hold hands with 2.6 million people when they do it because Ministers will not suffer the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need for studies to be carried out that will be broadly agreed on. If the Minister challenges some of the studies provided by those concerned about low pay, that is okay, but we challenge some of the Government's studies. Even though they have not produced many, they have pleaded in evidence one or two of them, which is not satisfactory. The Government need to produce a report on the likely consequences of their proposal and, if they go ahead with their proposal, they should be under an obligation to publish annual reports on the consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposal would be an enormous step. It would affect one in eight of all employees. On Second Reading, I said that Churchill set up and strengthened the wages councils; Thatcher retained them; Major is abolishing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman must not refer to the Prime Minister by name, although he can refer to the others by name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
We oppose the abolition of wages councils. It would be harmful to the many badly paid people and to those covered by wages councils, who are mainly women. It would widen the wages gap between men and women, would place a burden on the taxpayer, and would be a thoroughly reprehensible move. We shall continue to oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that this is one of those relatively rare occasions when the Committee agrees on what we want to achieve and we disagree only about the means—although we shall disagree about that fundamentally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras made a powerful case that the position of the low paid would be made worse by the proposal and by the rejection of his amendment. He made a long speech. In his last few words, he summed up the debate and gave us the material from which we will have to judge the amendments. He believes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0674">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
that the proposal would be thoroughly bad for the low paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman talked about why the amendments should be accepted and the proposal should be rejected, he referred to 1908 and quoted Winston Churchill. It may be the cynic in me but I always get worried when I hear Labour politicians, almost with tears in their eyes and a gulp in their throats, talking about old Winston and what a marvellous chap he was. As far as I can remember, the only time that the villain of Gallipoli, who was rejected in 1945, is referred to in that way, is when we discuss wages councils. Continuity in history is fine and, as a Conservative, I tend to follow that path, but I think that I would get a degree of rhubarb or even the bird if I were to say, either in Committee or on the Floor of the House, that social policy has not progressed since 1908. The claim that a social policy that was good enough in 1908 must be good enough today is bizarre in the extreme. I am not convinced that a policy must be right as we approach the 21st century because Winston Churchill introduced it eight years after the turn of this century. That is not a convincing argument for the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman should be able to look up examples for himself without using me as his research assistant.

The question is low pay or no job, and the amendments stand or fall on the basis of whether they are likely to create work. Neither a Conservative nor a Labour Government have any expertise of telling an employer what he can afford to pay. An employer will offer a wage which he can afford to pay and which is sufficient to attract someone to do the work competently. If either of those ingredients is absent, as would be the case in a wages council structure, the job will go.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Terry Rooney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bradford, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the ultimate payer of local authority workers is the taxpayer. The Government raise tax from the taxpayers and, ultimately, it must be the Government who decide what they can afford to pay. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for supporting the proposition that I outlined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras is giving the impression that once a person is on low pay, he is locked there for ever. Hon. Members know from experience of life and their constituency postbags that some people at the bottom of the labour market will never rise; they do not have sufficient talents to earn the salary that we should like them to earn. We must have the combination of ensuring that the economy produces jobs and ensuring that there is a proper system of in-work benefits to look after such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people may be at the bottom of the labour market, but many others are simply passing through it. Surely members of the Committee, certainly Conservative Members, have worked for wages that were so low that they would have been covered by low-pay statistics. But that position does not last for ever. I refer to the many people who are on low wages—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I include Ministers. People may go through a period in which they are on low pay, but the fact that they are in work makes it much easier for them to obtain other work. People who have been unemployed know that it is desperately hard to obtain a first job. If a person is looking to better himself and already has a job, it is much easier for him to change jobs. Many categories of jobs would be extinguished if the amendment were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman describe some of those categories?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are all sorts of categories. If a person starts his working life in the catering industry,

he may earn a wage that is covered by a wages council resolution. There is nothing to stop a person progressing through that industry. Recently, I met the chief executive of McDonald's in the United Kingdom. That firm features highly in Labour party demonology. He started his working life as a crew member in a galley in McDonald's. I accept that not every crew worker in McDonald's will wind up as a chief executive, but that person was able to start himself on the ladder by being in a low-paid job. Such examples exist throughout a market economy, yet the hon. Gentleman does not want to hear about market economics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat my request. Will the hon. Gentleman describe the categories of jobs that will be wiped out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough referred to several jobs in various industries that were advertised in his local labour exchange for which the wages being offered were less than wages council minima. If people were not able to apply for such jobs so that they could progress in future, they would have no start in life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that in addition to pricing people out of work, there is a job-destroying aspect to wages councils? They may increase rates of pay above inflation which, to maintain differentials, means that wages further up the scale must increase beyond what an employer can pay. That results not only in low-paid employees, but in others losing then-jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholls</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. When a Government with no expertise intervene in the labour market and tell business men what they can afford to pay, the entire system is distorted. In response to the question whether he would restore wages councils, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that he would not, and that the matter would be dealt with by way of a minimum wage. That was an honest and brave statement; it was the only possible answer that he could have given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one who has any credibility believes that a national minimum wage will bring about what it is claimed it will bring about. Let us consider those in the Labour party who think deeply and those who are incapable of thought. The hon. Member for Birkenhead is one of the foremost thinkers in the Labour movement.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite people's aspirations, the evidence is that wages councils are not good for the low paid. They destroy job opportunities that the low paid might otherwise have. They are not about engendering hope, but about killing it. It is all too easy to say that because wages councils seem like a good idea, they must be a good idea. The ultimate test of whether one cares about the low paid and the non-paid is this: is one prepared to ask whether wages councils are any good for the low paid? The wages councils do not fulfil their function. The Government can be criticised only for not having abolished them before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment for several reasons, not least of which is that social implications arise for the millions who depend on the wages councils for their level of income. We need to assess that help before we can proceed. I believe that the evidence shows that wages councils meet the requirements outlined by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. Equally, a further examination must be made of the financial implications of the abolition of wages councils for the Exchequer. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) said, the figure of £1.8 million cited in the Bill is a serious underestimate of the consequences of the aboliton of wages councils.

Our case is right and just. A detailed examination of employers and employees, together with the views of organisations such as the Equal Opportunities Commission, would bear out our argument that wages councils are important to many millions of people. Throughout our discussion of the Bill we have spoken about rights. The Opposition have often disagreed with the Government's stance, but at least we have been talking about the rights of individuals, such as the improvement of maternity rights or of the rights of individual trade unionists. Now we are speaking of the removal of the rights of 2.6 million people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head, but I shall expand on my argument in due course and show that those rights are to be removed, which will have a detrimental effect on many millions of people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. I fought the general election in my constituency solely on the issue of the minimum wage. It will not have escaped the notice of Conservative Members that I, with some of my hon. Friends, took seats from the Conservative party. We are proud to say that we would introduce a minimum wage of about £3.40 to £3.50 per hour, at current rates. That should be taken as a clear statement of our stance by those hon. Members who tell us that wages councils were abolished by a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By supporting the amendments, we are defending the last vestiges of protection and pay regulation. It may have escaped the attention of Conservative members of the Committee that we are doing so not only for the 2.7 million workers who are covered by wages councils, but because it is evident to those who take an interest in such matters that, despite what has been said and despite 14 years of Tory Government, Britain remains a low-paid country with a low-pay economy. There are 6 million women workers whose earnings are below the European decency threshold. Twelve million people in Britain are on income support. There are 2.5 million to 2.6 million
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
workers covered by the councils that Conservative members of the Committee are trying to abolish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am the only member of the Committee who represents a constituency in Wales. My region has the lowest pay rates in the United Kingdom—87 per cent. of the national average wage. Nothing that is to be proposed this morning will help to improve those figures or the lot of people facing poverty in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Wales 109,500 workers will be adversely affected by the abolition of wages councils. That is more than one in 10 of the households in Wales. If wages fell by just 20p per hour for those 109,500 people in my region, it is estimated that there would be a loss of almost £400,000 per week in income to people in Wales. That equates to £20 million a year in loss of spending power in Wales, which is already the lowest paid region in the United Kingdom. I should like to hear the Government defend that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras so ably pointed out, the people who will lose out—such as those in my constituency, in Flint, Holywell and Prestatyn, many of whom work in low-paid industries and in tourism and depend on wages council incomes—do not suck in foreign imports. They do not go out and buy Gucci shoes or an Alfa Romeo. They do not often take holidays abroad; they holiday in the constituency of the hon. Member for Scarborough, in Bridlington and in other British tourist resorts. They spend their money in the corner shop; they buy food locally; they boost the local economy and the economy of this country. If the wages of my constitutents are reduced, the spending power in my area will be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I mentioned earlier, when intervening on my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras, Rhuddlan borough council, which covers half my constituency, has written to me to explain its concern about the abolition of wages councils. The town of Prestatyn, which is highly dependent on the tourism industry, is in that council's area. As I mentioned, the council is not Labour controlled, yet concern was expressed about the proposals at its industrial development committee meeting on 14 December. The letter says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Concern was expressed as to the impact this would have upon the local economy and those persons employed particularly within the service sectors within Rhuddlan … Far from improving the competitiveness of local businesses, it is argued that the abolition would directly lead to a drop in standards and quality of services within this sector."</p></blockquote>
The council believes that that loss of spending power within the local economy will have a knock-on effect on unemployment in the borough. That is the view of a non-Labour-controlled authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, 10 per cent. of all men in manual work covered by wages councils earn less than £114 per week; 10 per cent. of all women earn less than £94 per week. My hon. Friends have presented clear evidence that the removal of wages councils will force wages down even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Wages are important, but so are terms and conditions. I entered the House in April last year and first had experience of the operation of a wages council as a Member of Parliament in May, when the husband of a constitutent came to my surgery. My constituent was afraid to come herself) in case her employer found out. Her
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0677">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
husband said that she was being forced to work overtime, with only a few hours notice, at a hotel at a non-premium rate on Saturdays and Sundays when the hotel was busy. He asked whether she was entitled to a decent level of pay over the normal rate. I investigated the case and referred it to the wages councils inspectorate, which is to be abolished by the Bill. The inspectors told the hotel, "You must pay the premium rate for overtime set down by the wages council."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What redress will my constituent have if her employer says, at 11 o'clock on a Saturday night, "You must work until 2 am. We will not pay you overtime. If you don't like it, we're sorry, but many people in the employment market will be willing to take your job."? My constituent is not a member of a union, because the hotel company does not recognise unions. I suggest that she will have absolutely no redress. At the moment, at least, I can complain as a Member of Parliament to a wages council which can, as it did in that case, serve an order on the employer. I can raise the issue in the House and with the Minister. What redress will my constituent have under the free market that the Bill will create?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. DAVID KNOX 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>When the wages councils inspector went to the hotel and served an order on the hotel, it immediately issued every employee with a piece of paper that read: "I hereby waive my rights under the wages councils directive." That may not be legal, but that hotel pressurised its employees into signing away their rights. That will happen inceasingly in the near future. Good old Winston—let us forget Tonypandy and all the other things that he did; in this instance it is good old Winston—has been quoted on the matter, and will continue to be quoted, day in and day out, by Labour Members. In the absence ofa minimum wage, or wages councils, the bad employer will undercut the good employer. Respectable employers will be priced out of the market by others, who will not give a damn about their employees and the conditions in which they work.</p>
	<p>Current wages council rates are not what I would term a prince's ransom. Clothing manufacturing covers 147,000 people, which is one and a half times the number needed to fill Wembley stadium, and the current rate is £102.86 per week. Hairdressing undertakings covers 64,000 people at a rate of £111.20 per week. Licensed residential and licensed restaurant establishments covers 379,000 people at a rate of £109.20 per week.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will confirm to the Committee that two thirds of the people covered by wages councils are paid above the normal rate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are rather concerned about conditions in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. If the effect of setting wages above the levels that employers across the labour market can afford is to deny people jobs or to make them unemployed, that is surely the biggest source of poverty and lack of purchasing power in his constituency. The hon. Gentleman is considering only half the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister were to visit Delyn at the weekend, he could talk to many people who would tell that the principal causes of unemployment are the closure of British Steel and textile firms and the potential closure of pits. Minimum wages and wages councils are very low on the list of the causes of unemployment in Delyn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wages council rates are not great and the argument that their further reduction will create employment is disingenuous. It will reduce local spending power, so I look forward to hearing the Minister's explanation of how jobs will be created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will ask us to consider whether wages councils are relevant in Britain in the 1990s, whether abolishing them will not create jobs and whether they are of concern only to a few people. All of the arguments that you will put forward—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our evidence shows that women will be particularly affected by the abolition of wages councils. Currently, 6 million women in Britain earn less than the Council of Europe's decency threshold and women now lose at least £21 billion annually in wages as a result of sex bias in employment. Nothing that will be proposed today will redress that position. The pay gap between men and women is increasing and will continue to do so. We should be introducing legislation to change that As most of those covered by wages councils are women in low-paid, part-time or full-time employment, it is obvious that, if a reduction in pay is forced by the abolition of the wages councils, it will result in a fall in the income of women, who currently form a low-paid, non-unionised work force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the representations that Opposition Members have received from outside organisations support our amendments. The evidence submitted to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux by Flint citizens advice bureau in my constituency states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we are concerned that these matters will become even worse should the existing Wages Councils be abolished."</p></blockquote>
The Flint CAB is worried that that would increase the level of low pay and result in poor working conditions for people in the Flint area.

The National Council of Women of Great Britain states:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0678">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many find themselves exploited and defenceless, having no trade union to support them. We fear that if employers are free to suppress wages it will mean many women will be forced to work very long hours merely to make a living."</p></blockquote>
Those comments find an echo on the Opposition Benches. We support a delay in the implementation of the provision and we urge consideration of the employment and social consequences of abolition.

The Fawcett Society stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"minimum wage protection … is a safety net for the poorest and most vulnerable members of society. Abolition is a serious issue for over two million low paid women."</p></blockquote>
I would welcome some information from the Minister about the consultations on the abolition of wages councils. Recent consultations have shown that of the employers and employers' organisations that responded to consultations in 1988,60 per cent. were against abolition of the wages councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Institute of Management—I have not come across it before, but I assume that it does not represent low-paid workers—has written to all members of the Committee stating that it
	<br><blockquote><p>"is concerned that outright abolition of the councils will consign Britain to a low wage/low skill economy rather than a high wage/high skill one."</p></blockquote>
I should like to hear the Minister's response to that. Surely one of the aspirations of the Conservative Government is for a highly skilled, highly motivated, high-class work force who contribute to making Britain a competitive nation, not by reducing the wages of the lowest paid members of society but by creating a well-motivated, skilled and well-paid work force with spending power in the community who feel that they are part of the business in which they work and not just skivvies who happen to work in the business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Low Pay Unit suggested one of the key points contained in our submissions—that family credit will rise dramatically if wages councils are abolished. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Since Family Credit is only available to workers with dependent children, many people disadvantaged by abolition will be unable to claim, and this will mean a significant loss of spending power".</p></blockquote>
Evidence from several organisations shows that many more people will become eligible for family credit.

The Equal Opportunities Commission is sponsored by the Government and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said, supports the retention of wages councils. The United Kingdom Federation of Business and Professional Women stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are concerned about the proposal to abolish the remaining Wages Councils will adversely affect low paid workers, most of them women."</p></blockquote>
The 	<i>Financial Times,</i> which I do not read often caught my eye a week or so ago and strengthened our arguments when it stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in deciding now to abolish the Wages Councils the government is taking a risk. Attempting to reduce the wages of low paid workers at a time of depressed confidence, rising unemployment, and with the public sense of injustice already aroused by the miners debacle"—</p></blockquote>
We all say "Hear, hear" to that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is not the most politic of actions … In any case the evidence does not suggest that the low levels of pay set by the wages councils have a significant negative employment effect, as the government claim …
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
By reducing the spending power of those people most likely to spend their wages on goods produced in this country … will this government once again be scoring an economic own goal … The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has estimated that 25,000 jobs will be lost"</p></blockquote>
because of the low spending power of people now covered by wages councils.

	<br><blockquote><p>"We have now reached the point where the awards are starting to cost jobs even in companies like mine, and to put small companies out of business altogether."</p></blockquote>
Would not it be sensible for the hon. Gentleman to listen to the universal view of employers that wages councils cost jobs? Does not he have a responsibility to listen to those with most knowledge, rather than quote from scribblers in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> and other authors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to take account of any representations about the Bill that have been made public. I am aware of those that I have received, but I should welcome it if the Minister were to publish all the representations so that we can make a fair and honest assessment of the impact of the loss of wages councils. To some extent, the Minister's response supported the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. There is a need for a strong assessment of what Forte said in the light of the comments of trade unions, organisations, local authorities, other employers and, indeed, the reported 60 per cent. of employers who responded to the consultation in 1988. If the Minister wants to concede the amendment, we shall very much welcome and strongly consider the views of Forte in any representations about how the Bill should progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a risk of jobs being lost because of wages councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman would care to visit my constituency he would discover that the biggest risk to job losses is the closure of the Point of Air colliery and of the local steelworks, and the lack of spending power in the construction industry and elsewhere. There will always be some jobs that go to the wall because of policy changes. Overall however, I believe that the spending power that wages councils create and their justice and fairness merit their retention. That is why the Opposition support a minimum wage policy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So does the hon. Gentleman accept that there is a risk of jobs being lost as a result of wages councils?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will probably always be one or two employers who will say, "Yes, we are losing a job because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0679">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
of this". I think that all my hon. Friends recognise that fact. Overall, however, the current spending power of those 2.6 million people creates more jobs than if wages were to be reduced. People should earn a just amount for the jobs that they do. A basic standard of employment practice needs to be maintained so that people have a fair deal in a fair market and so that poor and bad employers do not undercut the good employers. That is the crucial point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that there could be no element of risk when employers are so embarassed by the low wages set by wages councils that they voluntarily pay more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely right. The hon. Gentleman hits the nail on the head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the static view of the economy, held by the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald), an interesting one? If a company goes out of business, the demand is taken up by more effective and efficient companies which can afford to pay higher wages. He seems to take a static view of industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He highlights an interesting point that Conservative members of the Committee made when we were discussing the abolition of various employment sectors. I presume that, if those jobs were abolished and I were to turn up in the constituency of the hon. Member for Scarborough on Monday morning, I would find all the hotels closed. No one would be there to man them because those employment sectors would have been abolished and so the whole industry in Scarborough would have collapsed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot dismiss the arguments. A large company such as the Ladbroke Group plc, of which the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, West (Mr. Janner) is a director, wrote to the Department of Employment and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Hilton International Hotels have awaited this action"—</p></blockquote>
the abolition of wages councils—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for some considerable time and because of the delay, we have had no alternative but to introduce a recruitment freeze".</p></blockquote>
Ladbroke is a substantial company. The hon. Gentleman cannot just brush aside the concerns of such companies. This is not a matter of theory. We are talking about large employers who say that they are not recruiting but shedding people because of the wages councils that the hon. Gentleman defends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister care to remind the Committee of the salaries of the chief executives and directors of Hilton or Forte hotels? [Hon. Members: "What has that to do with it?"] Conservative Members ask what that has to do with it. There is a way to reduce costs over and above making those at the lowest end of the income bracket suffer most of the consequences. Can the Minister name one Forte hotel that has closed in the past year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. and learned Member for Leicester, West can help the hon. Gentleman, but Forte has made it clear that it is shedding labour because of wages council awards above the rate of inflation—9 per
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
cent. in one year. Such companies are having to cope with the consequences of the recession. How can they meet such pay awards and maintain differentials if not by shedding labour? Instead of asking how many hotels have been closed, why does not the hon. Gentleman accept that people have lost their jobs because of such awards and companies' inability to pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One reason why hotel chains are facing difficulties—perhaps the Minister would care to listen—is not wages council awards but the recession caused by the Government. The loss of spending power in the economy will be heightened by the abolition of wages councils. In arguing for the abolition of wages councils, is the chief executive of Trusthouse Forte, of Hilton or of any other major hotel chain proposing to take a proportionate cut in his salary? It is all very well to argue for a pay reduction of the lowest-paid members of society, but they do valuable jobs. If there were no cleaners or bar staff in those hotels, the chain would not be profitable, nor even be open.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Government would like to read the letter from Forte, which is available. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Much nonsense is talked about the absolute level of the minimum rate. What is important is that the percentage increase awarded by the Councils creates expectations amongst all our workforce which produce inflationary pressures."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman keeps failing to address that point, but it is the one that is resulting in people losing their jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have reached an honest disagreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's inquisition, perhaps he can explain why, if wages council settlements are causing job losses, there are more people in wages council industries than previously and why those people form an increasing proportion of the work force. It appears to be the people who are not covered by wages councils who are losing their jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his timely intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has produced a letter from Forte, with which he purports to entertain the Committee. I should welcome, as would my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, the publication of all the evidence supporting the abolition of wages councils so that we can make a fair assessment. Bearing in mind that Forte has produced the letter at this late stage, that would give Conservative Members the opportunity to vote for the amendment and for all members of the Committee to have the benefit of Forte's advice before the Bill proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall sum up as I have been talking for about 30 minutes, which is a reasonable time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden says that it is enough [Hon. Members: "It is never enough."] Oh, it is never enough. I shall say more later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Taking account of everything that has been said, I challenge the Minister or any member of the Committee
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0680">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
to tell me that, if the proposal is accepted, wages will not be forced down. If wages will not be forced down, what is the point of abolishing wages councils? The Minister has said and Conservative Members have shown that they want to create employment and that the only way to create employment is to force down the wages of people in employment. It is morally unjustified and morally bankrupt to force down wage levels, which are currently in the region of £100 to £110 per week. That is why we shall oppose the clause and ask hon. Members to support the amendment.

Bad employers will undercut good employers. Stand up all those hon. Members who support bad employment practice and who support the examples that I gave of constituents who are forced to work overtime, at no premium rate, at one hour's notice or who are told, if they object, that they can leave, because there are plenty of other people to do their job. Will the hon. Members for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Oliver), for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), for Scarborough, for Elmet (Mr. Batiste) or for anywhere else stand up now and tell me that they support the bad practices of employers in the community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sykes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the people who run guest houses and hotels in my constituency, who are offering jobs at the rates that they are offering, are bad employers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Delyn resumes, may I tell him that he must address the Chair, not hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Knox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To reply to the hon. Gentleman's question, many employers in the tourist trade are notoriously bad payers. The Opposition believe that we should set a minimum rate, which is accepted as reasonable. The profits and services provided by those industries are not provided solely by the people who own them but by the people who work in them. Conservative Members must recognise,—this applies especially in my constituency, which has a heavy tourist base—the need to set a basic minimum wage, because workers in the tourist industry deserve a basic level of pay, below which they should not fall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of inspection, whatever the rights and wrongs of minimum levels of pay and good and bad practice, the Government inspection service can at present inspect and consider terms and conditions of service and wages to ascertain whether they are fair. The clause will wipe out any form of independent check on any employer. That will result in the continuation of bad practice in terms and conditions of employment. At present, I can ask a wages inspector to visit a factory in my constituency. If the clause is agreed to and our amendments are not accepted, that inspection service will be abolished and those jobs will go. More importantly, however, the bad practice, which is currently above ground and can be inspected, will go below ground and people will have no legal redress against any form of bad practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
If the Minister and Conservative Members reject the amendments and vote for the clause, they will, I repeat, be condoning bad practice. Next time evidence comes to light of bad practice in any industry, in the tourist trade or anywhere else, I presume that Conservative Members will tell the House that they condone it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is agreed to, the United Kingdom will be one of the few European Community countries in which no minimum wage is set. As my hon. Friends have mentioned, equality between the sexes will be diminished. No good will come of the Bill. I shall be proud to support the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. I shall be even prouder to vote for the maintenance of a minumum wage until a Labour Government introduce a proper statutory minimum wage to defend the rights of ordinary working people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our consideration of wages councils, we are not talking just about wages. A letter sent to me by the Nuneaton citizens advice bureau, which is against the abolition of the wages councils, refers to one of its clients
	<br><blockquote><p>"who is working as a fully trained hairdresser receiving a nominal amount of £1.30 per hour, with no commission. Without the intervention of the appropriate wages council, this hourly rate would not have been challenged and our client would not have received an increase in wages."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members were not talking about that type of person when they mentioned people on low pay with low skills. This is a fully trained worker, with many skills at her disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is even worse that these people are being exploited. I hope that Conservative Members do not agree that workers should be exploited, wherever that might happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in jobs that are not protected by wages councils are in more danger of being exploited than any other group of workers. The letter from Nuneaton citizens advice bureau went on to say.
	<br><blockquote><p>"This situation is not unique, without the wages councils, clients would unlikely press for higher wages independently for fear of losing their jobs."</p></blockquote>
I do not think that workers' protection and the statutory rights of workers should be taken away. They need reasonable recompense for their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this era of Government charters, I regard this proposal, in the so-called Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Bill, as a bad gaffers charter. Those people who are determined to exploit workers will do so at the expense of good employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman help the Committee by explaining how wages councils protect workers? He said that without the protection of the wages councils, someone who complained about their rate of pay could be dismissed. How would a wages council which sets a rate of pay be able to protect those people? If they had less than two years service, their vulnerability to dismissal would not be affected by the existence of a wages council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the Minister has been a Member of the House for too long and is divorced from the situation outside. In a time when 3 million people are officially recognised as being unemployed—the figure is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0681">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
probably nearer 4 million or 5 million—people on low incomes are extremely vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case that I mentioned, if that person has said to her employer, "Look, you're only paying me £1.30 an hour. That is not the going rate for the job, according to the wages council, so I want what I'm entitled to", she would not have been dismissed. The wages councils and the wages inspectors give those people extra protection in an anonymous way. They can raise matters so that an employer is put right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An employer may be ignorant of the proper rate of pay and might take advantage of the wages councils putting him right. Evidence shows that some employers in small and medium-sized firms welcome the retention of wages councils. Throughout industry—whether in Nuneaton, Scarborough or Whitby—a standard wage would enable employers to know where they stood and to plan their annual employment costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still not clear how the hon. Gentleman can believe that wages councils protect people from being dismissed. If a wages council sets a rate of pay that an employer cannot afford, an employee may lose his job. Is the hon. Gentleman arguing that people enjoy protection because the wages council makes an order? That does not apply unless a person has two years' service. A part-time worker has to have five years' service. Someone who works fewer than eight hours a week has no protection. Is not the hon. Gentleman muddling two separate and distinct issues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am trying to explain the reality of the position. In a time of great recession, people need every safeguard they can get to protect not only their jobs, but the rate at which they are paid. Conservative Members would not be in their jobs if they did not consider that they were remunerated fairly. Many people are being exploited, and if wages councils were wiped away, more people could be exploited by bad employers. Surely, in 1993, workers should not be pushed in that direction.

When reference was made to Spain and Greece—[Hon. Members; "France."] My comment about the employment of young people caused some mirth among Conservative Members. I have always been tremendously proud of this country because of its industrial development. However, for many years we have been slipping down the league in terms of employment prospects for young people, which causes me some pain. The countries that were mentioned had mainly rural economies for many years and are now increasing their industrial base. It is a tragic comedy of errors that, as they are doing that, the Government seem hellbent on our going in the opposite direction. I feel angry that good, trained young people—the future lifeblood of this country—are denied worthwhile employment as a result of Conservative policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With other members of the Anglo Japanese all party group, I visited Nomura Bank International yesterday to listen to, among others, representatives from Nissan who said that the company's greatest wealth was its work force. They were not paying lip service; they believed it. By abolishing the wages councils, the Government will be doing a disservice to many good employers who value their work force. They will be undercut by ruthless employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
Evidence suggests that such a move will cost the Exchequer money in rate rebates, rent rebates, family credits and council tax rebates—the safety nets that protect and help the worst-off in society. Many Opposition Members believe that those levels of help and assistance are not pitched right. However, if the wages councils are abolished, even more people will be driven into that trap. Abolition will also have a downward influence on wages in other occupations not covered by wages councils. That should be readily understood by the public, with the possible exception of those who receive relatively high, protected salaries in the City. Without a level, set from both sides of industry, ordinary working people will suffer in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall vote for the amendment. I hope that Conservative Members will search their consciences, that they will read the overwhelming evidence placed before them on the dangers to society that would be created, and that, like me they will not vote to exploit workers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. Clause 28 represents yet another ratcheting down of the protections afforded—and they are minimal—to working people. Many of the protections have disappeared during the past 14 years. Wages councils cover many of what I can only describe as the working poor. What has happened in the economy during the past 14 years will have affected the labour market and the pay of the working poor, which will be further worsened by the abolition of the wages councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members spoke of society having changed. I agree that it has changed a great deal since 1908 when Winston Churchill first made a case for trade boards. Certain themes have run through the creation of our economic system and our society in the 20th century. It is a bit rich for the Government to talk about things being old-fashioned in 1908 when, for the past 14 years, they have been motivated by a much older philosophy—that of 19th century liberalism, with a hefty mixture of Benthamite utilitarianism. Mr. Bentham himself created the workhouses and the Poor Law. If the wages councils are abolished, I expect a new clause to be added to the Bill introducing a new system of workhouses to ensure that those whose already meagre earnings will be ratcheted down further by the Bill will be prevented from starving on the streets. That is the logic of the Government's argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard much about the coverage of wages councils. Of the 2.5 million people in the work force who are afforded the protection of wages councils, about 80 per cent. are women. The basic minimum hourly rates for the main industries covered by wages councils are hardly generous. The most generous are those for food shops—£3.08 an hour; or £120 a week before tax—for a normal 39-hour week. I wonder how many of us could exist for even one week on that—let alone contemplate condemning 2.5 million people to have their already low wages lowered even further. At the bottom of the wages council rates are rates for hairdressers, who earn a mere £2.78 an hour. Let us be under no illusion about the inadequacy of the protection already offered. The Opposition want more thorough protection of the most vulnerable in society—the working poor—than the wages councils currently give.

I shall quote Lord Gilmour again. He is an interesting chap and, even if Conservative members of the Committee do not necessarily agree with him, he represents a traditional and relevant strand of Conservative party thinking over the years, although that has been marginalised by the dash to 19th century Benthamite liberalism in which the party has indulged since 1979 or, more accurately, since 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Gilmour writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Furthermore, in a gesture unique in the developed world, the government deregulated pay and (most of the) conditions of work for people under the age of twenty-one"—</p></blockquote>
that deregulation is now to be extended to workers over 21 through the abolition of wages councils—
	<br><blockquote><p>"so that employers may now lawfully employ juveniles at any rate of pay whatever."</p></blockquote>
Under clause 28 they could lawfully employ anyone at any rate of pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Gilmour continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Cobden, Bright and other Liberal ideologues who opposed the passing of the nineteenth-century Factory Acts would have heartily approved. On the other hand that exemplary Tory wet, the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury, would have been dismayed by the Thatcherite dismantling of a significant part of the social legislation which had succeeded in protecting young people from the more disagreeable manifestations of nineteenth-century capitalism."</p></blockquote>
Many millions of people in Britain need protection from
	<br><blockquote><p>"the more disagreeable manifestations of nineteenth-century capitalism"</p></blockquote>
which have made such an appalling come-back in the late 20th century. Lord Gilmour adds:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Thatcherite excuse for this legislative help to the strong and damage to the weak is that the free market works for the good of all, even though in such circumstances a free market does not exist, being merely a euphemism for exploitation."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But all that turned out to be wrong, did it not? The wages of people under 21 admittedly did not go up as quickly as those of adults; nevertheless, they went up significantly and the market provided for them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already discussed that. There is disagreement about the validity of the data, which was dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. The Minister has made the case for a more thorough examination of the evidence before the wages councils are abolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the hon. Lady relies on what the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said. The survey to which I referred was based on a sample of 1,000. The hon. Gentleman would not tell the Committee the size of the sample used by the Greater Manchester low pay unit, on which he relied. He said that it was a large sample. In fact, the 1989 paper produced by the unit was based on 13 vacancies in jobcentres which it had surveyed, and the 1992 figures were based on 30 vacancies in jobcentres. I am surprised that the hon. Lady relies on that information. She seems to be capable of conducting proper research, instead of depending on the words of her hon. Friend, which were clearly a less than reliable platform on which to base her argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is implying that I am intelligent, I am happy to accept the compliment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may be interested to know that the 1992 survey was based on 66 jobs available—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sixty-six!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Wait a minute—66 jobs are available at jobcentres in Greater Manchester. The survey to which the hon. Gentleman refers was based on 922 jobs, not 1,000, in Britain as a whole. It was not a sample of jobs in Greater Manchester, they were the only 66 jobs available for people of that age in Greater Manchester when the survey was carried out. It was 100 per cent. of the jobs, not 922 out of the whole of Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will let us know if he has an answer to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to enlighten the hon. Lady. I wrote to the Greater Manchester low pay unit and it has not—so far as I know—contradicted what I wrote. Its 1992 figures were based on about 30 vacancies. My letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is an unsatisfactory basis on which to draw conclusions about the general level of young people's pay … First, the number of cases is too small … Second, initial wages offered by employers to new staff cannot be assumed to be a good reflection of the actual pay of young workers in employment. Third, the rates offered for vacancies outstanding at any particular point in time can be expected to be a poor indication of the general level of starting pay offered by employers."</p></blockquote>
Any reasonable person would accept those as sensible points to make. The hon. Lady said that young people's pay had been depressed, but the sample taken of the labour force showed that it had increased. Her argument was disappointing, given that the biased survey was carried out by people who are behaving like a wholly owned subsidiary of the Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments are typical of him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a back-handed compliment. Given that one of the Government's most creative achievements in the past 14 years has been to change, swap, fiddle, disrupt and generally mess around with any figures provided by the central statistical office, I find it hard to accept official statistics. I am more willing to accept the views of my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras than I am any so-called official statistics, degraded as they have been by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that any talk of statistics and accuracy from a Government who have managed to get the census wrong beggars belief?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has reinforced my point. Clause 28 will cause damage. Over the past 14 years, we have experienced 19th century, neo-classical, liberal obsessions while the Government were under thrall to Lady Thatcher. They are now, unfortunately, continuing with the same unthinking zeal under the current Prime Minister. As a direct result, a one third-two thirds society has emerged. Two thirds of people have managed to become part of the higher echelons of what is becoming an increasingly segregated labour market, while almost a

	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
third of the population is stuck in the more casual sectors of the labour market. The only protection that those people have left is wages councils, if they are lucky enough to be employed in sectors that are covered by the councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the persistent and high levels of mass unemployment that have been the direct result of the Government's economic incompetence, increasing numbers of people in the lower segment of the labour market are not covered by wages councils. By abolishing the wages councils, the Government will remove even those limited protections. The effect is to throw to the wolves of exploitative employers the rest of that one third of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen increases in inequality of income—during the past 14 years of the gradual trend towards the reduction of inequalities of income and wealth that had hitherto characterised the 20th century. We have also seen a massive growth in poverty. Even on the Government's fiddled figures, 12 per cent. of the population were living on or below the poverty line in 1979. That is now 19 per cent.—an increase from 9 million to 19 million, or one in five of the work force. That is not a marginal problem at the lower end of the labour market; it is now a way of life for millions of people.

The Government argue that people should work for a security firm for £1.30 an hour for an 18-hour, seven-day week so that they can rise to other jobs. When will such people have time to plan career moves? They do not even know how they will pay for their next meal. It is so much balderdash. It is offensive to the many people who struggle on hour upon hour, week after week, with disgracefully low pay to be told to put up with it because they may get on and become the chief executive of MacDonald's. Even if that were the Government's strategy for getting people off the lower end of the labour market, surely only one chief executive would be needed. My life would not be worth living if there were even more burger bars. That is not an acceptable way to deal with the social condition of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past 14 years, we have seen a progressive degeneration. We have returned to the standards of living and the narrowed life opportunities of the 1930s and of the sort that existed in the 19th century. I believed that a rich, western country would not have to put up with those again, yet we are back there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the Government's motives for abolition? They say that the economy has changed and that conditions in the labour market have moved on from the turn of the century. However, little has changed. There is more of a benefit net now, but if particular individuals qualify for benefit, more exploitative employers will be subsidised by the taxpayer than at the turn of the century. Some people slip through the benefit net—for example, 16 and 17-year-olds have been removed altogether. That is why we see people of that age sleeping on the streets of our capital and of other cities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady agree that because the Government's case for getting rid of wages councils was poor, and was certainly not a vote-catcher, it was not included in the Conservative manifesto?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that it was an interesting omission. The Government have been unusually coy. They do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
want to debate the issues, but simply to indulge in scare tactics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating levels of pay that are so low that they are almost not worth working for. A survey of jobs currently advertised in jobcentres in the north-west shows that they are all below the lowest wages council rates. The survey includes interesting examples of the security industry, of which the Minister seemed to be in awe. I am lost for words to think that the Minister believes that we should be proud of the security industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bolton jobcentre advertises for a security guard to work 65 hours a week at £2.25 an hour. Those long hours will provide gross take-home pay of £146.25 a week. Another job that the same jobcentre is advertising is for a security guard to patrol a building site seven nights a week—he will be outside and probably in dangerous conditions—for £2.10 an hour. Job after job is advertised paying £2.25 or £2.12 an hour. Some jobs for 16 to 17-year-olds, who are a vulnerable group of workers because the safety net of a right to benefit has been withdrawn from them, pay even less. One job that is advertised is for a full-time junior trainee hairdresser at £35 a week which is under £1 an hour. In the second year she—it will probably be a she—can aspire to £40 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell me how low he is prepared to see wages fall? The economic reasoning behind the Government's proposal to abolish wages councils is to cut wages even further. How much lower can wages go? According to neo-classical economics and the equilibrium of pay and jobs, there is nothing to stop wage rates falling to zero, depending on where the demand and supply curves are drawn. The clear nonsense of that is obvious to anyone who talks to people who are affected by those rates of pay, but the theory does not exclude such an outcome. Where is the floor for wages? Does any Conservative Member know where he wants that floor to be set? The logic of the neo-classical economic model of the labour market is that wages can fall to zero. It is possible that people would pay employers to allow them to work, so wages could even go below zero. How low should wages be allowed to fall?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Lady. She referred to youngsters being taken on as trainees and to wage levels. One thing that has gone wrong in this country is that very high wage levels have been paid to youngsters. Instead of spending money on pay, employers should spend it on training to improve the quality of their work force. It used to be common ground between the parties that the apprenticeship system was a good system. It involved low rates of pay, but employers put more money into training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Lady had her way, enlightened employers who provide training, perhaps with a lower rate of pay, would be unable to do so because they would be compelled by Parliament to pay more than they could afford.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely amazed that the Minister believes that £35 a week is too high a level for a trainee hairdresser. If the Minister did not have an official car to take him from one place to another, he would probably spend more than that on taxis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spellar</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is now no mystery why the country's training system is in such a mess. The Minister is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0684">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
obviously not aware that as the pay for apprentices and the ratio of apprentice pay to the school rate have deteriorated, so the number of apprenticeships has fallen. That reflects two factors: the undermining of training schemes across the country and the recession. To survive, companies have foolishly cut the number of apprenticeships, especially in the construction industry where the numbers are crashing through the floor due to the slump. The Minister should be concerned about that, but he is obviously not even aware of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey asked what the Government perceive as an acceptable level. Several times on the Floor of the House I have raised questions about a security guard in my constituency who is paid £1.85 an hour, out of which he has to support himself and his family, pay his rent and everything else. I have yet to receive a response, so it would appear that the Government deem £1.85 an hour to be an acceptable wage for an employee of a security company, who works at a Government establishment defending this country's defence industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still await an answer to my question about how low the Convervative party thinks it is reasonable for wages to fall. The Conservatives' economic activity, and their activities in the labour market since their election to office in 1979, have been based on 19th century, neo-classical economic theory. I see that no Conservative member of the Committee is prepared to stand up and say how low it is appropriate for wages to fall. We must assume, therefore, that Conservative Members have no view on that matter and that, as far as they are concerned, wages can fall to zero. If they can find someone prepared to work for that rate, that rate can be paid. The logical extension of the neo-classic theory, which seems to be their motivation, would be slavery. Perhaps they intend to reinstate slavery but in a more honest form than that attempted in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there is a case against the abolition of wages councils but unfortunately we have not heard it this morning. If such a case exists, the hon. Lady has ruined it by becoming rather absurd. The idea that, because we believe that wage levels and terms and conditions are best agreed between employers and employees as free agents, we are in favour of slavery, is absurd. The hon. Lady appears puzzled by the notion that there might be jobs that people are prepared to carry out for no wage. She has only to look at the many volunteers, without whom our caring services would be lost. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
hon. Lady cannot stand the idea that people should be free to choose for themselves their terms and conditions [	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that that was an incredible response from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The ghost of Adam Smith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—although Adam Smith was around a long time before 1908 and he has been much misinterpreted by Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister talks about choice, he should put himself in the position of someone who wonders where his next meal is coming from and who is offered poverty wages. Opposition Members do not regard that as a proper choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has also failed to take into account—if we go back to neo-classical theory—some of the failures of the market system that can be found when we examine a deregulated labour market at work. In recalling the now oft-quoted comments made by Winston Churchill when he set up trade boards, we should also recall that he identified a failure of the market when he observed that, if a labour market is totally deregulated, bad and exploitative employers and the Gradgrinds of the world, who the Conservatives seem to have adopted as their official mascot, are given incentives to undercut, undermine and generally ruin the economic prospects of more enlightened employers. That would constitute a failure of the market. The Minister seems to have no analysis whatever of market failures and the poverty, deprivation and decline in quality of work to which such a failure in the labour market leads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would like to continue but the clock seems to be approaching 1 pm. I feel as though I am at the Oval with one ball to go before lunch. I wanted to examine the likely effects on the economy of the abolition of wages councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is my contention that the only possible reason why the Government should contemplate abolition is so that already grossly low wages can be lowered further. What kind of effect will that have in my constituency in the north-west? Some research has been carried out to try to discover that effect. It has been estimated—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
