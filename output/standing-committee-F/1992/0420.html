	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [15 April]:</i> No. 33, in page 2, line 15, after 'board', insert 'or any person'.—[	<i>Mr. Campbell-Savours</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dealing with amendment No. 33 at the end of our previous sitting. I want not to drag out the amendment but to draw attention to the milk marketing board's original reaction to the proposal of the Department of Trade and Industry. It said that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Bill is based on the premise that it is for the boards to propose how their assets should be dealt with under a reorganisation scheme. A scheme of reorganisation can only be approved if it meets stringent requirements laid down in the Bill and if it in other respects also has the Minister's approval, as stated in the Bill. Multiple inconsistent proposals would create chaos and would put producers' assets into weak co-operatives easily dominated by powerful buyers. No legislation or Government could possibly entertain proposals for the reorganisation of the Milk Marketing Board other than from the Milk Marketing Board itself, which has legal responsibility for the custody and prudent management of its assets."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that it is unreasonable to adopt the Dairy Trade Federation approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such is the view of the milk marketing board but not necessarily of many of the producers who comprise the board's membership. The reality is that a number of organisations and individuals have suggested in the farming press that Ministers should at least be required to consider alternative schemes for reorganisation. The amendment would provide the opportunity for persons and organisations other than the milk marketing board to propose a subsequent or successor organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also turn the Committee's attention to the views that have been expressed to me directly by the DTF as they are very important. Organisations that are represented through the DTF buy, in effect, £2.5 billion of products for processing every year. It is very big business indeed. One would have thought that an organisation of that scale and with that sort of market in one product only—a market that is larger than the economy of many advanced countries—at least would have had the opportunity to propose schemes itself or certainly to feel assured that those who might not agree with the milk marketing boards should have the right to propose schemes for consideration by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
I understand that when these matters were discussed in the other place, the noble Lord Mottistone, attempted to amend the Bill in the fashion that I am suggesting. I shall be specific and say that his comments are noted in columns 102–109 of 	<i>Hansard</i> of 8 December 1992 because I understand that last week some difficulties arose after I quoted from 	<i>Hansard.</i> However, the noble Lord Mottistone was unsuccessful in his attempt. The noble Lord Howe believed that producer interests were already served by clause 3(4)(b), which required
	<br><blockquote><p>"reasonable provision for the distribution of assets to registered producers"—[	<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 8 December 1992, vol. 541, c. 108.]</p></blockquote>
There was also the possibility of availability of marketing grants under Part III of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DTF said that in a move towards a freer market it is essential that producers be permitted full participation in determining their future. If producer groups are not given the right by statute to propose the successor bodies to which a share of the board's wealth can be transferred, there can be no guarantee that their interests will be adequately represented by the milk marketing boards in accepting a scheme of reorganisation or by the Minister when he considers the milk marketing board's proposals under clause 3(4)(b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, if it had been possible to submit a different structure to the Minister for consideration, the views taken on the distribution of assets might have been different from those being expressed by the milk marketing boards. As I said the other day, and I repeat only for emphasis, Ministers are having to consider individual co-operatives as an alternative to Milk Marque, so it may not have been necessary for Dairy Crest's assets to have been withdrawn from the milk marketing board and floated under a separate arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In France and, indeed, in other countries in the European Community, there is a tradition of smaller co-operatives being vertically integrated while retaining their assets. They can supply the market and maintain dairies and processing plants. In this country, we have lost that opportunity because of Ministers' insistence on accepting schemes only from milk marketing boards, which want only to protect their assets when the successor authorities that they propose are set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a serious one. I do not know whether it meets what is legally required by lawyers. However, Ministers reacted rapidly to a proposal that we made previously on timing and I understand that they tabled amendments to deal with another issue that we raised. Therefore, I am sure that, were the amendment to secure or gain favour, if it were incorrectly drafted, Ministers would be prepared to propose an amendment that meets the objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
recommend that the Committee rejects the amendment. The reason for that is simple. The milk marketing board's assets belong to the producers, and the milk marketing board should have the right to propose a scheme for the successor body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the assets of the milk marketing board belonged to the producers. Does he agree that, as part of any scheme of reorganisation, there should be no artificial discrimination between those producers who want to trade with Milk Marque and those who want to trade with the Northern Milk Partnership? To the extent that assets belong to all producers, the proceeds of those assets should be distributed to all producers, not given to some rather than to all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that it would be unwise for the board to propose a scheme that appears to include an artificial incentive—or, for that matter, an artificial disincentive—which would affect the way in which producers behave and the choices that they make. When we debate the assets in detail, as, inevitably, we shall, members of the Committee will express their views on that. But it may help the Committee if I outline the steps that must be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) was right to say that, if the board were to propose a series of regional co-operatives, their vertical integration would not meet the same objection as would the vertical integration of a single co-operative. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, Scottish Office would say that the objections to vertical integration in the Scottish boards, where there is less market control, are not the same as the objections to vertical integration in the gigantic English and Welsh boards. We must consider the different circumstances of the different boards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present arrangement, the milk marketing board will propose a scheme, which must be accompanied by four arguments, the first of which concerns the reorganisation scheme. Secondly, we must hear why we should approve the scheme. Thirdly, we must have a statement of the trading practices of each successor body and, finally, a statement of why those trading practices meet the needs of purchasers. In other words, the board is required to give an exposition of the schemes that it proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry and the Scottish Office must be satisfied on three counts: first, that the board has consulted producers; secondly, that the scheme does what is specified in the schedule—in other words, that it conforms with the requirements of the legislation—and, finally, that the statement of trading practices takes account of the interests of the purchasers of milk. Before we give approval, the Ministry must determine that effective consultation takes place between it and the Scottish Office and producers, purchasers, retailers and consumers. Only
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
then will we decide whether it is right to approve the scheme. It is for the board to make the bid, as it were, and for the Ministry to satisfy itself that the bid is well-founded and reasonable. In the light of that, I do not think that it is right to say that anybody can propose a scheme—that would delay matters, and would mean that the Ministry would have to pick and choose between schemes. There might be two or three perfectly reasonable schemes, but it is not for Ministers to pick and choose between them. It is reasonable that, in the disposal of assets of the board and of the successor body, the effective bid should come from the people who represent the producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks about picking between schemes. Some of us who believe in strong government wonder why the Minister is not making his own proposals. Why is he dependent on schemes being proposed by the milk marketing boards? The Minister and the Government have a view on the way forward. Why does not the Minister take responsibility for that view and drive it forward?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because I do not think that I should have the responsibility of deciding what to do with somebody else's assets. I do not think that that is right, nor that it is the job of Government. We determine, with the board, that there is a certain, desirable course of action. The board has proposed schemes for change from the start. Therefore, we have a responsibility to ensure that what is proposed meets certain criteria, notably those for giving a fair deal to producers, whichever option is chosen, and that it satisfies those with major concerns about the sector. I do not think that we should have a deterministic view of what is right and what is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he should not necessarily have a view about the distribution of someone else's assets. The debate is not just about assets, but about the whole profile of an industry, arising out of providing Ministers with enabling legislation, which they can use as a tool to create a new structure. We are giving immeasurable powers to Ministers. Surely they must have a view of what the macro-shape of the market will be—surely they must have some vision. Surely they cannot just leave it, abdicate responsibility and give it to an outside organisation and say, "You, the milk marketing board, decide what will happen in the future." Ministers must have a view. All that we are asking is that several different views be considered by Ministers prior to any decisions, as against those of the milk marketing boards alone, which have a particular axe to grind—to secure their survival in one form or another, to put it bluntly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that most of us are anxious to secure our survival in one form or another. That is not an attribute which is unique to the milk marketing board, I suspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington said that we should have a view of the macro-shape of the market.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
Why is it the Government's job to have a view of the macro-shape of the market? We are putting the organisation into the market. We cannot put it into the market and then have a deterministic view of how the market should behave. That is not consistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Marland 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gloucestershire, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government having views on how the market should take shape is one reason why, in the past, the economy of this country has got into terrible difficulty? The Government tried to have too much of a fixed view on how markets should be formed and created?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. I am a modest sort of bloke and sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear. The Government are not going to wait for the milk marketing board to propose a scheme and then approve it. It is not the purpose of the Bill to give the milk marketing board carte blanche for whatever it thinks might be convenient. The Bill lays down criteria against which we have to judge the scheme. There will be an option at that time for Ministers to decide whether the scheme will deliver what we believe has to be delivered. It is our job to base our decision on what the boards put forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would allow anyone to put forward an alternative scheme. We would have to sit down and adjudicate as between those schemes. It is sensible that the board should have the right to make that bid because the scheme will deal primarily with its assets. The way in which it deals with those assets will be an essential part of the judgment that we make. The board, if it has any sense, will listen to the debate in Committee, as it will have done to the debate on the Floor of the House, to hear people's views about those assets. We shall then make our judgment. I recommend that we do not accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say to the Minister that I am not altogether convinced by his case and I hope that that view is shared not only by my hon. Friends but across the Committee. This is enabling legislation. We, as I said, are giving Ministers a considerable power. They will be making decisions on our behalf. We want consultation with and input by the producers, processors and everyone interested in this market to be as wide as possible before decisions are made. At the moment, only the milk marketing boards are able to submit schemes which is resulting in the consideration of narrow arrangements rather than the consideration of much wider arrangements that many in the market are saying should be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Ministers are going to stick their heels in and remain rigid on this issue, may I assume that, by recognising that there is some concern about the narrow nature of input for the proposals, the Minister intends to widen that input when we reach the issue of
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
consultation and our amendments which deal with that? At some stage, something has to give. We cannot sit rigidly in the Committee with little consultation on the amendments and no alternative schemes being advanced so that the matter is kept tight, and let Milk Marque, which wants 80 per cent. of the market and which for all I know, might be on target to get more, determine what will happen in the market. It is a huge market.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider amendment No. 80, in page 2, line 25, after 'trading', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'including the arrangements for pricing, continuity, delivery and means of settling disputes.'</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading, I said that if the Bill received a Second Reading the Opposition would adopt a constructive approach in Committee to the new arrangements to replace the milk marketing boards. My hon. Friend the Member for Workington reiterated that last week. That is the spirit in which I moved the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill states clearly what is being abolished. The statutory scheme is being terminated and there will no longer be milk marketing boards with monopoly power to buy all the milk that comes on to the market from dairy farms other than from those farmers who have an exemption and pay the levy. At present the boards are obliged to buy all the milk that is produced on our farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear what is being abolished—a well organised and regulated set of arrangements. But it is not clear what will replace those arrangements. There is nothing in the Bill on that, but it gives Ministers tremendous scope on what will follow the milk marketing boards. We have made it clear that it was a mistake simply to require the boards to put forward reorganisation schemes. The Government should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0030">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
have invited all interested parties—the boards which are the central players in the market, the companies, the Dairy Trade Federation, the producers and the consumer organisations—to give their views on a range of schemes followed by genuine and open consultation on the arrangements to follow abolition of the boards. The Government, not the boards, should have introduced a scheme based on the widest consultation and, because of the enormous importance of the milk industry to consumers and the economy, that scheme should have been subject to parliamentary approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must use the Committee to try to tease out from the Government the criteria that will apply to the reorganisation. Clearly there has been dialogue, which will continue, on the precise content of the reorganisation schemes that the boards will submit. Clause 2(2) is inadequate. It is not sufficiently explicit on the criteria to be met and we want the Minister to tell us what he is looking for in the future arrangements for the purchase and sale of milk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An immediate problem, to which I referred on Second Reading, is the sheer instability that the legislation will create. From day one of the introduction of the new scheme the Office of Fair Trading will be able to challenge the new arrangements. Within two years, which is not a long time in terms of significant investment in the dairy industry, the European Commission will be free to challenge any of the schemes that will be operating in this country. What consultation will take place with those two bodies in the run-up to the Government's decision on the reorganisation scheme? Will the Office of Fair Trading discuss the boards' proposals with civil servants at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and will a secret deal be reached so that the OFT does not mount a challenge on the grounds that there is not adequate flexibility in the market and adequate free and unfettered competition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the European Commission? Will it really go no further than the two-year undertaking? I am sure that the answer is no. I should be grateful for any qualification from the Minister, but whatever deal or understanding is reached with the Office of Fair Trading—I do not mean that in a pejorative sense—will not be acceptable to the European Commission in Brussels. Whatever follows the present statutory scheme will definitely be open to challenge by the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who has followed these matters over the years knows that the Commission comes under pressure from other countries that want a share of the British market. It was not easy for the Labour Government of 1970 to secure the regulations which provided for continuation of the boards—the regulations that provide the basis of the boards' operations under Community law—and I remember the opposition in the Council from France and Ireland who were motivated to some extent by the
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
interests of their industries. They wanted to make the arrangements in Britain freer so that those countries would have greater opportunities in the longer term to replace British production in the British market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should be under no illusion about the importance of decisions taken by the European Commission, and we must recognise that we are moving into uncharted waters. It is important to be absolutely clear on what the new arrangements will mean in practice for the operation of the milk market in this country. It is useless stumbling into a new scene with half-baked arrangements comparable to those in the energy market. We have seen the fiasco of the president of the Board of Trade being totally humiliated in Parliament and having to cobble together a scheme which many of us believe is totally inadequate for the future of the coal industry. I hope that we shall not find that within two years of the Bill's enactment the Government's dogmatic approach has wrecked the same havoc on the milk industry as it has on the British deep-mined coal industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our discussions are crucial to the future arrangements for the sale and supply of milk in this country. Clause 2(2)(c) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in relation to each successor body proposed to be engaged in milk trading, of the practices proposed to be adopted by it with respect to such trading."</p></blockquote>
We want to extend that provision to include a specific reference to arrangements for the pricing and allocation of milk. Today I received the milk marketing board's comments on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It maintains that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 2(2)(d) requires the applicant to state the reasons for believing that those practices take account of the interests of the purchasers of milk. This wording is taken to mean that the arrangements covering the pricing and delivery of milk is very broad and does not require amplification in the context of the free market in milk that the MMB has proposed."</p></blockquote>

We beg to differ with that opinion. Given the extent to which we are moving into entirely uncharted waters, we are surely entitled to receive a Government assurance that all these crucial aspects will be adequately covered in the submission that is received from the board, and in the reorganisation scheme that will eventually have to be approved by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are most concerned about the implications of the changes for the price of milk, and with good reason. It is fair to say that the milk marketing board has made no secret that the price will increase by about 20 per cent. That is just for starters. We are discussing not only the sharp increase that we are about to see in the price of milk, but, more importantly, the creation of a situation where there could be a continued exploitation of the marketplace by Milk Marque, the successor body to the MMB, to the disadvantage of consumers and the country as a whole.

When the president of the Dairy Trade Federation addressed a federation lunch towards the end of last year, he expressed his fears of a "price explosion". As my hon. Friend the Member for Workington has said, we must take the views of the DTF—as well as the MMBs and the National Farmers Union—extremely seriously. It is not Opposition Members who are conjuring up fears of a price explosion. The MMB has put it on record that the price of milk will sharply increase, and the DTF has spoken of a "price explosion".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to the MMB especially because it is huge and dominant, but what I say obviously applies to the reorganisation schemes that are to be submitted for Scotland and Northern Ireland. It is crucial that the reorganisation scheme that is proposed by the MMB is able to reassure us that the marketplace will not be exploited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be difficult for the board to reassure us because of the role that it is bound to want to play. We do not know how many producers will sign up with Milk Marque, the new producer incorporative. It has been suggested that 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. might join. As the MMB is already in place, and becaue the farmers' belief is that the best way to defend their interests in the long run is to be part of the single cooperative—unity is strength in the marketplace—it is not unreasonable to conclude that more than 80 per cent. of producers—perhaps more than 90 per cent.—will subscribe to Milk Marque. That proportion may change. That would mean that there would be a large, dominant selling organisation in the marketplace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Devizes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's remarks. He referred earlier, to the milk marketing board's brief, which we all received this morning. If he examines the last paragraph of notes on this matter, he will find that it answers his points. It states that even if three quarters of the farmers become members of Milk Marque, that would represent only 8 per cent. of the total EC milk production, which is less than the EC overall surplus. At that level of membership, it is estimated that Milk Marque would have have sufficient milk to supply only 40 per cent. of dairy products purchased in the high street. That does not demonstrate the dominance of market which was suggested by the hon. Gentleman. I should be interested to hear his response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because I wanted to come on to that matter. The crucial point is that there is concern about the liquid milk market, particularly liquid milk which is sold through doorstep delivery services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very costly to move liquid milk, and it is not the case that the threat of supplies from France or Ireland will act as anything like the brake on the market price that the MMB's brief suggests. When it comes to the manufacture of products such as milk, yoghurt and cheese, I accept that there is a European market offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
The answer to the point made by the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) and to the board's submission can be seen in the Government's stance in Scotland. The Government have accepted the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report. All that a tanker has to do is cross the border—it does not have to cross the channel. However, MMC concluded and the Government concurred, that there was not an adequate movement of milk across the border to allow the Scottish MMB to have the integrated co-operative which I should have liked to see. There is no constraint of movement across the England-Scotland border. The real issue of liquid milk is the cost of moving it on a daily or less frequent basis from France or Ireland to the doorstep. I am not reassured that the existence of supplies in other countries will put a brake on the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental issue in the milk market is not the boards, although it used to be when they were established in the 1930s and as they operated in the 1950s because they provided support for the producers. Milk quotas are now the fundamental issue. They are much more important to the future of milk supply and prices. The supply cannot be increased. I hope that we in this country are agreed that quotas are not in the interests of the farming industry that we want to develop. At the moment, the market cannot operate. Under the old system, if prices were jacked up, the result was highly profitable; the producers would get more money, they would increase production and more people would move into milk production. That is the way in which a free market operates. There is no such market in milk however, because of quotas. The arrangements that enforce the quotas are penal. That is the fundamental factor that underlies our discussion and it is why there is concern throughout the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that many producers are uneasy about the territory into which they are moving because they know in their heart of hearts that there is instability. It is one thing to have a statutory scheme in which the price is fixed on the basis of an agreement in the joint committee between the DTF and the milk boards—the producers and the dairy companies. It is another to have a sitaution where there is no constraint on the price and where the co-operative, albeit voluntary, and any farmer in the country will be able to sell to the Northern Milk Partnership, Nestle or Unigate. When the proposed legislation comes into force, Milk Marque may well operate with well over 80 per cent. of the liquid milk coming from our farms every day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are creating a remarkable state of affairs, which is why the DTF has expressed to hon. Members some of the views which I have reiterated in Committee. We are not satisfied that the Bill adequately lays down the criteria which the Minister should take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are implications for the doorstep delivery service, which I believe remains an important asset. It provides many jobs and it is beneficial to those who are ill and to the elderly. It is an excellent system, of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0032">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
which there is a great tradition in this country. It is true that the proportion of liquid milk being sold through the doorstep delivery system has been in decline, but I submit that the objective of our policy should be at least to slow down that decline, if not to reverse it, and certainly not to adopt new policies that will accelerate the decline. I understand the reasons for the decline—the increased proportion of women who go out to work, the fact that, more often than not, there is no one in the house when the milk is delivered, or simply convenience—because people move around, it is easier to slip into supermarkets, which in some instances have been using milk as a loss leader. I understand the reasons for the decline in the doorstep delivery system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Kynoch 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kincardine and Deeside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some minutes ago, the hon. Gentleman talked about the lack of competition and doorstep prices. Now he talks about the effect of supermarket supplies. Do they not have a greater effect on keeping down doorstep prices, possibly to an uncompetitive level? Producers are being forced to consider prices for doorstep delivery because supermarkets are selling more and more milk. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that people being out at work is the reason why doorstep deliveries are declining. I suspect is purely pricing at supermarket level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is entitled to his view. Having said that, many people continue to choose to have their milk delivered to the doorstep. I suspect that, sadly, in some parts of the country, one of the reasons for the decline in the doorstep delivery service is the fact that people no longer risk allowing their milk to sit on the doorstep for any length of time because it is likely to disappear. I do not necessarily disagree with the hon. Member for Kincardine and Deeside (Mr. Kynoch). Perhaps pricing has been the most potent factor, but that does not alter the fact that many people still depend on a doorstep delivery service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some figures from the National Dairymen's Association, which document the decline. In 1980, 90 per cent. of liquid milk was sold through doorstep delivery services whereas in 1992 the figure was 56 per cent. That is still a lot of milk and a lot of people. Surely what is important is that the service remains available to those who want it. We are reaching the stage where the service will not be available in many cities. The fewer people who buy such milk, the less economic it becomes for the service to operate. If milk is delivered to only three out of 100 houses in a street, that is far less economic than if 60 or 70 houses out of 100 are having milk delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the reasons for the decline in the percentage of liquid milk being sold by the doorstep delivery service, we should try to maximise the amount of milk sold through that service for the benefit of those who want to take advantage of it. We could be moving to a situation in which the
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
proportion of milk being sold through the doorstep delivery service is such that the service will spiral into greater decline because it will not be economic to provide the service in some of our cities as it has hitherto been provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises the issue of employment. That sector of the milk industry provides thousands of jobs. What has been said on that is clear. I have before me a copy of a radio interview, which I heard early one morning on "Farming Today". Mr. Derek Beresford, a member of the milk marketing board, was being interviewed by Mr. Stennett.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Stennett said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We produce less milk than we use here in this country. Does that mean that, if the manufacturing price goes above the liquid milk price, we could actually see liquid milk shortages in the market, people who've been paying a premium in the past not being able to get their milk?"</p></blockquote>
Mr. Beresford, the milk marketing board member, replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is theoretically possible. I think that we—do have a duty to sustain the liquid market but we must remember that the doorstep delivery is one that is a high labour content and that the bottle milk buyer has a lot of problems with labour, with deliveries, smaller deliveries due to people buying from the supermarket."</p></blockquote>
Mr. Stennett went on to ask him:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So you could see the doorstep delivery being squeezed by increased costs, lack of … supplies and more milk going into the supermarkets?"</p></blockquote>
Mr. Beresford replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is true. And it's something that we have to address. I, for one, and I'm sure a lot of my colleagues are wanting to … sustain the doorstep delivery as long as we possibly can."</p></blockquote>
The trouble is that pious words will not sustain the service. We need pricing policies that will help to sustain it. Under current pricing arrangements, liquid milk commands a premium price. So milk will go to that liquid sector before it goes to the manufacturing sector. We have recently seen an increase in the manufacturing price and, I suspect, that there is little difference between the manufacturing price and the liquid price, but that is an unusual development. It would be worrying if we were to create arrangements whereby, because the supply of milk is constrained, the price will be forced up and competition for that limited supply of milk will be such that the doorstep delivery service will further decline and, possibly, sharply decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are creating arrangements that could do great damage to the milk industry. We can be proud of the service to the consumer. We have the highest quality milk in Europe, an advanced doorstep delivery service and excellent arrangements for the supply of milk to the whole country. We believe that the statutory arrangements could have been adapted and made more flexible to allow for some of the changes sought by the Minister. Instead, we are going down a very dangerous road, which will lead to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
price of milk rising sharply, and which will threaten the doorstep delivery service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies, he may refer to clause 3(2)(b), which requires the Government, in considering reorganisation schemes, to be sure that,
	<br><blockquote><p>"it has consulted about the principles of the scheme such persons appearing to it to be representative of the interests of producers, purchasers, retailers and consumers of milk as it considers appropriate."</p></blockquote>
That is not adequate. We want some explanation from the Government of the action that they intend to take to prevent the worst excesses from developing in the marketplace, which could become dominated by one very large producer co-operative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Mr. Hill, may have coupled amendment No. 80 with the amendment No. 57, but I assure the Committee that there is little common ground between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 80 was intended to be a probing amendment, as I fully support the Government's view that the scheme of reorganisation should be proposed by the boards. It would be wrong for us to dictate to the boards their future. I agree with what the Minister said earlier. The boards should develop their own future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In tabling the amendment, my aim was to use the Committee to drop a strong hint to the boards from the food processors, which are important customers, about their concerns and what they would like to see included in any reorganisation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the restricted market, which we have already debated at some length, the food processing industry would especially like to examine the considerable number of details in the reorganisation scheme when the boards bring them forward. The industry wants details of arrangements for pricing, of the continuity of supply and delivery and of means of settling a dispute, to be clearly spelt out. The market is restricted and most members of the Committee would welcome Milk Marque and would wish it a good future. It will provide an important service for the many farmers who will continue to use it. I suspect that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East slightly exaggerated the total share of the market and that, in England and Wales, it may be less than the 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. to which he referred. Nevertheless, the market will be restricted because of the capped quotas. In that respect the food processors should be reassured that no official action will be taken against them and that they will not be discriminated against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to give us the same assurance as he gave on amendment No. 33. I was heartened to hear his remarks on that amendment. Much the same would apply to amendment No. 80. I hope that he will ensure that the scheme will contain a considerable mass of detail on such sensitive matters. Before the scheme is set in stone, those details should be published so that some form of representation can
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
be made by the food processing industry and by hon. Members. I do not want to commit the Government to the laborious consultation process that has been suggested today, but we should all appreciate an opportunity to make important points on the scheme before it is finally agreed on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Transitional arrangements are always rather uncomfortable and contain an element of chicken and egg. If the framework is set up in a particular way, it will lead to a particular conclusion. Before we know where we are, we will have set in concrete something that we meant to develop naturally. That is particularly true when we examine the questions that arise from the inevitable uncertainty surrounding the proportion of producers who will join Milk Marque in England and Wales. Significantly, the excellent brief that the milk marketing board has provided us includes a key sentence with an important "if in its middle. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There should not be concern if Milk Marque accounts for a high proportion of milk production."</p></blockquote>
Any sentence that includes "if in such a prominent place always makes me look askance at what follows. It is extremely important for us to examine other scenarios, however hypothetical they may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that, instead of Milk Marque achieving a 90 per cent. or higher share of the market—many producers hope that it will achieve that proportion because it will evidently be the right vehicle for their future aspirations—it proves not to be a success and achieves only a relatively low percentage of producer sign-on. Let us invent an entirely hypothetical company called Great British Nestle plc and suppose that it manages to sign up an enormous number of people. By doing so, it links up with other member state companies and, therefore, finds itself able to create a distortion of the market that no member of the Committee can foresee. The whole of that paragraph from the milk marketing board's brief would fall by the wayside and there would be a completely different situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transitional arrangements are difficult to foresee. Those of us who are currently grappling with the absurd blunders that have occurred as a result of the transitional arrangements for council tax or for the poll tax will understand that transitional arrangements are all too often a very damaging feature of any change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that when the Minister replies he will give some guidance on the vexed question of commercial confidentiality, to which the amendments clearly relate. When moving from a statutory, managed market, commercial confidentiality is inevitably a difficult nettle to grasp. The precise working of the amendments may not be adequate to the task and many of us are worried about the lack of clear guidance on how the transition will take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson). My concern is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0034">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
not for the food processing industry, which consists of big boys who can look after themselves, but for others who are worried about the way in which the transition may take place. I have in mind independent milk producers and processors—small organisations that cannot use their muscle in a free market the same way as the large processing companies and supermarkets. They believe that if we are not careful we may
	<br><blockquote><p>"perpetuate in the free market some of the worst aspects of the old monopoly regimes."</p></blockquote>
They are worried that in
	<br><blockquote><p>"the absence of any proper control of the abuses of their monopolies by the MMBs in their final days"</p></blockquote>
new problems may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in responding to what the hon. Member for Hexham referred to as a probing amendment the Minister will not be dismissive of the anxieties felt by many organisations. We keep saying that we are moving into uncharted seas. An uncharted sea of milk is rather formidable—it costs a great deal of money and can make or break many people. When some Opposition Members received envelopes a short while ago, some of them seemed to think that they contained milk cheques because their faces lit up. Many generations of dairy farmers throughout the country regarded that regular income as their main standby, and it has been their life-line during difficult times. The hon. Member for Bristol, East (Ms Corston) did not receive her "milk cheque" and I am glad to see that it has now arrived.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people in the dairy sector are worried, and it is they and the intermediary organisations that make it possible to deliver the daily pinta, for which we have a responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the transitional arrangements are so vague that a coach and horses can be driven through them to the benefit of other organisations, we may live to regret it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the market moves steadily forward and the majority sign up to a genuine producer co-operative, we may feel that safeguards are less important, but we cannot be sure of that now. In those circumstances, I hope that the Minister will take seriously the anxieties that have been expressed this morning on behalf of many people in the industry and that he will give some reassurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) started by referring to a chicken-and-egg position. I remind him that the Egg Marketing Board was abolished some time ago, and we may refer to that in detail when we discuss assets. I know from consultations with farmers in my area that small producers were less than happy at the way in which that matter was handled, and there may be some lessons to be learnt. I flag that in advance for the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
We are discussing an industry in which there is not and cannot be a free market. The briefing paper from the milk marketing board seems to be based on clauses from standard textbooks on the way in which markets operate but it ignores the fact that the milk market will not be a free market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Strang) referred to the effect of quotas on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its briefing the milk marketing board states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"In the free market, prices will be determined by the interplay of the forces of supply and demand. There will be free bargaining between buyers and sellers."</p></blockquote>
That will not be so. Against that background, it would be wrong if the Committee did not explore deeply the way in which the market started to evolve in its semi-controlled way with the Minister not being deterministic but nevertheless having a significant influence on what happens in a difficult period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister refers in his briefing paper—it was sent to all members of the Committee, for which I thank him—to an orderly transition and that phrase arose during discussions with farmers last weekend. They are deeply concerned about the need for an orderly transition and we must consider the arrangements for pricing, delivery and means of settling disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The milk marketing board states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"means of settling disputes would enshrine an out-dated concept"—</p></blockquote>
that is an odd thing to say because I thought that we were in the business of settling disputes—
	<br><blockquote><p>"utterly inappropriate to the free market in milk. In the free market, disputes will be settled between the parties or by the courts, just as in other industry, or by any arbitration the parties may agree to use."</p></blockquote>
We shall end up by paying the lawyers with the price of our daily pinta if we take that argument to its logical conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the very complex transition, there should be a series of regulations to ensure that there is adequate protection for producers through the chain to the consumer. The uncertainties that have already been described lead me to believe that the principles embodied in amendment No. 57 should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by saying that my hon. Friend the Member for Workington was handing out not milk cheques but a requirement for us to do more work in the Committee and he was not offering any premium payments, which I regret.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not attempt to follow the various analogies. When the hon. Member for North Cornwall referred to a sea of milk, I could foresee that churning into butter and before long we would have come to the Aenied and the wine dark sea and other agreeable but not very helpful analogies.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
Whenever the Opposition are about to be at their most dogmatic, they begin by accusing me of being dogmatic. They accused me of having dogmatic determination to do something and then said that they want to recreate the milk marketing boards in a twilight existence in the free market. The Opposition seem to want to construct a framework of regulations around the marketplace—a sort of dirigisme. That is the dogmatic approach. It is not dogmatic to say, "Let the market decide." The dogmatic approach is to say, "Not quite." That will not work. That intermediate approach is unnecessary and that is true of the amendments. It is difficult to conceive how a statement of trading practice could not cover pricing, which is such a central issue. To be honest, to ask that it should cover allocation is objectionable because it looks as if the dear old MMB, under another guise, is pretending to do all the things that the MMB was doing. The MMB must take a view of what happens to the nation's milk supply because it has a statutory monopoly—it cannot avoid that. The reason for moving into a different world is that it will not have to take a view of what happens to the nation's milk supplies. It will not be the great lactating grandmother of the nation. It does not need to be. I did not want to induce mirth in the hon. Member for North Cornwall in case his back is not better from the sad accident that he reported at the last sitting. I am glad that he appears to be on form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no point in indulging the cries for nostalgia, because the happy little ways of the milk marketing board and the Dairy Trade Federation, which propped one another up in their cosy little cartel did not work. That was not delivering what the nation wanted and, therefore, those organisations will have to live in a different environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Mr. Atkinson) tabled amendment No. 80. The last thing that I want Milk Marque to do is to talk about continuity, delivery and settlement of dispute. There is a marketplace mechanism which deals with those matters. I know that my hon. Friend wants a reassurance that when we examine the milk marketing board scheme we will ensure that the principles that will govern a competitive marketplace are in place and that a market can evolve. Of course, the board will want to make proposals to deal with what would happen if producers wanted to quit the scheme, the circumstances in which they wanted to quit the scheme and those in which they could join other schemes. Of course, those must be part of the deliberations and the analysis that we make; we will hear those concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that competition is a serious matter. As the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East said, there are two sides—a Community side and the national competition authorities. On the Community side, the Commission has given the board two years during which it will not inaugurate proceedings against it. If the Commission receives a complaint, it will have to investigate. Therefore, there is a stand-still in only one sense of the word. Clearly, the Commission will
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
be at liberty to pursue investigations in circumstances such as were suggested by the hon. Member for North Cornwall, who mentioned a mega-Nestle. There is no way in which we could, even if we wanted, restrain the Commission from pursuing its obligations to its competition competences. The board has been given a two-year sporting chance to get the system going. In that sense, there is a transitional period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The OFT has had discussions with the milk marketing board and with the Scottish boards to give them guidance abou competition law as it would relate to the trading practices of Milk Marque and the equivalent organisations north of the border. Of course, the board will be sensible if it is guided by those principles, but I want to make it clear that the OFT is not in the business of providing letters of comfort. It will not give guarantees. The discussions are without prejudice and the OFT retains complete freedom of action in relation to Milk Marque. Under the Bill's provisions, Ministers will have to judge whether the reorganisation scheme allows for the development of competition in milk marketing. That is our main objective and the board's provisions will contain those arrangements under which producers are able to quit or resign from an organisation and the conditions that would apply in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed about doorstep deliveries. I do not want to suggest that the Government do not appreciate the value of that service as much as any other person but the status of the milk marketing board has nothing to do with doorstep deliveries. My problem is that I understand the concern of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East, but not what it has to do with the debate on the future of the milk marketing board. There has been a transition. Whether it is to do with sociology, pricing or a mixture of reasons is something on which nobody can come to a definitive conclusion, except that there has been a change in the marketplace. The existence or not of the milk marketing scheme makes no difference to the existence of the doorstep delivery. Providing that people want and will pay for the doorstep delivery, that service will be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no transition in the sense that there will be intermediate status for the boards. When the statutory scheme ends, it will be instantaneously succeeded by the new arrangements. Until those arrangements come into effect the statutory scheme remains in place. We have a period of discussion and analysis of the proposals. It is a transition in political terms rather than in economic terms in the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the concerns that we should reach conclusions as rapidly as possible and that any uncertainty about a party's intentions should be dispelled so that producers know where they stand. The MMB will, no doubt, want to open its books for Milk Marque—the successor organisation—once Royal Assent has been obtained, but it will not be in the business of recruiting before that happens.

In the thrust of the debate we have been talking about pricing, allocation and, because of the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Hexham, disputes, to which he hardly alluded. Perhaps he intends to discuss amendments later that deal more clearly with dispute procedures. The MMB's brief, which was supplied to members of the Committee yesterday, advocates a central proposition to which I do not subscribe. We should consider that at this stage in our proceedings. There will not be a free market in milk. Eighty per cent. of the market might be dominated by one broker, which is how Milk Marque should be regarded. It will be nothing more than a broker, but we shall discuss that later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that happens, if there is an 80 per cent. domination of the market, we should consider the MMB's comments. It would not be concerned if Milk Marque were to account for a high proportion of milk production. In its briefing document, the board states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The United Kingdom market, because of its long history of free trade, has extremely well developed supply lines from the ports to the main urban centres of population, making it one of the most open and competitive markets in the world for dairy products. The EC produces some 12 per cent. more milk than is required for its domestic consumption, and should the farmers who become members of Milk Marque account for three quarters of the milk produced in England and Wales, this would only represent 8 per cent. of the total EC milk production".</p></blockquote>
The reality is that there is a channel which determines much of what happens in British agriculture. We have tabled amendments that relate to potatoes, and much of the thinking behind them is geared to our perception of the channel and how it affects domestic markets in the United Kingdom. The Minister may use the channel in support of his arguments about potatoes, just as we shall, although in a different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assumption behind the MMD's stance on pricing, however, is that there is no channel. It seems
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
to think that a milk tanker can be sent over the border to pick up from northern France and deliver to a dairy in the United Kingdom, but the system does not work like that. The reality is that when Unigate went to France to pick up milk, it provoked a row in the south of England. Many articles appeared in the local press about the British people having to drink foreign milk. People were interviewed in the street. There were "vox pops" and entire pages on what Mrs. Jones said about milk imported from France. In reality, it was never a commercial proposition. If we want to import raw milk from France in this so-called free market, it will cost 5p a litre. Anyone who doubts that should contact the companies that have been trying to import raw milk. That is the cost of sending over an empty tanker to bring back milk, whether it is a 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 litre tanker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who think that the channel tunnel will somehow secure access to cheap milk from Europe may find that they, too, have made a mistake. Channel tunnel costs will be based on the existing costs of those responsible for taking freight across the channel in today's conditions. To cut the price from 5p a litre, it is necessary to provide for a two-way load and, because tankers can carry only dairy products, we can send only cream. So, we could send cream to France to enable us to import raw milk, that is a ludicrous proposition. The French have milk surpluses, are way over quota and do not need our cream.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not a free market in the sense that Ministers and the MMB would have us believe. The market is ring fenced. It is a deficit market, and we shall pay a very high price to import raw milk. Indeed, I understand that it is possible to import only UHT milk into the United Kingdom. Technically, we could import any milk, but I am told that we import only UHT. That is because UHT is the product made in European countries when they have no other use for their milk. It is almost like a sink product, which begs a question. If it is a sink product, are not there conditions in which we may receive UHT milk into the United Kingdom at prices below its cost to manufacture abroad? Ministers might like to say a word or two about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I foresee that, in future, when the general agreement on tariffs and trade round has worked its way through—this will be due to a loss of export subsidies and the fact that the extra capacity for milk in Europe will have to be absorbed by European markets rather than exported and supported by export subsidies—we may find ourselves under pressure to take much more UHT milk from countries that want to get rid of their milk surpluses. That is not an original thought. People directly involved in the industry say that that might happen. Ministers should bear all these matters in mind when they approve schemes. They say, of course, that they cannot do that because they do not want to adopt the Big-Brother approach of telling people what should happen in the market, but we have never suggested that they should do so. Ministers should bear in mind
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
questions of pricing, allocation and disputes when they take decisions on whether to approval schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers say that the competition authorities provide the framework in which decisions should be taken, in the event that there is a distortion in the market. I do not want to want to delve too deeply into the question of disputes procedure. Disputes, arbitration procedures and regulators to some extent short circuit the possibility of the Dairy Trade Federation membership having to resort to the courts, the Community or the Office of Fair Trading. The Minister has already spoken, but he could at some stage outline his views on resolving disputes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I learnt after our Thursday sitting that my parliamentary predecessor in Workington, the late Fred Peart, insisted on referring to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as the Minister. Perhaps I shall have to dissent from my predecessor's view. In response to an intervention that I made on the Floor of the House, the person whom I insist on referring to as the Secretary of State, said that his mind was open, not closed. Will Ministers tell us what their state of thinking is?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day I asked questions about assets. That questioning certainly helped us when we came to consider that issue on the back of a series of amendments. So will the Minister refer to disputes? The subject is included in amendment No. 80 and yet the Minister did not comment on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was provoked by what he said at the beginning of his speech. He was at great pains to say that it was inappropriate for the Labour party to suggest that we should retain certain powers to regulate and direct in the free market that he wants to create. I had never previously regarded the Minister as a free market fundamentalist but that was how he tried to project himself today. His argument contained a fatal flaw. A free market cannot exist for a commodity whose supply is restricted by statute. There is a shortage of milk in the United Kingdom market, which has been imposed by regulation from Brussels and through the British Government. I do not argue with that. I think that there is a powerful case for restricting supplies of milk because of existing circumstances and I support the principle of the quota system, but the Minister cannot have it both ways. He
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
cannot say that there will be a completely free market while maintaining tight control of production. In the context of the amendments, I hope that he will address the likelihood of discrimination between different sectors in the market, given the restricted supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East addressed the difficulties that are likely to face the doorstep delivery system, which the Minister accepted as a socially useful system of delivering milk. It is helpful in that it provides jobs but, most importantly, it ensures that many people who might have difficulty in gaining access to supermarkets, shops or other sources of liquid milk, have it delivered to their doorsteps. The system is useful and good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can all visualise circumstances in which manufacturing might become the most profitable sector of the market. When decisions are made about who will receive how much of the scarce supply of liquid milk, more of it might be moved to the manufacturing sector and further penalties might be imposed on the liquid milk delivery system to the doorstep. The doorstep delivery system is socially useful but commercially fragile. I fear that we are creating circumstances in which that fragility could lead to further discrimination against the doorstep delivery system. It would be useful if the Minister considered that and tried to understand the Opposition's argument that there is a case for seeking safeguards to ensure that the doorstep delivery service will continue to receive the required supply under a suitable pricing structure so that it can survive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On UHT, one cannot argue simultaneously that there is no competition from imported milk and that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
we shall be overwhelmed by imports of UHT. I recall that when, years ago, Detta O'Cathain—as she was then—was one of the many people who worked for the MMB, she talked about ultra-horribly tasting milk when we fought the great battle of milk imports. The entire population was to be knee-deep—I say knee-deep because the substance is fairly viscous—in UHT milk. Since then, I notice that British companies make quite a lot of UHT themselves. I some places, it is quite difficult to avoid it. I have to suffer particularly noxious substances in Brussels, where they serve some incredibly murky-looking substance in coffee. Any genetic link with milk has entirely escaped me. Despite all my efforts, even the British presidency did not succeed in getting real milk on the coffee tables in Brussels.

The hon. Member for Workington makes a serious point but it is not related to the future of the milk marketing board. It is true that some of the dairy processing companies are concerned about the requirement in the Blair house agreement on subsidised export limitations and the implications that that might have for the export from the Community of some processed products, such as condensed milk. It is a different point, which will be covered at a later stage in our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 27, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(e) a statement of the detailed arrangements for the distribution of assets to registered producers who choose not to join or become members of any successor body; and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(f) a copy of the rules or by-laws or other constitutive documents relating to any successor body.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would require detailed information to be provided to Ministers by boards when applying for a scheme or reorganisation under clause 2(1). An application would have to include a statement on the distribution of assets to producers that do not join Milk Marque or other successor authorities and a copy of the rules relating to the successor body. I do not intend to prolong discussion on the amendment because we have several amendments to move before one o'clock and I want to stay on schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
The amendment might appear to be nit-picking, but there are serious issues behind it. Without going into the debate on assets, it concerns the use of marketing tools by the milk marketing board in securing an easy passage for the setting up of a successor authority. I want to quote an example of how, in a small way, one can use one's assets to secure contracts from producers. Some in the milk marketing board will argue that this is not a good example, but it has been drawn to my attention by three different sources in the industry outside the board. Some believe that it is an indication of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An article in 	<i>Farming News</i> on 2 April 1993 on insemination fees stated that The basic insemination fee charged by GENUS marketing stays at £7.35 for all farmers paying by producer offset or direct debit. For settlement by cash or cheque, the fee will be £12.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A differential for a fee or charge by GENUS is built into the settlement arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article went on to say that the new pricing structure included fixed price contracts. Over the past ten years, the basic AIP has risen by an average of 7 per cent. a year, but by holding charges at 1992 levels the cost has dropped in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Farmers can also opt for an individual contract, which fixes an annual fee for a total AI service geared to their needs. Terms will vary depending on individual requirements for an AI service and are subject to satisfactory fertility management and animal identification, options include multiple daily visits and time quotes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue raised by those who wrote to draw that to my attention was that, if that sort of thing were to happen during the coming months and during the vital period at the end of the year, it would show how, even in invoicing a product, one could receive a discount in price if one remains a client. In going outside the membership base, even in the settlement of accounts with the milk marketing board, or with that organisation, which, in effect, belongs to the milk marketing board, one might be able to angle the offer and provision of services in such a way that one is drawn into an obligation with the milk marketing board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the milk marketing board does not see it like that, but that is the view of people outside for which I have three different sources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People at the back of the Room were nodding as I was reading the article because they clearly recognised the truth in what I said. That is only one small example. I am sure that more will arise during the oncoming months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People in the industry have expressed their concern that, because the milk marketing board has all those historic relationships—it determines the financial security of 29,000 dairy farmers throughout the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0039">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
United Kingdom—it will be in a position to use its assets to secure its future. That would be very wrong. If Ministers will talk about free markets, they must commit themselves to the principle of level playing fields. As the debate develops, everything suggests that there will not be a level playing field, especially during the critical forthcoming 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped to have another example of the activities of GENUS, but, unfortunately, I was unable to secure access to that information. I understand that a dispute took place in the north of England between those who were to provide me with the information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my next point. I believe that, in many of the meetings that have taken place in the United Kingdom, in which the formidable Mr. Dare met Mr. Haskins in some sort of Punch and Judy show, many people in the audience have not been prepared to speak up. The reason for that is simple; they are worried about their position. They believe that, if Milk Marque dominates the market with more than 80 per cent. it will be in a powerful position to determine the future of individual producers, who are not prepared to put their heads above the parapet. Yet such issues worry them. They do not know whether they will get a fair deal. I know that Mr. Dare has given repeated assurances that they will receive a fair deal. I am sure that that is his intention at this stage. However, the question is whether, when it comes to the minutiae of decision taking, it will be possible to treat all those people absolutely fairly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recommend that the Committee oppose the amendment, but I hope none the less, that I might be able to say something that the hon. Member for Workington and other members of the Committee will find helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require the board to present to Ministers, along with its reorganisation scheme, a statement of the detailed arrangements for the distribution of assets to producers who do not join the successor body, and a copy of the rules of any successor bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill already requires the board to supply that information in the reorganisation scheme rather than in a statement that would be annexed to the scheme. That provision is found in schedule 1 (14), which requires a board to specify which rights are to be conferred on all those who
	<br><blockquote><p>"under existing arrangements, would be entitled to share in any surplus assets on a winding up of the board."</p></blockquote>
It does not distinguish between producers on the basis of their future trading intentions—on whether the English and Welsh boards sign up to Milk Marque. Schedule 1(12) requires the board to include in the reorganisation scheme the constitution of any successor body and the details of legislation under which it would be registered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that concerns have been expressed about assets. My response is somewhat guarded
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
because, as the Committee will appreciate, when the board's proposals are eventually delivered, I shall have a judicial role to play and, therefore, I cannot prejudice the view that I might take in advance of receipt of those proposals. One is in the realm of a nod being as good as a wink to the blind man. I shall try to lay down a few principles that may be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The successor body must have some asset base in order to launch itself into its new existence. Nobody would dispute that that is a sensible stipulation. Equally, substantial compensation should be paid to all producers for the ending of the milk marketing board scheme. The board has proposed the distribution of 80 per cent. of its assets in the form of Dairy Crest shares. Those shares will go to producers, irrespective of whether they join the Northern Milk Partnership, the Nestle scheme, Milk Marque or the scheme that I think that M D Foods is suggesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of whether additional compensation should be payable to non-joiners, in respect of any assets that are given to the successor body, is more complex, involving moral, legal and economic dimensions. The Commission in Brussels has advanced legal arguments on this matter, concerning precisely compensation to non-joiners in respect of inherited assets. Those arguments need to be resolved. The Committee and the board must give considerable thought to that matter and we are taking legal advice. I put that frankly to the Committee, while admitting that I am unable to say whether there is a particular description that I would find acceptable. I do not have the means to do that without violating the terms of the legislation. It is relevant that people who join might be theoretical owners of assets but not in a liquid form other than if Milk Marque, not the milk marketing board, were wound up. As an alternative to compensating non-joiners, it would be possible to require that, if, were Milk Marque ever wound up, all assets would be distributed to the people who are to receive Dairy Crest shares. That would be one way of tackling the problem of assets. That is one of the hypotheses that the courts are considering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for what the hon. Gentleman said about differential fees for insemination. All members of the committee, including you, Mr. Hill, will know that, at various points, questions have been raised about national milk records, testing services, GENUS and the range of assets of the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) said earlier that it is important that producers should not be offered improper inducements to join Milk Marque, before a decision is reached on the board's scheme, all relevant matters must be taken into consideration. No decisions have yet been taken on apportionment of assets. The hon. Member for Workington should not assume that GENUS or any of the other assets will belong to Milk Marque.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to be helpful to the hon. Gentleman, knowing that a more substantive debate on assets may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
be appropriate later. In the light of that, I have tried to clarify the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I found the Minister's reply interesting and relevant to the amendment and to future amendments. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 55, in page 2, line 27, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(e) a statement as to the nature of what consultations have taken place with representatives of consumers and processors of milk.".</p></blockquote>
This is the first of a series of amendments on consultation, which has been at the heart of representations from organisations outside the House. The purpose of amendment No. 55 is to put pressure on the milk marketing boards to consult widely with consumers and processors before submitting schemes. The Bill is not the product of a model consultation exercise and during our discussions the Minister has referred repeatedly to the pressure of time that he is up against. To some extent, that has been exacerbated by the problems with the Maastricht treaty and the delay in introducing the Bill in this place. I do not see why there should not be maximum consultation to ensure that there are no mistakes. We have not opposed the proposal that the changes should be made from April 1994. We recognise the realities of the market and that we are part and parcel of the pressure on time. But there should still be the widest consultation with the industry, and I do not understand how the Minister can protest about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food issued a consultation paper in August 1992, but perhaps the Minister will explain why the responses were never published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hexham referred to detail and publishing. I listened to his speech with great interest and he made many of the points that I want to make. Detail and publication are very important. We shall continue to stress that and I hope that he will persist in voting for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Documents may still exist which members of the Committee might wish to see. We know that the dairy industry, many food manufacturers, retailers and consumer organisations have expressed various reservations about the Bill and some of them are very angry. They believe that the Government have been unreasonable and they want more consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My mind goes back to my earliest days as the junior Minister. One of my first meetings after my appointment in October 1992 was with the MMB, which took me to Thames Ditton, where I was given a superb lecture and I left thinking what a wonderful organisation it was. I was sure that there could not be
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
a counter case. But as soon as it was noted that I had been to Thames Ditton, I was beseiged with requests to put me right. As they came in, one after the other, from the retailers, the consumers and the processors, they started to tell me the other side of the story. I was concerned about the undertakings that I may have given while I was at Thames Ditton, but I think that I preserved my political credibility. A substantial counter-case was put, which can only come out during the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day, I sat down to wonder what it was that those organisations wanted to consult about. I am sure that Ministers will want to deal with that matter. Later on, in further amendments, I shall deal in detail with those areas where it is felt that there has been inadequate consultation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amount of consultation falls into the category of ostensibly reasonable matters. However, when it is considered, I wonder whether the amendment would really advance matters. We Ministers at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and at the Scottish Office are required by clause 3(2)(b) to consult representatives of consumers and processors of milk, among others, when we decide whether to approve a scheme. I believe that it is our job to do that and, for the reasons that I stated earlier, that it is the board's job to put the bid to us. The amendment would require the board not to consult representatives of consumers and processors of milk but to describe any consultations that it or anybody else had performed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that sense, the amendment is defective but I do not take refuge in that. I think that the amendment requires the board to do a job that quite properly belongs to the body which must authorise—or not—the scheme. Nothing in the Bill prevents the board from consulting processors and consumers when formulating its proposals if it so wishes. As Ministers will carry out consultations, preliminary consultations by a board would not be relevant to their consideration of its reorganisation scheme. We are in the realm of unnecessary duplication. On that basis, I invite the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"the board has taken all practicable steps to make full details of the scheme and other documents referred to in section 2(2) available to persons who are registered producers".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would tighten the Bill and it brings me back to the question of detail which was referred to by the hon. Member for Hexham. Perhaps he might care to intervene to emphasise the point that concern is being expressed outside about the inadequacy of details of the Bill being made available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The board's reorganisation scheme will probably consist of the mass of technical detail relating to its property rights and liabilities. It is not essential for all of that to be published for producers to be able to form a view on the proposals. It is important that those concerned should be able to form a judgment on the overall effects of the reorganisation scheme on their interests. The Bill provides for that by requiring the board to publicise to producers the principles of its scheme. To distribute the full reorganisation scheme right down to what will happen to the inkwell on the chief executive's desk would impose an enormous burden and would not clarify the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the hon. Member for Workington wants full information to be given. The board would be daft if it did not give full information because it is trying to sign up producers: not to give information would be self-defeating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the amendment is necessary, although I appreciate the sentiments behind it. The board will no doubt wish to take note that the fullest information will give the producers what they need to make a decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can labour the point a little longer because I think that Ministers are riding over this matter. On amendment No. 16, the DTF has stated that clause 6 deals with the withdrawal of approval in the light of material changes of circumstances. It believes that the clause should be amended to provide that the board should disclose details of the change to interested parties, in the same manner that is provided for in clause 3(2)(a) and (b) in relation to the proposed scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DTF's membership buys more than £2 billion of milk from the milk marketing boards. It has a huge membership, including thousands of people working in processing throughout the United Kingdom and, with a turnover on that scale, it has expressed dissatisfaction with the consultative arrangements. Why cannot its views be taken into account by Ministers when they make decisions?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DTF has repeatedly referred to the absence of detail. A whole string of people have rung my office and have sent letters to hon. Members about the absence of details of the schemes. Why cannot that detail be dealt with? Why cannot Ministers consult on detail and give the industry access to the information that it needs when it is seeking to protect its own interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 8 states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"without prejudice to the generality of the obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b) such steps shall not be deemed to have been taken unless the Board has put in place arrangements to allow copies of the scheme and the other documents referred to in section 2(2) to be made available to any person demanding it within a period often days from the date on which the demand is received by the Board".</p></blockquote>
Why did the DTF go to the bother of employing lawyers to draft amendments? I did not draft this amendment because amendments that I draft are invariably not legally watertight. I am not a lawyer. Ministers are here to correct our amendments when they regard them as being serious and when they want to enshrine them in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received amendments drafted by lawyers for the DTF and by lawyers hired by companies in the processing industry. They are concerned that they are not being fully consulted. Those organisations have said that the matters should be dealt with in the Bill because it is the only opportunity to do so. In reply, we argue that, yes, we accept the proposition because this is enabling legislation, we are not dealing with the detail and therefore we have an obligation to ensure that the fullest possible consultation takes place. Ministers come back to us and say that they do not have the time to deal with detail because they are working to a timetable. The Opposition have accepted that it must be introduced by April 1994 and everyone is crashed into a system which does not provide for adequate consultation. Yet we are talking about an industry with a turnover in excess of many modern developed western democracies. Consultation is an important issue. I implore Ministers to take the views of the industry into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
account and to ensure that it is given access to every document available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A team of people in the DTF should have constant access to Ministers to enable them to see all documents throughout the process of approval. They should have a major input because the future of their industry is being determined. The industry belongs not only to farmers and producers, but to processors and dairymen. Some 120,000 people are involved in the industry a very large figure, if one includes everyone, even those who deliver milk. Serious issues are at stake and I cannot accept that Ministers are dealing with them reasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to amendment No. 24. The second sub-clause in clause 3 states—if I mix up clauses and subsections, it is because it is many years since I was a member of a Standing Committee. I have been working in Select Committees for the past eight or nine years. I think that the Minister has similar problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 3(2) states that the authority shall not grant the application unless it is satisfied that the board has consulted registered producers. It excludes purchasers, whereas clause 3(2)(b) states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the authority … shall not grant the application unless it is satisfied that it has consulted … producers, purchasers, retailers and consumers".</p></blockquote>
Why should the milk marketing board not also have to consult purchasers of milk prior to the authority carrying out its own consultation? Amendment No. 24 would secure that objective. I feel strongly about that and I shall press the amendment to a vote because it is important that people in the processing industry know that we feel strongly about the matter and believe that there has been inadequate consultation. The process has been driven through at great speed and therefore we should consult as widely as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was disappointed with the Minister's initial response. We face a genuine and serious dilemma. As the hon. Member for Workington said, there are several interested parties. He mentioned only one comparatively large-scale interested party, which falls within the definition of a big boy that can look after itself. I am more concerned with small organisations, such as direct sellers, producer processors and quality milk producers. At this stage in the development of the new marketing regime, they have cause for concern about the extent to which their interests are being taken into account and will be taken into account during the formative process that the Minister described, which we all acknowledge is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also true that consumers in this country are not well represented by the organisations available to them so the consumer interest has not been fully represented. The dilemma is that, in order to have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
strong producer co-operative—a really effective successor body—which I strongly support, as, I believe, does the industry, it must be recognised that many of the other organisations will want the degree of detail to which the hon. Member for Workington referred because they want access to commercially confidential information. They will potentially want to compete. The more they can extract as a result of the process, the better. It would give them strength. That strength would be entirely artificial, however, because in any other walk of life they would not have access to that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balancing act which we have to perform in Committee is that of trying to ensure that there is the proper detail for the necessary consultation with interested parties, whose future may be at risk or could be substantially affected by the new regime. I accept what the Minister said earlier about the extent to which he will have to consult, but it is important to ensure that interested parties have an appropriate opportunity for consultation. At the same time, we must be extremely careful that the successor body is not at the outset tied in a straitjacket by having to display every figure on which it will take its management decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the organisations will be competitors. Even if they are not direct competitors, they will still have an interest in weakening, not strengthening, the successor body. I anticipate that, when we deal with how assets are distributed, that will be our major dilemma. However, at this stage in our proceedings, I must register my disappointment that the Minister did not seem in his first response to have taken fully into account the industry's concern or the extent to which we had to try to perform this delicate balancing act. He is well known in the House for his ability to cross any sort of trapeze wire with enormous dignity and effective balance. I was disappointed not to have a display of his acrobatic techniques this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 84, in page 3, line 11, leave out 'and' and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(iii) that the scheme provides that the ownership and management of the milk marketing activities of the board shall be separate from the ownership and management of its milk processing activities, and'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to explore the situation in Scotland. The amendment was tabled before the recent announcement by the Scottish milk marketing board—by far and away the largest board in Scotland—that it had had a change of heart and planned to separate its commercial activities from its marketing side. To some extent, that has answered many of the concerns behind the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In last week's announcement, the Scottish milk marketing board talked about the complete separation of its two sides. Will the Minister explore the details of that split and say how separate the marketing side will be from the processing side?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recognise that there is more than one board in Scotland? The Aberdeen and District milk marketing board and the North of Scotland milk marketing board are significantly smaller than the Scottish milk marketing board and, equally, have operations to process milk as a purchaser of last resort. To split is perhaps an impracticable proposition in their cases. Will my hon. Friend confirm that he is directing his comments specifically at the Scottish milk marketing board and not at the other two boards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can indeed do that. I would have gone on to explain that the amendment is directed at the Scottish milk marketing board and not at the North of Scotland board or the Aberdeen and District board. I appreciate entirely that they have particular and singular problems. I was frightened of getting a dirk in my back from by hon. Friend the Member for Kincardine and Deeside who has a great affection for the Aberdeen and District board. My remarks are directed at the Scottish milk marketing board, which is far and away the most important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish milk marketing board proposes to build a Chinese wall between its Scottish Pride side
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
and its marketing side. We need to be reassured that there will be a genuine split between the two sides. In particular, the SMMB talked about having two boards—how far apart will those two boards be? Will there be any directors common to both? Who will, in essence, be the policeman for those arrangements?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question was outstanding. In England and Wales, Dairy Crest is to be floated and shares are to be traded—that is not the case in the scheme so far proposed by the Scottish milk marketing board. Will its shares be traded? What will there be for producers who do not sign up to the new-co-op? What arrangements will exist to enable them to get money and assets from the successor body?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, again on a question of detail, what measures will ensure fair treatment all round in the Scottish milk marketing board proposals? As I mentioned previously, we should like full details—I hope that the board will listen—of the board's proposals. It might help the hon. Member for Workington, who has locked onto me like a missile on the question of detail, if I try to explain what I mean by detail. The hon. Member for North Cornwall probably explained it. We want a sensible balance of detail, not a mass of legal stops and commas. We do not want details that would give away commercial secrets. I want general details so that outside organisations can make certain judgments about the proposals. It would be improper for us to force the milk marketing boards to reveal commercially sensitive details in their schemes for reorganisation. I do not want to go that far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Strang</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to follow the hon. Member for Hexham. Operations in Scotland and Northern Ireland are so much smaller than those of the England and Wales milk marketing board that the European Commission has given the Government carte blanche to do what they want with those boards. The Government, for better or worse, have decided that, notwithstanding the Commission's authority, Scotland should not be allowed to have a fully integrated co-operative. With that decision, which was based on the MMC's advice, the Scottish board had no alternative but to make alternative arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the new processor organisation will be autonomous. The shares of Scottish Pride will be traded only between producers, but may need not be Scottish producers or part of the Scottish equivalent of Milk Marque. The Government must decide whether to accept that as sufficient independence of operation between producers and processors. The hon. Member for Hexham alluded to that and I believe that it should be accepted. The shares may be owned by producers in England, Scotland and, although German producers would not want to own them presumably by continental producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position in Scotland is different from that of the milk marketing board in England and Wales and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
in Northern Ireland. The Committee has not had much time to consider the position in Northern Ireland, but it is very important. I was surprised to discover the the milk marketing board for Northern Ireland buys more milk than the Scottish milk marketing board. Milk is a very important part of the agricultural economy in Northern Ireland and I hope that the new arrangements will enable the processing arm there to move forward and to invest because investment is badly needed if it is to retain a position in the market place in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will resist the amendment, which is unnecessarily prescriptive. The smaller boards in the north of Scotland could be caught within the net and in a future arrangement might be badly inconvenienced if the amendment were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take seriously the point that was made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East about the special circumstances of the market in Northern Ireland and about the possible direction that the Northern Ireland MMB may wish to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are we really saying that the successor to the milk marketing board in England and Wales should be prevented forever from participating in such activities? That is also unnecessarily prescriptive. We should create a framework in which an effective new organisation can work on behalf of all its members and if it wants to participate in such activities we should see whether there is an overwhelming reason to prevent it from so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond to the issues that have been raised and assure us that he will not tie the hands of any of the successor bodies in the way that is recommended in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to use the amendment to tackle an important issue—what Milk Marque may do in the future. I have received an interesting document on the rules of Milk Marque Ltd, "model M 1991" which was published by the Federation of Agricultural Co-operatives (UK) Ltd. That document reveals the potential shape of Milk Marque at some stage in the future. The amendment states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the scheme provides that the ownership and management of the milk marketing activities"—</p></blockquote>
what I regard as the broking activities of Milk Marque
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be separate from the ownership and management of its milk processing activities".</p></blockquote>
I shall read through the rules of Milk Marque so that the Committee is aware of Milk Marque's future intentions. It wants more than 80 per cent. of the market, a share that many regard as a voluntary monopoly. As far as we can see, it will be unregulated because there is no statutory framework for regulation. It states that in future it wants to
	<br><blockquote><p>"carry on directly or indirectly for the benefit of its Members …
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
including the business of producing from milk cream, butter, buttermilk, cultured milk, evaporated and semi-evaporated buttermilk or cultured milk, milk-sugar…, cheese, whey preparations, milk powder, condensed whole or separated milk, casein, ice-cream, margarine and any other commodities of which milk is a substantial ingredient".</p></blockquote>
It also wants to
	<br><blockquote><p>"carry out such operations and to manufacture or deal with such goods … as may seem to the Board of Directors directly or indirectly to advance the interests of the Society … to carry on any other trade or business whatever which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, can be advantageously carried on in connection with or ancillary to any of the above mentioned businesses or is calculated directly or indirectly to enhance the value of or render profitable any of the property, undertaking, rights or privileges of the Society".</p></blockquote>
I understand that these are model rules, but model rules can be amended. We are talking about an unregulated organisation that wants 80 per cent. of the market. It will effectively control the milk market, and it has been required to divest itself of Dairy Crest. Inbuilt into its rules is consideration of the construction of new processing operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to carry on quoting for the benefit of members of the Committee. Milk Marque continues to state its aims which are
	<br><blockquote><p>"to act as agents, brokers or trustees, and to enter into such arrangements (whether by way of amalgamation, partnership, profit sharing, union of interests, co-operation, joint venture or otherwise) with other persons or companies as may seem to the Board of Directors to advance the interests of the Society".</p></blockquote>
In that provision, I see huge dangers. I may have misunderstood what the debate is all about, but I do not think so. The hon. Member for Hexham has tabled an amendment questioning the relationship. The document suggests that Milk Marque may want to enter into joint ventures, amalgamations, partnerships, profit sharing operations, unions of interests—whatever they are—and co-operation arrangements
	<br><blockquote><p>"as may seem to the Board of Directors to advance the interests of the Society".</p></blockquote>
I understand that if one is entering into a joint venture one does not necessarily put up the money. Perhaps one contributes something else, which in this instance might be milk. Perhaps I am exaggerating, but what I am suggesting might have an element of truth insofar as Ministers should consider such matters when they approve the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will Milk Marque look like in 10 or 20 years time? Will it be an organisation that has entered into all these unions of interests, arrangements of cooperation, amalgamations, partnerships, profit sharing and joint venture arrangements? Will it have so much linkage with the processing industry that it will have an interest in securing supplies for it at a cost to other organisations in the market, or perhaps even at the cost of a processing plant that will be in my constituency after the next general election when the scheme has been reorganised? I am not prepared to accept that those matters should be left to the free market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
The Milk Marque rules go on
	<br><blockquote><p>"to establish or promote companies … or otherwise acquire, hold … all or any of the shares … of any company … as the Board of Directors may decide … to co-ordinate, finance and manage all or any part of the operations of any company which is a subsidiary company or otherwise under the control of the Society and generally to carry on the business of a holding company".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Atkinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to pick up on what the hon. Gentleman is quoting. He is using what a company would call its memorandum and articles. Why should not Milk Marque, in a different guise, adopt such memorandum and articles? That would be perfectly reasonable and sensible. The rules do not contain a sinister plot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that there is no sinister plot. The problem is that Milk Marque wants 80 per cent. of the milk market. It wants to dominate milk supply in the United Kingdom and does not want regulation. It has sent us briefs opposing consultation. Why does it not want more discussion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends will be interested in what Milk Marque goes on to say in its rules. It will
	<br><blockquote><p>"contribute to … any political … or useful object, which it may seem to the Board of Directors to be in the interests of the Society or its Members".</p></blockquote>
I do not think too much of that but it exists. These may be model rules, but we are dealing with an organisation that wants 80 per cent. of the market. Are model rules satisfactory in that circumstance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not satisfied that, in an unregulated market, such an organisation should have rules that allow it to act in an unregulated way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Hexham is of extreme significance. I do not know whether he wants to press it to a Division—that is his decision. If it were my amendment, I would do so because of its importance. I do not want to delay the Committee unreasonably, but there is much more in the rules that would make interesting reading. Knowing your background, Mr. Hill, I am sure that you would find it especially interesting.
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
Perhaps the Minister will be able to respond to my comments. We must not write off the aims and objectives that are set out in the Milk Marque rules. The DTF membership will examine the document, and it might regard it as I do. The Minister cannot say that he knows what the market will be like in 10 to 15 years time. He cannot do that for the fishing industry and he cannot do it for the milk industry. We cannot predict what might happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a possibility that Milk Marque will be gloriously successful. In many ways, I hope that Milk Marque, if it is the successor body, will succeed, despite what I have said recently, although the MMB might think that that is not my view. I want it to succeed, however, in a regulated market. I do not want a free market in which people can be penalised. Documents such as the rules of Milk Marque may be models, but knowing the formidable Mr. Dare, I am sure that he did not leave model rules to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a motive behind approving the document. There were objectives, and I am sure that Milk Marque will pursue them, but its attitude will be that of Ministers; it will be restricted by the OFT, Europe and the courts as and when it needs to be restricted. All that I am saying is that we have the opportunity to incorporate some of the restrictions in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
