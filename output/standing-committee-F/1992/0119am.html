EMPLOYMENT PROTECTION IN HEALTH AND SAFETY<br><br> CASES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 168, in page 65, line 3, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"the health or safety of employees",</p></blockquote>
and insert "health and safety".—[<i>Mr. Michael Forsyth.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 169, 170, 172,173 and 174.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Dobson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Holborn and St. Pancras)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the amendments. The Minister, who has some knowledge of the far left, is in danger of sounding a little "workerist" in amendments Nos. 169 and 173, which get rid of that good old Tory description "employees" and substitute "workers". That substitution has a Merseyside-workers-of-old feel to it.<br><br>
We welcome the amendment and recognise that its aim is to extend that cover provided by the proposed changes in the law to all people at a place of work. That would include the staff of subcontractors. It is important to have such an extension, particularly when the growing casualisation of work means that ex-employees can be doing the same work, short term, on a free basis or on a rather peculiar semi-self-employed basis. Those people will now be covered by the term "workers"—however offensive that may be to them and some Conservative Members. We welcome that extension, which reflects the growing realities of the workplace.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as possible. If I make some of my points now, I shall not need to repeat them later this morning, when we discuss a number of clauses.<br><br>
We must carefully examine the role played by the Health and Safety Executive and how it operates, principally under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. I think that all hon. Members agree that that Act was a sensible and successful piece of legislation. By developing the structures that built on that legislation, the Act formed an important part of the work of the previous Labour Administration. I hope that doubters among the Conservative ranks will recognise the importance of the role played by trade unions in ensuring the effectiveness of the legislation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
The official statistics contained in the latest Health and Safety Commission's annual report, which is lodged in the Library of the House, set out the need for the amendments. It is clear from tables included in the report that the number of accidents among the self-employed, many of whom are subcontractors on sites run by other companies, has increased, even though there has been an overall decline. The report's summary states that
<br><blockquote><p>"after substantial reductions in recent decades employee fatalities appear to be levelling off at about 1.6 per 100,000 employees; … the fatal injury rate for the self-employed was markedly higher at 2.6, reflecting the number of injuries to self-employed people working in agriculture and construction. These two sectors accounted for 60 per cent of fatal injuries to the self-employed, but only 30 per cent of the self-employed people".</p></blockquote>
Those facts highlight the importance of what my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) has described as the "workerist" tendency of Conservative Members.<br><br>
We still have a long way to go in health and safety matters. There are 800 reported injuries per 100,000 employees, which is a large number. Table 1 in the HSC's report refers to that in detail. Unfortunately, the Commission is unable to give the same information for the self-employed. It is well known that there are many unreported injuries. After examining the fatality statistics, one could reasonably conclude that that figure is higher than what ought to be regarded as acceptable. I do not regard one serious injury or fatality as acceptable.<br><br>
The Government need to consider that problem and how it is dealt with in the Bill. Some important improvements are proposed. However, against the background of the drive towards a free market, in which a self-employed person running a small company does not have the resources adequately to consider the protection of his health and safety, and that of others, the Government need to be vigilant in promoting other aspects of their policy in relation to health and safety. The need to do that is by the statistics covering the self-employed.<br><br>
Another concern is that while we have made enormous leaps forward, the number of dangerous occurrences reported has not markedly fallen. It has, I think, levelled off at about 3,500 per annum for the past five or six years. As legislators, we must challenge the acts of employers and work with them. The research institutions continually advance our knowledge. When I first worked in a laboratory it was common practice to clean one's hands with benzene, which we now know to be a carcinogen. We did not have the knowledge to warn against that. Our knowledge about particular chemicals, substances and working practices is improving. We should keep constant pressure on both employers and the research institutions to ensure that the HSE is provided with up-to-date information from throughout the world.<br><br>
I shall refer to comparisons with other countries. We are better in some examples; in others we are worse. There are further illustrations. It was fairly common practice, as recently as the 1970s, for engineers who worked with equipment generating radiation to bypass safety switches to obtain access to the electronic components. As a country, we have made enormous advances. The threshold limit for asbestos, which currently stands, I think, at 0.5 particles per cubic m, would not have been considered as a standard 20 years ago. The Government are capable of keeping the pressure on both sides of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0595">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
industry and on the research institutions to ensure that that progress continues.<br><br>
I cited the examples of benzene, radiation and asbestos from cases with which I was familiar, in which people worked with highly qualified research staff at the frontiers of their fields. The important consideration is that if people working at that level fail to understand the characteristics of certain substances or working practices, how can the public, the self-employed and small businesses be expected to contain their excesses? There is a correlation between my earlier remarks about the self-employed and the incidence of accidents. That is why the clauses—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has been talking for some time. He is going wider than the amendments, which appear to me to be essentially technical. He may be spoiling his chance to speak later on more substantive amendments, when he will not be able to repeat his arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You, Mr. Knox, caught me in my last sentence. I was just about to conclude by saying that there is a correlation between the need to include workers, as distinct from just employees.<br><br>
I welcome the possible opening up of the clauses and hope that we shall experience a continuation of the Government's helpful attitude during our consideration of this part of the Bill.<br><br>
Finally, I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there are a couple of areas in which the change from "employee" to "worker" has been omitted. Perhaps the Government could look into that before the Bill reaches its final stages on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be necessary to explain the background to our reasons for tabling the amendment. As everyone knows, many accidents, injuries and fatal
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
injuries happen at work. We should do everything possible to prevent such accidents. Prevention avoids the harmful consequences of accidents: personal injury, death, loss of earnings, loss of production and in some cases, such as the Piper Alpha accident—if it is appropriate to describe it as one—the high costs that result from loss of production.<br><br>
There are other reasons why we should press for legislation to prevent accidents. Rarely is anyone punished for an accident at work. Few people are ever blamed, fewer are prosecuted, even fewer are found guilty or punished and very few indeed are severely punished for being responsible for an accident at work. Indeed, it could be argued that the best place to commit a murder is at the workplace because the murder is unlikely to be detected; the perpetrator is unlikely to be prosecuted or found guilty and, if he is found guilty, will only be fined about 30 quid.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Dr. Robert Spink <span class='memberconstituency'>(Castle Point)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that there have been hundreds of deaths in the construction industry during the past three or four years, yet a custodial sentence has never been passed on any employer or manager as a result?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of that. Many factors are responsible, not least the insurance companies which provide employers' liability insurance. I recall an occasion in my constituency when the Prudential Insurance Company Ltd. had buildings demolished and rebuilt. Fatal accidents occurred on the site, which could be viewed from the office of one of the company's bosses. The company provided the employers' liability insurance but, until I drew the accidents to its attention, the company was unaware of them.<br><br>
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Castle Point (Dr. Spink) for confirming my assertion that the chances of anyone being prosecuted are negligible. That position has not been helped by the Lord Chancellor's insistence on telling coroners that they must not blame corporate guilt for accidents. He was perturbed by the decision of the Dover coroners in the case of the Herald of Free Enterprise. They took an innovative decision which everyone considered to be a great step forward, but the Lord Chancellor decided to take a few steps backwards. The Opposition put much emphasis on the prevention of accidents, for obvious reasons, not least because avoiding accidents is all the more important if no person will be punished for his part in them.<br><br>
We welcome the new provisions as far as they go, first, because they are intended to assist people in concluding that their place of work is dangerous and that something should be done about it and, secondly, because they encourage what might be termed whistle blowing. Any encouragement of whistle blowing is welcome. Surveys show that a large proportion of the work force are unwilling to speak out on any topic, including health and safety at work, because with the prevailing high level of unemployment, they fear that they will get the sack.<br><br>
At the risk of upsetting some Government Back Benchers and perhaps further damaging the Minister's reputation, I must add that the proposals emanate from a European Community directive which states that an employer should, as soon as possible
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0596">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"inform all workers who are, or may be, exposed to serious or imminent danger of the risk involved and of the steps taken or to be taken as regards protection".</p></blockquote>
The employer should also
<br><blockquote><p>"take action and give instructions to enable workers in the event of serious, imminent and unavoidable danger to stop work and/or immediately to leave the work place and proceed to a place of safety"</p></blockquote>
and, except in exceptional circumstances and for reasons that the employer would have to substantiate,
<br><blockquote><p>"refrain from asking the workers to resume work in a working situation where there is still a serious and imminent danger."</p></blockquote>
Following approval of that directive, the Government introduced regulations which, as the Trades Union Congress pointed out at the time, did not deal with all aspects of it. Those regulations do not deal with the requirements of article 8(4) of the directive which provides that workers who, in the event of serious, imminent and unavoidable danger, leave their work station or the dangerous area and who are placed at a disadvantage because of their action must be protected from "harmful or unjustified consequences."<br><br>
We regard the proposals as a step forward. They provide protection for workers who stop work and for workers who leave their place of work. The proposals permit the employees or the "workers" as they are now described, following the amendments tabled by the Minister of State, Department of Employment, to take appropriate action when they feel endangered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for interrupting the hon. Gentleman, but it may help him if I explain that the Government are not being dilatory in carrying out their obligations under the terms of the directive. We could proceed with some matters by way of regulation and others by way of primary legislation. The matters that have been delayed and that have been covered in the Bill were delayed because they required primary legislation. The Bill provided the first opportunity to introduce such legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that the Government had been dilatory or had shown signs of wickedness in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could issue a press statement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Government would like to issue a press statement that I have said that, even though it would ruin my reputation.<br><br>
The problem with schedule 5 is that, as worded, employees who took what they regarded as the appropriate action of stopping work or of leaving their place of work because they truthfully believed that by staying they would be in imminent danger could later be held to have acted unlawfully if it were proved that they were not in imminent danger.<br><br>
The amendments insert the provision that workers would not be subject to claims of unlawful action if, at the time of their action, they had reason to believe that they were in danger. That would mean that if, when they left their place of work or stopped work, they had reason to believe that they were endangered, even if it turned out that they were not, they would still have been acting
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
lawfully, providing they had "reasonable grounds" for their belief.<br><br>
The straight, plain truth is that the amendment is important because people's lives and livelihood are at risk. When a person's life and livelihood are at risk, he is unlikely to ponder the lawfulness of whether to do a bunk from the place where he feels endangered.<br><br>
The straight, plain truth is that the amendment is important because people's lives and livelihood are at risk. When a person's life and livelihood are at risk, he is unlikely to ponder the lawfulness of whether to do a bunk from the place where he feels endangered.<br><br>
It is bad enough in the Committee Room. Papers might catch fire in a corner and engulf some of us in an inferno while the rest of us made for the door. But we do not work in intrinsically dangerous conditions. Many places that would be covered by the legislation are intrinsically dangerous and are only tolerable as workplaces because great care and attention are taken at all times.<br><br>
Incidents could occur at an engineering plant where molten metal is flowing around, flying around, lying around and being warmed up; in a chemical works containing many hot, nasty, burning and dangerous asphyxiants; in a hospital laboratory full of exceedingly dangerous pathogens; on an oil platform; or, as events in my constituency proved, in what appears to be an innocent place—the booking hall of an underground station. All those places can be dangerous.<br><br>
I do not think much of lawyers, even when they are balancing careful judgments in the court buildings on the Strand or at the Old Bailey. Nobody can carefully balance the niceties of the law in an intrinsically dangerous situation—in a steelworks or on an oil platform, for example. In such circumstances, the employees in question—those who are at risk and who, if they get it wrong, may die as a result of their indecision, hesitation and wondering—should have the benefit of the doubt in law. That is the purpose of our amendments.<br><br>
The amendments may be technically far from perfect and, almost certainly, need drafting improvements to achieve our aims. However, Government acceptance of the principle is important, so I hope that the Minister will accept it. As a special celebration, we might even get a couple of the amendments approved on the nod today instead of waiting for Report. Those who are present may shake their heads. Perhaps my hopes will be dashed. I hope that the Minister will be able to accept the principle of our amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help us to make progress if I respond briefly to the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman. I believe that a tribunal would be more likely than not to hold that the question whether there was in fact serious and imminent danger was to be judged from the perspective of the reasonable belief of an employee of normal fortitude. In other words, the bill already provides the result that the amendments seek to achieve.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Having spent the night considering wider matters, I am not sure whether I am a Minister of normal fortitude. I accept that there might be people who would argue that the danger had to be established as a scientific fact. That would be contrary to the spirit of the provision.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0597">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendments as drafted because they contain imperfections, but I am happy to undertake to table an amendment on Report to establish beyond doubt that the test should be that of reasonable belief.<br><br>
I should like to comment on the issues raised by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) of accidents and the Health and Safety Executive. We are concerned about the level of accidents, particularly among self-employed people working in agriculture or construction. That is one reason why the Health and Safety Executive's day-to-day work is concentrated in those sectors.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point said that there had been no custodial sentences in health and safety cases. In fact, there have been some suspended sentences. The decision about whether a penalty is appropriate is not one over which the Government or the Health and Safety Executive have an influence. It is a matter for the courts. We have acted to increase the penalties for health and safety offences by introducing the Offshore Safety Act 1992 and the Criminal Justice Act 1991. For the first time, a magistrates court can imprison for a health and safety offence.<br><br>
I hope that that reassures members of the Committee and that, as a result of my commitment, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras will seek to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's comments are extremely helpful. There is not much difference between our views.<br><br>
I should like to make a couple of points to the Committee and to ask the Government to consider, when they amend the clause in accordance with the Minister's commitment, the role of the safety representative who has been accepted by the employer and who is trained, it is to be hoped, by the HSC and the employer. Many safety representatives are also trained by the trade unions. The Minister should note that a significant proportion of the moneys removed from the Trade Union Congress's training programme were moneys allocated to health and safety training. The Minister appears to doubt that.<br><br>
We need to ensure that the person who is on the spot—at the sharp end—can make a decision. I think that the Minister acknowledged that that decision cannot be based upon absolutes except in extreme circumstances—as in, "The building is on fire: we must get out".<br><br>
Line 28 refers to judgment based on knowledge. That may not be absolute knowledge. Advice and facilities may not be available on the spot. Plenty of examples show that that is common. For example, on night shifts, a company's health and safety management team may not be on site, although they may be on call at the other end of a telephone somewhere. At bank holidays or during the Christmas period, hazardous enterprises must continue, but the level of direct cover may not be sufficient to ensure that absolute expertise is on the spot.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assist the hon. Gentleman in one respect. He is concerned about the withdrawal of the grant to the TUC for training purposes insofar as that relates to public expenditure considerations and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
health and safety implications. I can confirm that it is our intention to provide support for the Health and Safety Commission so that it can continue to provide training. I hope that will relieve at least some of his anxieties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for those comments. My earlier point was that the breadth of training will be affected by the restructuring of moneys provided. Perhaps the Government will further consider that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend take into account the views of Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU, who wrote in the January edition of the AEEU journal:
<br><blockquote><p>"Now the government seeks to destroy our training programmes for negotiators and safety representatives. The government, I note, is still intending to pay for management training."</p></blockquote>
It is fair to say that trade unions, both individually and through the TUC, do a tremendous amount of training of safety representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that observation. As I said earlier, I hope that the Government will carefully consider that in responding to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Spellar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a most extraordinary admission on the part of the Government that they may not even save money by withdrawing grant from the TUC. They are merely reallocating it out of spite to direct it away from the trade union movement, even though they have suggested that the trade unions were doing a bad job on health and safety training—if they knew that we were involved in health and safety training, that is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He is absolutely right to say that the Government's emphasis is wrong. It shows a failure to recognise what goes on in trade unions. In my trade union, for example, I suspect, because of levels of pay in the Health and Safety Executive—the national executive appointed a qualified health and safety executive officer. She is actively involved in promoting health and safety throughout the union and promoting the training of health and safety representatives. Such schemes should be continued, not curtailed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to stray too far from the amendment. I am sure that you, Mr. Knox, would pull me up for doing so. The hon. Gentleman should not be led astray by his hon Friend the Member for Warley, West (Mr. Spellar), who has now left the Room. The grant was used in part for health and safety training and the Government have told the Health and Safety Commission that they would be prepared to provide some support for their programmes in that area. I do not understand why the taxpayer should be asked to contribute to the cost of training trade union negotiators. On the question of health and safety, we recognise that there is a case for some support to be provided. That seems to be more appropriately done under the auspices of the Health and Safety Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall have to differ on that issue, unless the Minister is saying that he would welcome the Health and Safety Executive reallocating those moneys to the trade unions.<br><br>

To return to the amendments, it is important that the Government continue to promote health and safety. Reference was made earlier to the lack of criminal sanctions, but we have made significant progress. The offshore safety protection measures that were promoted and supported by the Government in the last minutes of the previous Parliament were an example of that.<br><br>
I remind hon. Members of the statistics. In the classification that includes banking, a significant number of accidents continue to occur. That is not acceptable. Therefore, while the Minister's words are welcome, I ask him to consider carefully the principle of the amendments and to adopt it on Report. The logic is inescapable. If we rely only on factors of absolute knowledge, the clauses will become meaningless. I am grateful for the Minister's earlier comments and hope that an appropriate accommodation can be reached between the parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members welcome any advance on health and safety issues as well as some of the comments made in response to amendments Nos. 144 and 145. The aim of the amendments is to strengthen the limited employment protection that is provided by the Government in the schedule.<br><br>
What is the reality of working in a workplace which has been deregulated? Again, the Government's attitude is paradoxical. Their aim, for ideological reasons, has been to deregulate the labour market. That has been an explicit Government aim, not least in their attacks on trade unions and employment rights, which they have persistently reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to understand what the hon. Lady is trying to tell us. I have said that I am happy to bring forward an amendment to meet the principles established by the Opposition amendment. The hon. Lady is attacking the Government for being deregulatory and is not taking on board the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Holbora and St. Pancras. Does she realise that I have accepted his comments and that I said that we would add to the regulatory burden in the light of those arguments?</span></p>
<p>[Sir Michael Neubert <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his comments. I was trying to say that although we welcome his agreement to consider the principle of our amendment, employees are subjected to enormous pressure in the workplace. The amendments only begin to take that pressure into account.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The proposals pose a paradox. The entire thrust of the Government's policy is to deregulate. Their argument is that any regulation of the labour market increases employers' costs. I want the Committee to consider the pressure in some workplaces. While any concession is to be welcomed, we need to consider seriously whether the schedule and the amendments go far enough.<br><br>
When the labour market is deregulated and there is a move to part-time work, particularly self-employed, contracted and subcontracted work, more pressure tends to be put on individual workers. The more profit that individual work forces have to make and the more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
competitive an industry has to be, the more tempting is it to cut corners. Good health and safety provisions increase costs—and quite right, too.<br><br>
How will the amendments improve working conditions in the construction industry where, at present, there is carnage? Three construction workers a week are killed on sites. Over the past 10 years, 1,500 have been killed. When we debate schedule stand part, I shall make the point that, while the concessions are welcome, they do not go far enough.<br><br>
The EC directive, which led to the schedule's inclusion, has been watered down in the new HSE regulations, which took effect from the beginning of this year. The original EC suggestion was that health and safety representatives should have the right not to be sacked—not simply to be able to claim unfair dismissal and get compensation, which is scant reward for losing their jobs because they have exercised their duties as health and safety officers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Olner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. Having worked elsewhere before coming to the House, before trade unions were shackled as they are now, can I refer to an incident in a machine shop where a particular coolant was used. After a week or so, the coolant started to strip the paint off the machines. When it was used on a particular component and on a cutting tool, the coolant on the cutting tool produced a mist when it was being used. The machine operators were inhaling the mist and obviously had "reasonable grounds" to suspect that their health was in danger.<br><br>
I accept that sometimes something is so obviously dangerous that it could cause fatalities. However, if someone's health is impaired as a result of chemicals being used, that person should have the right to insist that his safety should be fully protected. If the Minister will guarantee that the views expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras will be included in a Government amendment at a later stage, we shall not press this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I referred at an earlier sitting to difficulties in a factory in which I worked when the management and foreman did not realise that we were working with asbestos. Training in health and safety matters is vital so that the danger of products such as asbestos can be identified. The Government and management have a responsibility to ensure the health and safety of workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Olner</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's comment underlines my points. The workers involved in the incident to which I referred had to take industrial action before the company agreed to remove the offending and dangerous coolant.<br><br>
If the Minister tells me that he will ensure that workers have such rights, I shall be happy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Coventry, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the provision and the Minister's assurance that he will table an amendment on Report to ensure that people acting in good faith and reasonably will not be discriminated against. I urge him to ensure that his amendment is tightly drafted and expresses precisely our wishes.<br><br>
I, too, have personal experience of having to stop work in dangerous circumstances, with no legal protection. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0599">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
assure the Committee that that is not a happy position in which to find oneself. On the one side there is the risk to oneself and to those one represents, one's fellow workers. On the other side, there is the threat to one's livelihood and position if the management decides that that action is unreasonable and one loses one's job. It is essential for people to be in no doubt that if they stop work on a job when they have reasonable grounds to believe that there is a serious safety risk, they will be protected and will not subsequently find, if the perceived facts prove to be incorrect, that their employment is not protected.<br><br>
I turn to the European Community directive. The Minister implied that he was being attacked for having been dilatory in introducing the directive. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that that was not so. However, it is a shame that legislation of this nature is introduced through an EC directive and that we are not ahead of the game.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to stray by discussing matters that will be discussed later, but when we have finished our consideration of the schedule I hope that we shall have demonstrated to the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction that our provisions go beyond the terms of the EC directive. I agree with almost everything that the hon. Gentleman has said. It would be a pity if he spoilt his speech by introducing an unnecessary element of disharmony.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be welcomed by working people throughout the length and breadth of the United Kingdom if they could believe that their health and safety interests were being protected by Her Majesty's Government to a greater extent than is proposed by the EC directive. I would welcome the Minister's proof of that. It would certainly be a bit of an anomaly. We have heard the Minister's hon. Friends express concern from time to time about the creeping competence of the European Community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. The creeping competence referred to by my hon. Friends concerns the use of article 118A, which is about health and safety, to raise the issue of working time, which is not a health and safety matter. The competence of the Community in health and safety matters was agreed to by the Government in the Single European Act. We accepted that that should be dealt with at the European level. Creeping competence does not arise on the issue of health and safety, except in so far as health and safety provisions are being abused by people in Brussels, who have added to the cost of British industry through measures such as the working time directive and those referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Mr. Batiste).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be nice to hear whether the Minister's comments are supported by all his hon. Friend's.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste <span class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can assure the hon. Gentleman that that is so. We wish that the health and safety legislation of our Community partners was as good as ours. We are keen for the European Community to follow the high standards that we have set.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ainsworth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman ought to accept that there are probably different levels of health and safety enforcement in the EC. Some countries are much better at that than the United Kingdom; others are much worse. Surely we should try to adopt the best practices. If there is concern about the erosion of sovereignty, we should put ourselves at the forefront rather than at the back of dealing with that and many other matters so that we are not faced with the difficulty, which worries Conservative members, of an increasing number of people supporting the EC rather than their own Government. Subsidiarity would register in people's minds if they thought that this place, rather than the European Community, was protecting them.<br><br>
The Minister is absolutely correct when he says that punishment for employers found guilty of health and safety crimes is a matter for the courts, not the House. However, it is a matter of general concern to us. Comments were made the other day, with which I do not necessarily disagree, that the punishment ought to fit the crime, not the criminal. I think that working people believe that the legislative system has a greater affinity with employers in circumstances in which someone could have lost his life than with others who have inflicted the same damage on an individual and who receive greater punishment.</span></p>
<p>[MR. DAVID KNOX <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>Some people would take training budgets away from trade unions and give them to the Health and Safety Executive, in the hope that the job would be done better. That might be considered to be nationalisation of the service. We might welcome that in some areas. But that policy is related to prejudice against the job performed by trade unions. If people bear that in mind, they should be able to understand our concerns.</p>
<p>I worked for some time in the sheet metalwork industry. I was a member of the metalworkers union which subsequently amalgamated with the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union. A huge part of that union's work was to protect its members because of the type of trades represented and the type of jobs involved. The level of union expertise in some areas was second to none. It would be a great shame if that expertise was not accepted and was not considered to be worth protecting.</p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth) and I have expressed doubt about the latter-day conversion of the Government to matters of safety—I was going to say "death-bed conversion"; I only wish it were. I was perturbed by the definition of a person of normal fortitude. Perhaps employers who wish to attract workers into intrinsically dangerous places will advertise: "Only persons of normal fortitude need apply." I am of abnormal fortitude: I have an abnormally small amount of it in dangerous circumstances. Shakespeare said:
<br><blockquote><p>"conscience doth make cowards of us all"—</p></blockquote>
let alone danger. We must be careful, otherwise a lawyer at an industrial tribunal may sit and wonder whether someone displayed normal fortitude in jumping off an oil rig. There must be better things for lawyers to do—or perhaps not. It is a dangerous thought.<br><br>

However, we must thank the Lord for small mercies. In general, we welcome the schedule and the Government's commitment to the principle behind our argument. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 124, in page 65, line 18, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or (while the danger persisted) refused to return to,"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 125, in page 67, line 13, after "leave", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or (while the danger persisted) refused to return to,"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments would put the right to leave the workplace in dangerous circumstances on the same footing as the right to stop work, which we have just discussed and agreed. The principle—that people should leave when they have reasonable grounds to suspect that they are in danger—is accepted. The amendments would ensure that the same principle would apply if someone were asked to return to a place that they believed was dangerous. We believe that, in circumstances in which employees may lawfully stop work and lawfully leave the workplace, they should lawfully be able to refuse to return if it is dangerous.<br><br>
The EC directive requires that employers shall:
<br><blockquote><p>"refrain from asking workers to resume work in a working situation where there is still a serious and imminent danger."</p></blockquote>
I am unsure what the Government's response to the amendment will be. They may argue that it is already covered in the schedule, but, if it is not, the EC directive requires that it should be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras raised a point about the terms of the directive. The Management of Health and Safety Regulations 1992—specifically regulation 7, which came into effect on 1 January—already address the issue by placing requirements on an employer to give effect to appropriate procedures to be followed in the event of serious and imminent danger to persons at work in his undertaking.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman is concerned about placing beyond doubt the employee's position. I hope that it will not alarm the Committee too much if, having considered the amendment and the hon. Gentleman's comments, I recommend that the Committee accept the amendments as drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am almost lost for words. But for the Chancellor's unfortunate clash with Thresher's, I would suggest that we break open the champagne, or perhaps that we be given a half-day holiday. We welcome this move. We are absolutely delighted. I am moved almost to tears.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Batiste</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is not susceptible to the odd bottle of champagne, would he at least go so far as to recognise the Government's commitment to health and safety?</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>

<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 170, in page 65, line 23, leave out "employees" and insert "persons".—[<i>Mr. Michael Forsyth.</i>]</p>

<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos. 175 and 176.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take up much of the Committee's time on this issue. We welcome the amendment, which would delete the following words from the Bill:
<br><blockquote><p>"and any reference to the requirements of section 226B includes a reference to the requirements of the instrument of appointment under that section."</p></blockquote>
When we read that, we were utterly stunned and puzzled; we did not know what it referred to and thought that it had nothing to do with the schedule. Lo and behold, we were right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that its appearance was due to a word processing error.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My cheque is no doubt in the post, as well.<br><br>
We are seldom impressed by drafting—whether mine, endorsed as it was by the Government on the previous amendments, or the Government's—but this was a gem. You, Mr. Knox, may wish to take up with the Chairmen's Panel the fact that the paragraph was such a hanging, disorderly non-sequitur, that, had we tabled an amendment containing it, you, on the advice of the Clerk, would have ruled that amendment out of order. We need to consider whether the whole Bill should have been ruled out of order in the first place.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 149, in page 65, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) For the purposes of this section an employee shall be deemed to include off-shore installation workers and home workers.".</p></blockquote>
Again, I am not sure what the Minister's response to my comments is likely to be. That is one of the reasons for the Committee stage.<br><br>
The amendment aims to make it clear that all aspects of this part of the Bill apply to offshore workers and home workers. I must confess that I am not entirely clear whether the Bill as it stands would override the current offshore installation regulations which require that two or more safety representatives must conclude that something is dangerous before they can make safety representations to the manager of the rig or platform. Could the Minister clarify whether the proposals before us today override that provision? I hope that they do.<br><br>
We must recognise that special conditions apply offshore. The scale, complexity and potential danger of platforms make them unique places of work. There are many incidental dangers associated with platforms. They are large structures and, if someone falls off, the chances are that he will bump into something on the way down and kill himself or, failing that, will freeze to death in the sea as soon as he enters it. When something goes wrong, platforms are very dangerous places to be.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0601">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
As I said when the Government made their statement on the Cullen report, as much energy was discharged from the Piper Alpha conflagration as was discharged by the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. That is an example of the extent to which things can go wrong on a platform.<br><br>
Work on platforms has other characteristics which affect people's safety and their willingness or ability to assert their safety rights. Those characteristics stem from the fact that most platforms are offshore and isolated. In law, and, more to the point, in practice, the employer is in charge of a platform or rig. That is not the case with the land-based employer. The employer needs to be in charge if the platform is to be well managed, and for safety reasons. We do not object to that principle. Many regulations that apply to platforms are similar to those that apply on board ship. Some platform regulations bear a resemblance to the Incitement to Mutiny Act, 1797, although the provisions of that Act have been toned down and improved in recent times.<br><br>
The reality of life on the platform is that arrival on and departure from the platform is under the control of the employer. Employees can come or go in the helicopters provided by or permitted to land by the employer, or they can jump in the drink. Those are the only two methods of getting on or off the platform.<br><br>
It is difficult for employees working in such conditions to organise themselves. In addition,the employer who feels inclined to victimise employees has unique scope to do so. There is no doubt that there was considerable victimisation of employees in the North sea, some of which has continued. Many employees were blacklisted after one industrial dispute. As the Labour party made clear at the time of that dispute, the few employees who used violence against the management should not have been allowed back on the platforms. However, many other people were blacklisted and not allowed back. At the time, it was claimed that it would be impossible to run those platforms were such people allowed to return to work, but after representations by myself and others to the bosses of some of the oil companies, it was accepted that those employees had not endangered safety and that it was perfectly reasonable to re-employ them on the platforms.<br><br>
A habit exists in the North sea of putting on an oil worker's papers the letters "NRB"—not required back. When that happens, employees are not allowed back on to a platform. It is not the same as walking up to an office door or a factory gate; those who do not want the workers back provide the transport. That is an effective form of blacklisting. The circumstances applying on North sea platforms are peculiar. We must ensure that the provisions in the schedule, welcome as they are—and they are even more welcome with the amendments that the Government have accepted—clearly apply to those who work on North sea platforms and especially to those who may decide to remove themselves from a dangerous place of work. One of the practical problems for people working on a platform is that if it becomes a dangerous place of work, the methods of getting away from it are limited.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
Every encouragement must be given to people who work offshore to enable them to assert their right to draw
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
attention to dangerous situations and to ensure that they can do so without endangering their long-term employment. That must apply especially given that the blacklisting, "not required back" approach has been a dominant feature of industrial relations on North sea platforms. We want it to be made crystal clear in the Bill that offshore installations are covered. The Minister may argue that they are covered, but making it plain in the Bill cannot do any harm and may do a lot of good.<br><br>
We also want clarification in the Bill that the rules will apply to home workers. There has long been dispute between officials, trade unions, employers, employees and people concerned about the circumstances and health and safety of employees about the precise status of home workers in relation to health and safety and their employment legislation. For good or ill, the Health and Safety Executive tends to leave matters concerning home workers' premises to local authority environmental health officers. We are not sure that it is correct in interpreting the law in that way.<br><br>
We believe that, for the purposes of health and safety, home workers should be regarded as employees and that the onus for ensuring a safe place of work, safe machinery and safe materials should be on the contractor or employer. Many home workers in the traditional home work trades—for example, the rag trade—are badly paid, badly informed and ripped off by those who employ them or contract out to them. Some live in peculiar circumstances and have a peculiar and intimate relationship with those who contract work out to them. Some work at home, but the home is owned by the company which provides the home work. They may work with machinery which is supplied by the company supplying the work and may also depend on materials, some of which could be dangerous, supplied by the employer or the person buying their services.<br><br>
There could be circumstances involving bad employers—although not all employers of home workers are bad. The law in all matters, not just in employment, addresses itself to the bad. There is a law against murder because some people need to be caught even though most people are not murderers. When we consider employment law, we must address the problem of the bad employer. I know of people in the rag trade who have set up as home workers and who have been supplied with sewing equipment that the employer knew to be dodgy and unreliable. The law on health and safety is unclear regarding the position of a home worker who sews, knits or makes buttonholes using dodgy equipment supplied by his or her employer or the buyer of his or her services, and is harmed when that equipment goes wrong. The law should be clarified to benefit the home worker. The employer or the buyer of services should have to accept the liabilities and duties of an employer.<br><br>
A new type of home working is developing—high technology home working. Home workers use computers and are, I understand, involved in directory inquiries for British Telecom and Mercury. In a world of changing employment practices, if people would rather work at home than go to their employers' place of work, we should not stand in their way. But we must be careful that that process does not result in a diminution of our already unsatisfactory health and safety record. If, in the process of getting people off his premises and into their own, an employer loses interest in the safety of equipment,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
materials and working practices, dangerous practices may develop.<br><br>
If we are properly to encourage new forms of work that suit people, we should ensure that they are no more dangerous than the old forms of work. For example, new electronic equipment could cause repetitive stress syndrome over a long period, having a deleterious effect on those using it. The chances of that being detected and addressed would be reduced if the work were done from home because home workers would be spread around an area and not situated in one place of work where the incidents would be concentrated and noticed more quickly.<br><br>
There are many arguments for making employers accept health and safety liability for home workers.<br><br>
Conservative Members may be dubious about that concept and view it as another attempt to interfere with employers. But I think that part-time and contract work, some of which is done by home workers, might be encouraged, rather than discouraged, if everyone knew that the Health and Safety Executive, other organisations and, ultimately, the Government and employers would still be responsible for the health and safety of those working at home.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept the merits of making it plain in law that offshore installations as well as home workers are covered by the schedule. That would be a helpful, useful, healthy and safe development.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has referred several times this morning to the Piper Alpha incident, in which 167 people lost their lives. That incident is important to the pattern of development of health and safety in this country, as shown by the statistics provided by the Health and Safety Executive. The incident would have been equally important had one person died, but 167 lives were lost, possibly unnecessarily.<br><br>
Offshore employment, which was included in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Bill of 1992, is not specifically included in this Bill. We hope that the Minister will accept the need for the amendment so that there is no ambiguity. The Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Bill began its passage in another place where my old friend and colleague Baroness Turner of Camden was the Opposition spokesperson. That Bill came to the House of Commons just before the general election. I presume that the Government do not intend to stand on their heads quite so rapidly and will, therefore, be prepared to confirm that offshore workers are protected in the schedule.<br><br>
There is no logic in excluding such workers from the legislation. Considering what happens in the North sea and in Liverpool bay, the drilling industry and the mineral exploitation industry are inevitably dangerous and the need to incorporate those workers is absolute. I speak as the only member of the Committee who has had the benefit of running a drilling rig, albeit on land and albeit a somewhat antiquated device that was used for training purposes.<br><br>
There have been significant changes. When I visited the Morecambe bay gasfield—one of the largest platforms in Britain—the company showed me and another hon. Member some of the recent advances. For the first time,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
women were on the rig. As we left, we passed the duty-free shop, which does not sell alcohol, for good safety reasons. I noticed a collecting jar in which to put money for someone who had had an accident on that rig seven miles off the shore at Blackpool. If fairground workers in Blackpool are covered by the legislation, it is illogical if people who work seven miles offshore on a continental shelf are not included.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
On the more difficult subject of home workers, various groups have made serious attempts to advise and inform home workers of their rights. Indeed—this may not go down well with the Government—attempts have been made to organise those workers. It is an area of employment that must be taken seriously. It is a growth industry in many sectors and it is quite improper to ignore its importance.<br><br>
I shall cite two examples, both from the electronics industry, to show how things have changed. Until about 20 years ago, it was common for major electronics companies to put out to home workers the tin-dipping of components. The companies provided a hot bath, which melted solder and sent fumes into people's faces, and paid workers a piece rate according to how many components they could tin-dip. I am sure that members of the Committee will agree, with our current knowledge of the toxicity of certain chemicals, that that sort of work should not be put out to home workers. We must also ensure that these workers are adequately protected.<br><br>
The electronics industry has rapidly changed. The development of solid state electronics, means that much of that work has been replaced by automation. Home workers, such as the one to whom my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras referred, now work, for example, on word processors. The hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Bottomley) and I sat on another Committee where we listened to advice from Officers of the House about the hazards of radiation from older equipment. My hon. Friend referred to employers in the rag trade who provided home workers with older equipment, which they knew was unsuitable for factory use. The same applies to the use of word processors in modern industries, where there are known risks from radiation and other sources. It seems ludicrous to exclude that group of workers, especially given the change that is taking place in modem industries. I support my hon. Friend. I urge the Minister to find a way of accepting the principles embodied in the amendments and to table an appropriate amendment on Report, unless he is prepared to accept the amendments as they stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I were to accept every amendment, the Committee would be no fun and there would be no surprises. I cannot accept the amendments, but I can accept some of the points raised by the hon. Members for Holborn and St. Pancras and for Ellesmere Port and Neston.<br><br>
I should like to sketch in the background to the subject because it is complicated. I have received some advice, which explains the position. Having read it, I can understand why Opposition Members may be a little confused. One thing is clean at some time soon, a new order must be made to tidy up what is a complex position, but which I am assured does work.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
The amendment aims to extend to offshore installation workers and to home workers the protections given by clause 24 and schedule 5. The clause, and the schedule to which it gives effect, are essentially concerned with employment protection rights in relation, first, to employees who have particular responsibilities for health and safety and, secondly, to employees more generally who, in circumstances of serious and imminent danger, take certain specified types of action. When considering the amendments, it is important to bear in mind the fact that the clause is not about health and safety at work in a general sense. That is dealt with extensively in other legislation.<br><br>
Opposition Members have identified two groups of workers who they have argued should benefit from the protections that the new provisions afford irrespective of their employment status. The first group comprises offshore workers and the second comprises home workers. I propose to deal with those two groups separately, but let me first make it clear that any persons in either group who are employees are already covered by the new provisions.<br><br>
In practice, some offshore installation workers are employees within the meaning of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978, but others are not. Offshore installation workers who are employees will automatically be covered. I am happy to reassure the Committee that the Government's intention is for all offshore installation workers who are not employees to benefit from the protections where, for example, they are safety representatives or designated health and safety workers. That will be done under the new order-making power that paragraph 13 of schedule 6 inserts into the 1978 Act. The power enables the Secretary of State to provide that new sections 22A to 22C, which, like other rights under that Act, generally apply to employees only, shall apply to such other descriptions of persons as may be prescribed. The power is limited to new sections 22A to 22C. It does not apply to the provisions of new section 57A because they concern unfair dismissal and it is axiomatic that an individual who is not an employee cannot be dismissed. I hope that I have made it clear that the amendment is unnecessary because offshore workers will enjoy the protection that they need.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to say that the subject is complex. I am grateful that he acknowledged that he did not completely understand the notes provided to him. I have been through the provisions several times and have struggled to make sense of them. Will the Minister clarify whether any provisions of the Offshore Safety (Protection Against Victimisation) Act 1992 that are not directly incorporated into the Bill will be included in the order that is to be published subsequently?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The protection to be afforded to offshore employees under the Bill is wholly equivalent to—and in some respects, greater than—that provided by the 1992 Act. Because the Act is superseded by those provisions it can be repealed.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman will want to know how the Bill supersedes the 1992 Act. The 1992 Act gives protection only to statutory safety representatives and, in specified circumstances, to all employees.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
The hon. Gentleman rightly paid tribute to the work of Baroness Turner of Camden. We should not fear that any of that work is not incorporated in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly at a loss. First, will a contractor's employee be an employee under the schedule? Secondly, how will self-employed workers on platforms be affected by the rules covering discipline? If they do something that those running the platform do not like, will those self-employed workers have the protection that we have been discussing?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that the hon. Gentleman would not ask that question, because the matter is complicated. I spent a long time with wet towels on my head and will try to explain the position.<br><br>
Clause 24 and schedule 5 amend the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978. That Act protects employees and gives the word "employees" a specific meaning. In the majority of cases it will be evident whether an offshore installation worker is an employee within the meaning of the Act and is therefore covered by it. Subcontractors' employees are clearly covered, but in a small minority of cases the position will not be clear and it will be for the tribunal to decide. The tribunal will take account of a wide range of factors.<br><br>
Paragraph 13 of schedule 6 provides an order-making power to enable my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to make an order affording protection against victimisation to other persons. That power will be used, for example, to cover trainees and, if necessary, people who should similarly be protected against victimisation. For example, should it become apparent that offshore installation workers are being victimised in a way that frustrates the intention of the provision, the order-making power could be used to bring them within the scope of the provison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me finish what I am saying before the Committee loses the thread.<br><br>
Offshore installation workers, like other workers, cannot have their cake and eat it. If they decide that it is generally advantageous to adopt a relationship with a rig operator which gives them self-employed status, they must accept the consequences that follow.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to press that point a little further. Is the Minister saying that an order would not be made until after the need for it had been identfied, or that, in keeping with the spirit of the 1992 Act, an order will be made when the Bill has completed its passage through the House?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that we shall make the order and that the provisions in the primary legislation—the Bill—are sufficiently flexible for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to add to the list of people in the curious category of those for whom it is not clear whether they are employees. Any anxieties that the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston may feel can be alleviated by the order-making power. We shall not have to amend primary legislation if such a group is identified. I gave an example of a group of people who might not be considered to be employees but who should be covered—that is, trainees.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0604">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
I am sure that if the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston thought long and hard, he would be able to come up with other examples. When we introduce the order, the hon. Gentleman will be able to make representations if he believes that the list is not comprehensive.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may help the progress of the Committee if I intervene.<br><br>
Opposition Members, and perhaps some Conservative Members, are slightly perturbed at the idea that the tribunal would decide the matter. We are trying to avoid the tribunal deciding whether someone was of normal fortitude and was acting reasonably. We want to keep people out of the tribunal. I am not sure whether the Minister could be described as a proclaimer—if that is the correct word—of the rights and interests of the self-employed. It has been suggested that Opposition Members are not especially interested in the interests of the self-employed.<br><br>
Everyone's safety on a platform is closely interrelated. A mistake could prejudice the lives of everyone. It would be better if we made it clear that the provisions apply to everyone on the platform. I do not understand the Government's reluctance. Could the regulations mentioned by the Minister extend the cover to everyone working on a platform? Again, we are commenting on the worker.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How can I put this tactfully? The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras is referring to another matter. I agree that the responsibility for safety offshore rests equally on the shoulders of everyone, whether employed or self-employed. The schedule is about employment protection. It is difficult to see how a self-employed person could be included in the scope of provisions that would protect them from unfair dismissal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I know from my limited knowledge of the North sea that people move from being plain, straightforward employees of an operator to being employees of a contractor to having a fee-contract relationship—being self-employed—with the contractor and back again.<br><br>
They are shuffled about. I cannot understand the objections to a contract of work being treated as a contract of employment which would provide people with cover. Will the Minister consider that point? It is crucial that everyone is on the same footing; a self-employed person might decide against doing something that would save himself and others because they might lose their contract by acting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important to focus on what would happen. We are talking about protecting someone from discriminatory action. If a person was self-employed and believed himself to be such, the matter would not arise. The hon. Gentleman was right to refer to the differing patterns of work offshore. A dispute about whether someone was an employee, as defined by the 1978 Act, would be a matter for the tribunal. If the hon. Gentleman feels that this is an issue of concern, I am prepared to spell out in detail the types of test that would be applied to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
determine whether someone was an employee, but I am not sure that that would help the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it would. I do not want the tests to be applied; I want to dispense with the need for such tests. I think that most members of the Committee agree. Because of the movement backwards and forwards between self-employment, working for a subcontractor and working for an operator, it is possible that an incident which occurred during self-employment could mean that a worker could find himself blacklisted when he loses his self-employment and attempts to gain employment with a contractor or a platform operator. All that we want the Minister to do is to consider that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gives the example of somebody with employee status being discriminated against because of action taken on safety grounds at a time when he was self-employed. That issue should be covered by the provisions in the legislation. [<i>Laughter.</i>] It is clearly a new issue, not only to me. I should be happy to consider that example.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister intend to take body language advice?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A certain lack of advice is my principal concern at the moment. I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's comments but, in terms of the amendment and the main thrust of his remarks, I can reassure him that offshore workers will be covered. Self-employed offshore workers are not subject to protection. The hon. Gentleman raised the particular issue of discrimination against them as employees, arising from their previous history, so I shall try to discover whether this is a problem.<br><br>
The amendments also cover home workers. Home workers who are employees are covered by the new provisions. Therefore, people melting noxious substances in their living rooms, to use the example given by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, are covered. Home workers are not a homogenous group. According to the spring 1992 labour force survey, there are about 667,000 home workers in the United Kingdom. That figure does not include those who work away from home but use home as a base. Only a minority of home workers are engaged in manufacturing; most work in the service industries.<br><br>
Home workers have in common the fact that their place of work is their home. The safety of their working environment will be in their own hands to a great extent. Employers of "employed" home workers must ensure their health, safety and welfare, and observe the terms of the health and safety legislation as for their other workers. No distinction is made between them in the legislation. The only exception is the premises of "employed" home workers, because employers have no control over those premises. However, employers are responsible for risks from machinery, equipment or materials that they supply to a home worker, irrespective of whether the individual is an employee within the meaning of the 1974 Act.<br><br>
It is appropriate to remind Opposition Members of the provisions of clause 24 and schedule 5. First, they deal with employment protection rights for health and safety representatives, safety committee members and employees who are designated by their employer to carry
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0605">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
out certain health and safety activities. I hope that it is clear that those provisions are largely irrelevant to home workers who, because they generally work alone, have very little opportunity to represent fellow workers at their workplace. In the event that they were to do so, however, they would be protected, as would offshore installation workers.<br><br>
The clause and schedule deal with the protection of employees who, faced with serious and imminent danger, leave their workplace or take other appropriate steps to protect themselves or others from being dismissed or subjected to any other detriment by their employer. The situation of a home worker with respect to serious and imminent danger is obviously fundamentally different from other workers whose workplace is not their home. Where the place of work is an individual's home, the safety of that environment, in a real sense, will be a matter for the individual home worker and any other adults with whom the home is shared.<br><br>
It is not clear what protections would be afforded to a home worker by the extension which the amendment seeks. If it seeks protection against unfair dismissal for taking certain actions on health and safety ground, it is meaningless as regards home workers who are not employed, because they cannot, by definition, be dismissed. Against whom, other than himself or herself, could such a home worker possibly have redress? Similarly, by whose hands could he or she be subjected to a detriment?<br><br>
That is nonsense, but I welcome the opportunity to put on record that protection which home workers enjoy. I suspect that that was the intention of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras in tabling the amendment. I cannot recommend the Committee to accept it but I hope that, on the basis of the explanations that I have given, the hon. Gentleman will seek leave to withdraw it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister said, especially about the grey, undefined areas relating to offshore workers and his clarification of the position of home workers. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 150 in page 65, line 51 after "date", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"that the employee is informed or becomes aware".</p></blockquote>
If this goes on much longer, I shall be suffering from repetitive stress syndrome. My hon. Friends are welcome to join in and act as a relief party at any time they choose.<br><br>
The amendment was tabled to seek clarification, and possibly to provide it if we are not satisfied with the Minister's response. Under the provisions of the schedule, an incident could occur which led an employer to conclude that an employee had acted, or had failed to act, in a way which made his action, or inaction, unlawful. He could then take disciplinary action against that worker, but not within three months of the act or failure to act to which the employer objected.<br><br>
We believe that under proposed new section 22B(3)(a) that worker could suffer detriment. If he had not been proceeded against by the employer within three months
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
of the incident which caused the trouble, he would, because of that limit, be deprived even of the right to complain about his treatment to an industrial tribunal. Besides trying to tease out the Government's interpretation of the schedule, our amendment would give workers more cover, so that they would have the right to complain to an industrial tribunal within three months of discovering that, following such an incident, the employer had decided to do something that would be detrimental to them.<br><br>
That would cover two eventualities. The most likely is plain happenstance or sod's law—a case in which the employer had not got round to doing anything for three months. The second possibility is less likely but more dangerous and we should legislate against it—namely, deliberate dilatoriness on the part of the employer.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
Under new subsection (3)(a) of new section 22B, as presently drafted, if an incident took place, an employee left his place of work and the employer was dissatisfied with that and wanted to take action against him but delayed that action deliberately until the expiry of the three-month period during which the employee may complain to the tribunal, the employer would have got round the employee protection provisions of the schedule. That would vitiate entirely everything that we are trying to achieve. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response. Does he accept that something is wrong, or have we missed something? In my case, that is always possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras covered several of the points that I intended to raise so I shall not repeat them. It is important for us to consider the ways in which tribunal procedures apply to matters relating to health and safety. There are minor differences in the regulations governing such procedures. The new section contains passages that it would take a highly-qualified classicist to understand, particularly the passage beginning on line 10 of page 66. The drafting raises doubt about the meaning of new subsection (3)(b), so clarification is required.<br><br>
When an employer sacks an employee, it is clear that the detriment begins from the moment that the contract ceases to exist. If the employer imposes a penalty in the form of a suspension and tells the employee not to come in for the next week, it is obvious when the detriment starts. If pay is docked or a fine imposed as a penalty, it is clear when the detriment starts, because the employer has a duty to inform the employee, under other legislation relating to contracts of employment. But what about cases involving merit payments, which are becoming increasingly common? What about productivity payments? What about promotion? What about attendance payments? It might take months for such points to become clear to the employee.<br><br>
The Minister can rightly say that new subsection (3)(b) would give the tribunal scope, but matters would be simplified no end if the primary legislation made clear that the point of becoming aware is critical. The structure of the legislation—which has been discussed in reference to the comments of Mr. Justice Wood and Mr. Justice Browne-Wilkinson—ought to be taken on board in the drafting of the clause. I urge the Minister to clarify the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0606">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
situation so that there is no ambiguity and so that a situation will not occur in which a debate over new subsection (3)(b) would become a relevant issue. New subsection (3)(b) would still be required for the almost unforeseen, but most cases in which there is debate about claims being out of time hinge on that point. The Minister has the power to examine the matter and other regulations, such as regulation 11 in existing HSE guidance notes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston is a man after my own heart—I hope that that comment will not damage him too much—in his criticism of the wording of line 10 on page 66, I discussed the matter at length with those responsible for the drafting. Perhaps I should draw it to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education, given his campaign for the proper use of grammar and the English language. We are in the hands of the draftsmen, but I foresaw that eagle-eyed Committee members—I assure the hon. Member for Wallasey that the pun was not intentional—would notice that wording.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The note that the Minister is being passed probably says, "Sod off".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The note is not in the terms that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras appears to anticipate.<br><br>
I anticipated that eagle-eyed Committee members would notice the wording and might be puzzled by it. I agree that the wording is not only complex, but incomprehensible—except, I am assured, to lawyers.<br><br>
It may be helpful if I give a couple of illustrations of how the provision will operate. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman asked some questions and the illustrations will help to answer them. Suppose that a health and safety representative is systematically denied overtime because his employer wishes to victimise him for the time taken carrying out his health and safety duties. Under new subsection (4), the time limit for a tribunal complaint will run not from the first occasion on which overtime is denied but from the last occasion. Suppose that an employee is denied promotion—perhaps because he left his work area when a fire broke out which he could do nothing to avert. New subsection (4) will mean that the time limit will run from the time the employer does something inconsistent with the act of promoting the employee, such as promoting another candidate or from the expiry of the period within which the employer might reasonably have been expected to make the promotion. The three-month period runs from the last event.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras was concerned about the relationship of the three-month time limit to the event and was aware of the meaning of new subsection (4) because he had advice on the matter from a lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Certainly not. I thought it up myself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman apparently managed to penetrate the grammar of the provision, which is indeed impressive. Ambition should be made of sterner stuff—I was unable to do so without assistance from officials.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised a wider issue, on which I have some sympathy with him. I agree that employees
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
should not be disadvantaged or denied the opportunity to make a complaint to a tribunal simply because they do not become aware for a while after the event that their employer has subjected them to detrimental treatment as described in the schedule. However, I am advised that the Bill provides sufficient flexibility to prevent that, and hope to persuade the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is unnecessary.<br><br>
New section 22B(3) gives an industrial tribunal discretion to extend the standard three-month time limit where it is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable for the employee to make a complaint before then. That is identical to the position for complaints under other aspects of employment protection legislation, and a considerable body of case law has been built up on its interpretation. I have no doubt that members of the Committee—such as the hon. Member for Ellsemere Port and Neston—who have more experience of such matters that I do, will be well aware of that and will be able to confirm that that is the position. I can confidently assure the Committee that no tribunal would consider it reasonably practicable for an employee to make a complaint within three months if the employee did not discover until shortly before the expiry of that period that he or she had been subjected to treatment that might give cause for complaint.<br><br>
I hope that, on that basis, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras will seek to withdraw the amendment. He is looking slightly perplexed, so I suspect that I may not have persuaded him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I fail to understand—perhaps because I do not fully understand the meaning of the wording of lines 10 to 15—is this. If the Government intend tribunals to interpret new subsection (3)(b) to take account of the period until the time at which the person becomes aware of the act, why are they reluctant to incorporate a specific phrase to that effect in the Bill? The work of industrial tribunals is expanding, and that would relieve them of a task—it would be clear that many cases would be incorporated.<br><br>
It seems to me that there is no disagreement on the matter, and our approach would simplify matters no end.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could repeat his proposal. I have said that the existing provisions—which, as the hon. Gentleman will know, are well established, allow for flexibility concerning the time limit where it can be shown that the employee could not reasonably have brought the complaint earlier. There is a body of case law that applies across the board to claims to tribunals. If we insert a new form of wording on which no case law exists, matters could be confused and adverse consequences that the hon. Gentleman and I would not like could result. If the hon. Gentleman were clear about what he proposes, I would, as he knows, lean over backwards to be helpful and am always pleased to consider practical suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All I want the Minister to do is to be more precise in the wording. A significant number of tribunals start with preliminary points of law concerning the tribunal's jurisdiction. Many of those points hinge on things being time barred. The Minister is right: a body of law has been built up. Nevertheless, tribunals are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0607">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
increasingly dominated by highly qualified members of the legal profession and it is not unusual to be up against a barrister in such cases. It would run counter to the spirit of what the Government are trying to achieve if the intention of the primary legislation is not crystal clear. It would unnecessarily take work away from tribunals.</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the hon. Gentleman's proposal would make the credibility of the applicant an issue in deciding whether a claim had been made in time. The applicant would need to give evidence of when he first became aware of the matter in question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, he would have to do that to ask the tribunal to exercise its discretion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the argument that would be deployed in respect of the existing wording, which applies across the board, is that the test of what was reasonably practicable in making a complaint within the time scale would be applied and that a body of case law establishes the meaning of that. However, without making a commitment, I would be happy to give the Committee an undertaking to reconsider the matter. If the hon. Members for Ellesmere Port and Neston and for Holborn and St. Pancras wish to make further representations in the meantime, that would be of value.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Most Members of Parliament do then-level best to maximise the job opportunities of then-constituents. With the possible exception of the Secretary of State for National Heritage I am certain that I represent more lawyers than any other Member of Parliament. I spend most of my time trying to ensure that we do not create work for them.<br><br>
The fact that there is a body of case law should not restrain Parliament from trying to clear up matters. The case law arises only because an original Act of Parliament or regulations were not clear in the first place. The existence of that body of case law is not a good reason for not clarifying the law. After all, there have been several occasions when the Government have been found to have acted unlawfully and on the basis of the argument, "there is some case law, do not do anything about if, the Government have accepted that judgment. We are usually asked to reverse, by law, the judgment of the courts.<br><br>
There is merit in clearly stating in law the justification for an extension of a period and not leaving everything to tribunals. As we shall discover when we deal with a later part of the Bill, the tribunals are overloaded with work at present. However, we may be able to provide matching accessories in this case because the Minister has agreed to reconsider it without commitment. We shall do the same and, after further discussion, we shall decide whether to table an amendment on Report.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 151, in page 66, line 15, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Section 64 of this Act shall not apply where an employee makes a claim for unfair dismissal under section 57A above".</p></blockquote>

Section 64 of the 1978 Act limits the employment protection offered to certain categories of young people and others on the basis that they have not been employed long enough to have the same protection as that offered to long-term employees. For the purposes of the schedule, we hope to set aside that limitation on employment protection and I hope that, on reflection, the Government will accept the amendment. Surely, they do not really believe that young people or those who have been employed on an oil platform or in a steelworks for a short time should not have the same employment protection as that which is available to older people or those who have been employed for a long time. A person who is employed in a dangerous workplace or who is a safety representative should not be faced with the invidious choice of protecting life and limb against that of maintaining their livelihood and legality.<br><br>
It could be argued that the excluded categories under section 64 refer to those who are most at risk. Young people, for example, lacking in experience may be unfamiliar with the circumstances of their workplace. Moreover, short term employees will have less experience than full time ones of the specific place of work and will be less familiar with the hazards and means of escape. Protection measures that apply to older or full time workers should apply to the rest of the employees. The Minister seems puzzled. I may have misunderstood the position, but I await enlightenment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the issue is complicated as we have to refer back to the 1978 Act. I was a little puzzled about why the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras thought that the provision applied an exclusion to young people, as the relevant section is about older workers. I cannot accept the amendment because it is meaningless. Although I am sure that given the hon. Gentleman's remarks, it was not the intention of the amendment, it would disapply the usual qualifying period and upper-age limit for complaints of unfair dismissal, when they are made under new section 22A.<br><br>
I would not usually associate such a radical deregulatory measure with the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that he tempts some of my colleagues. There is a problem, however, for my hon. Friends who might be so tempted. Complaints of unfair dismissal cannot be made under new section 22A, which sets out the right not to be subject to other types of detrimental treatment. Complaints in relation to that right are made under new section 22B. The section under which complaints of unfair dismissal are to be made in the circumstances is new section 57A.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that no qualifying period or upper-age limit will apply to complaints made under either new section 22B or new section 57A. That is what the Bill is intended to provide and the anxieties that have been expressed are covered. However, every cloud has a silver lining and, in the course of trying to understand the hon. Gentleman's intention, we discovered a small drafting error in the Bill. That means that the upper-age limit for complaints of unfair dismissal under new section 57A has not been disapplied as it should have been. I apologise to the Committee for that and for the fact that the notes on clauses were inaccurate in that regard. I am happy to undertake to introduce a Government amendment later in our proceedings to correct the error

in the Bill. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment and accept my thanks for having drawn the error to my attention, however obliquely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The dialogue between me and the Minister must have amounted to one of the most tangential in the history of prodceedings in Committee. It appears that the Bill and the notes on clauses were as off beam as my amendment, but between us we have achieved something I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Fifth schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dobson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for being so helpful over at least some of the amendments. In general we welcome the propositions in the schedule, but one further point requires clarification.<br><br>
Having looked through the schedule and the amendments, and having listened to the Minister's remarks, I am still not clear that all the protections currently proposed for safety reprsentatives and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
employees who have been fingered as safety representatives extend as far as they should to all employees or workers. I should be grateful if the Minister would agree to reconsider the matter to ensure that we have obtained the widest protection not just for safety representatives and their like, but for employees and workers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the hon. Gentleman's point, which has been touched on in speeches by other hon. Members and relates to employees who are victimised for raising health and safety concerns with their employers. I accept that the Bill does not provide specific protection in those circumstances. If an employee fears victimisation for raising such a concern, he would be well advised to take up the matter with the health and safety representative, who would then be able to raise the matter with the employer on the employee's behalf. The employee could retain anonymity. Health and safety representatives are fully protected under the Bill in relation to all their functions and activities.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman points out, I think, that that would be particularly hard on employees in establishments where no official or acknowledged health and safety representative is present. I undertake to give the matter further thought, with a view to tabling a Government amendment at a later stage to protect employees against being dismissed or subjected to any other detriment for bringing a legitimate health and safety concern directly to their employer's attention in a situation in which there is no representative who could do so on their behalf.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Schedule 5, as amended, agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>It being One o'clock</i> THE CHAIRMAN <i>adjourned the Committee without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</i></p>
<p><i>Adjourned till this day at half-past Four o'clock.</i></p>
