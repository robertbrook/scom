</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To avoid a lengthy debate on clause stand part, it may help if I speak generally about the clause now, especially as the amendments cover the meat of the clause. May I confirm to you, Mr. Knox, that I do not wish to pursue amendments Nos. 126 or 122 because those proposals are covered more satisfactorily elsewhere? The Minister, who was looking puzzled but who now looks reassured, should bear that in mind.<br><br>
Clause 25 was introduced in response to European Community criticisms of how the United Kingdom implemented one aspect of the EC equal treatment directive—one of the most important equal opportunity
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
directives introduced by the EC. We have always been strongly in favour of that directive. The notes on clauses explain that clause 25
<br><blockquote><p>"provides individuals with a right to challenge in an industrial tribunal the validity of terms of (a) a collective agreement; (b) a rule made by an employer for application to some or all of his workforce, or to any person seeking to be employed by him; (c) or a rule made by an organisation, authority or body for application to its members or prospective members; which may be applied to them where the terms contravene the principle of equal treatment."</p></blockquote>
The notes on clauses also say that
<br><blockquote><p>"The challenge is to take the form of a request for a declaration that the term is void."</p></blockquote>
As the notes on clauses make clear, clause 25 was drawn up to meet a specific concern expressed by the European Commission over one aspect of United Kingdom remedies for a breach of the principle of equal treatment established in the equal treatment directive. The problem is that there is no clear mechanism to give individuals effective redress under the part of the equal treatment directive referred to in clause 25. It is difficult to avoid saying to the Government, somewhat gleefully, "We told you so." That defect in the United Kingdom's implementation of the directive was clear six and a half years ago, on the introduction of the Sex Discrimination Act 1986.<br><br>
I have before me the <i>Official Report</i> of Standing Committee A on 12 June 1986, when the matter was debated. I was surprised to discover that the Under-Secretary, who is to respond to the debate, was a member of that Standing Committee. However, he had not been a Member of Parliament for long and, so far as I can see, he did not speak on the subject. Clearly, his party Whip, with great foresight, knew that, nearly seven years later, he would respond to Opposition amendments on that matter, so he sat quietly, making sure that, when the time came, he would be able, if not to defend the Government's record—in the circumstances, that would be rather difficult—at least to respond fully.<br><br>
In Standing Committee A on 12 June 1986, the Opposition moved an amendment similar to the provision that the Government are now having to include in the Bill. In 1986 we identified the defect in the Government's implementation of the equal treatment directive and were certain that the Government would have to address the problem in due course. We might regret that it has taken seven long years for anything to happen but we take some satisfaction in having identified the problem in the first place.<br><br>
It was clear in the proceedings of Standing Committee A in 1986 that the Government were guilty of a significant shortcoming in not providing for any mechanism for individuals to obtain redress in the face of a discriminatory term in a collective agreement. The Government compounded their error in 1986 by getting rid of the existing mechanism which would have allowed such redress to be obtained more effectively.<br><br>
The Government, in one of their amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, repealed section 3 of the Equal Pay Act 1970, which allowed the Central Arbitration Committee to take some action in cases of discriminatory terms in collective agreements. By removing the powers of the CAC and the existing mechanism, the Government demonstrated that they were not keen on implementing the directive or on the Equal Pay Act 1970. In repealing that part of the 1970 Act
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0612">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
the Government sent out a very strong signal to employers that they did not really want them to have an incentive to remove the discriminatory terms in collective agreements. That was a sad action for the Government to take.<br><br>
On 12 June 1986, my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, North (Mr. Evans) said in Standing Committee:
<br><blockquote><p>"It seems pointless to make arrangements to improve the structures designed to limit discrimination yet to remove some of the only viable means of enforcement. I hope that the Minister will explain why those means have been removed".—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> 12 June 1986; <i>c.</i>31.]</p></blockquote>
The then Minister did not explain satisfactorily at the time. I shall not ask this Minister the question again, as the Government are doing something to respond to the concerns but my hon. Friend asked a very valid question none the less.<br><br>
I remind the Committee that, during the Report stage of the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, some of my hon. Friends—in particular my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon)—referred to the specific problem that the Government have now had to solve in clause 25 of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have left no mechanism to enforce such agreements. Therefore, there is no authority to which an agreement that may be thought to contain a discriminatory term may be referred, and which can duly declare it void."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend added—soundly in the light of some of our later amendments—
<br><blockquote><p>"It may also prove necessary to amend rather than to void an agreement to avoid uncertainty and confusion for both management and employees."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 22 October 1986; Vol. 102, <i>c.</i>1253.]</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend was right to point that out.<br><br>
It is also worth mentioning that on Report on 22 October 1986, it was clear that not just the official Opposition but other Opposition parties were united in their condemnation of the Government's failure to provide a mechanism for redress in the way that we wanted. Those points were made quite strongly by the then Member for Ryedale, who moved an amendment along those lines, and, indeed, by my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Ms. Richardson), to whom I pay tribute for her long and distinguished record in promoting equal opportunities. The arguments that she made on 22 October 1986 are as valid as ever.<br><br>
Other organisations, such as the TUC and the Equal Opportunities Commission, wrote at length about the Government's failure to provide a mechanism for redress in the 1986 Act, and forecast that the Government would be obliged to change their mind because the EC was unlikely to change its mind and would continue to examine United Kingdom provisions.<br><br>
The Government did not change their mind straight away: it has taken them seven years to bring the clause before the Committee. In 1988, they compounded their error: they repeated the mistake when introducing the northern Ireland (Sex Discrimination) Order 1988. Hon. Members condemned the Government in that debate for not providing proper guarantees against sex discrimination, as provided for in the equal treatment directive and as requested several times by the European Commission and in accordance with the ruling of the European Court.<br><br>
When the Minister moved the order, my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar (Ms. Mowlam) rightly criticized
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
its inadequacies, including the problem identified in the clause. On that occasion, as so often, it was not the Government but their Back-Bench supporters who spilled the beans. The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Mr. Forth), who subsequently became an employment Minister and who is now the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools said:
<br><blockquote><p>"This is one of the most profoundly depressing occasions when one finds one's own Government submitting, it would seem, to the combined forces of the Europeans on the one hand and that dreadful equal opportunities industry on the other."—[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 July 1988; Vol. 136, c. 1026.]</p></blockquote>
—[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear."] Conservative Members' prove my point by their response. They obviously agree with every word that the hon. Gentleman uttered and admit that they have been dragged along unwillingly by the European Commission. I do not know whether the Minister entirely agrees with the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire.<br><br>
I hope that there is a different reaction to the words that I have just read from Conservative members of the Committee. It would be very depressing—to use the words of the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire—if all Conservative members of the Committee agreed with his reactionary and entirely out-of-date views—[<i>Interruption.</i>] There is muttering, but no hon. Member has sought to intervene one way or the other, so my hon. Friends, and I will have to draw our own conclusions.<br><br>
Those comments were revealing. It is also revealing to consider the submission of the Equal Opportunities Commission for Northern Ireland. The EOCNI had proposed that it and the industrial tribunals should be empowered to refer discriminatory provisions of collective agreements to the industrial court for action. The Government ignored that call for an extended remit for the industrial court in the 1988 order, abolishing it instead. So in that order the Government repeated their mistake, deliberately abolishing the mechanism for redress against discriminatory provisions in collective agreement.<br><br>
4.45 pm<br><br>
I refer the Committee to the comments of the Equal Opportunities Commission for Northern Ireland on clause 25:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is the EOCNI's view that clause 25 does not go far enough. Industrial tribunals are to be empowered to declare only that the discriminatory rule or term is void. This means, in effect, that, where the term in question confers a benefit on members of one sex only, rather than modifying the term to ensure that both sexes benefit, the term would be declared void, thus denying both sexes the benefit. This clearly limits the potential of this provision from securing real improvements."</p></blockquote>
The remedy contained in clause 25 is an individual one, and amendment No. 157 refers specifically to that. The provision fails to take account of the hurdles faced by individuals in bringing claims before industrial tribunals. We have already raised that issue with the Minister but it is especially relevant to the clause and the amendment. I shall refer later to the fact that earlier calls for the Equal Opportunities Commission to have specific powers in the matter have gone unheeded.<br><br>
The Equal Opportunities Commission for Northern Ireland goes on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 25 makes no provision for a collective remedy for those affected by the collective agreements in the same way as the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0613">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
individual complainant. The omission of any 'class action' provision means that the industrial tribunal's declaration will focus on individuals only and not those in the same situation in the same organisation."</p></blockquote>
That is a serious issue and makes the clause far less effective than we would like. It may well be that it makes it far less effective than the European Community would wish. The Government may have done the minimum required but it is just the minimum required, and the weight of opinion is against them.<br><br>
Our amendments are necessary because of the extent of existing discriminatory terms in collective agreements. The TUC has published a helpful guide for its members and member unions entitled "Equality in Action—a TUC Guide to Removing Sex Bias from Collective Agreements". It contains a great deal of good material. It argues that such discrimination can be both direct and indirect. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Direct sex discrimination takes place when a woman is treated less favourably than a man simply because of her sex."</p></blockquote>
It cites the example of a policy
<br><blockquote><p>"not to employ women with children which it not applied to men with children; or refusing to interview any women for heavy work on the assumption that all women are incapable of doing the job."</p></blockquote>
It describes indirect sex discrimination as when
<br><blockquote><p>"an unjustifiable requirement is applied equally to both sexes but has a disproportionately adverse impact on one sex."</p></blockquote>
The TUC cites the examples of
<br><blockquote><p>"applying an unjustifiable age barrier; promoting according to seniority; or making job applicants lift a heavy weight as part of the testing procedure, when this is not necessary for the job—fewer women than men would be able to meet all those requirements".</p></blockquote>
Action must be taken whereby direct and indirect discrimination in collective agreements can be properly raised, not only by individuals, but by groups of affected people. That is an important aspect of our amendment. Regrettably, despite the Equal Pay Act, women earn on average about three quarters of what men earn. In some regions, the ratio is more unfavourable to women than that. There are many reasons why that is so. We believe—as does the TUC—that past discrimination has led to many individual women undertaking work that is below the level of their skills and abilities.<br><br>
The TUC guide cites various examples. Apparently, the results of a recent survey in the manufacturing industry showed
<br><blockquote><p>"that of collective agreements with bonus schemes surveyed, only 50 per cent. included part-time workers"—</p></blockquote>
such work is particularly helpful to women, and that only
<br><blockquote><p>"20 per cent. of agreements for canteen workers and 27 per cent. for cleaners covered part-timers.",</p></blockquote>
although many women are in that category.<br><br>
The TUC booklet describes another case:
<br><blockquote><p>"An example of how discrimination in access to jobs was perpetuated by a collective agreement comes from the Post Office, where, according to practice agreed between the GPO and the old Post Office Workers' Union, postal delivery rounds were allocated on the basis of seniority. Before the Equal Pay Act women postal workers had been on temporary contracts. This changed when the law changed but their seniority was calculated only from the time their jobs had been made permanent rather than from the time when they actually started work for the Post Office. Thus their access to the favoured work was limited unfairly."</p></blockquote>
Many other examples are given.<br><br>
I refer the Committee to another interesting publication which was commissioned by the Equal Opportunities
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
Commission and published under its name in its research series. It is entitled, "Equality Bargaining—Why Not?", and is by Trevor Colling and Linda Dickens, who has been attached to the Warwick university industrial relations unit and has done an enormous amount of work on the details of collective agreements and the ways in which they discriminate against women. She has also produced many positive proposals to tackle the problem in the future.<br><br>
The Equal Opportunities Commission report cites many examples of discriminatory terms that still exist. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In almost any sector of industry we can turn up agreements which embody pay structures with women at the bottom of the structure, in grades solely or predominantly occupied by women, and with men concentrated in higher grades".</p></blockquote>
A previous report by the Equal Opportunities Commission examined various sectors to provide more information about the problem. It found that the examination of payment structures revealed a range of discriminatory terms and provisions. The report states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Incentive pay, plus payments or 'add-ons', form another area of importance, especially within collective agreements covering manual workers … Some collective agreements exclude certain groups of women from bonus schemes … Investigating the relationship between hours and pay showed that collective agreements commonly specify the rates to be paid for overtime or for working unsocial hours or for work on shifts, on rest days, etc. Rarely does the setting of these rates directly discriminate as between men and women but in practice the opportunity to earn these premium rates varies considerably between the two sexes and accounts for a lot of the pay differential."</p></blockquote>
The report continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"A group which loses out particularly when it comes to agreements on premium pay is part-time workers."</p></blockquote>
The Government say that they are proud of their record on the increase in part-time jobs. We want to hear about some of the methods by which the Government propose to help those in low-paid part-time jobs in which working conditions are appalling. By strengthening the clause, the Government could do a great deal to help the part-time workers in whom they claim to be interested. I hope that they will take some of those points on board.<br><br>
Amendment No. 157 would make it possible not only for an individual but for a group of workers or a class of people to take action of the kind envisaged under the clause. Many organisations are worried about the fact that the clause refers only to individuals. Given the complexity of the task confronting them, many people may be dissuaded from trying to claim any form of redress. Indeed, the Equal Opportunities Commission stated succinctly in its briefing on clause 25:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is unlikely, therefore, that unassisted individuals will use this provision."</p></blockquote>
The Government must tackle that problem which is highlighted by amendment No. 157 and other amendments. I have lost my notes, Mr. Knox, so I am uncertain which amendments you are grouping with amendment No. 157.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Nos. 158 and 156.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Knox.<br><br>
Amendment No. 158 is important because it would allow not only individuals but organisations to take up cases on an individual's behalf. Earlier, I said that we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0614">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
would be willing to seek leave to withdraw amendment No. 126 and—I had better not get it wrong—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to assist the hon. Lady. I believe that the amendments to which she referred have not been selected. As I understand it, we can only deal with amendments that are listed on the amendment paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for pointing out a fact that I had not appreciated, but as I feel that our other amendments deal with the problems in a more satisfactory way, I shall cry no tears over the non-selection of those amendments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 158 is important because it would allow the Equal Opportunities Commission, unions and organisations whose primary purpose is the eradication of sex discrimination in employment—in legislation and in the work place—an opportunity to bring cases on behalf of individuals. That is vital.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: If an independent union wants to present cases of, say, unfair dismissal on behalf of its members, it tends to present applications to an industrial tribunal. If a large group of its members are involved in the same issue, it will present the applications and apply for a direction from the tribunal chairman that the matters be dealt with together, consolidated and heard at one time. I am not clear why that procedure could not be adopted in this instance and a number of cases heard together with the backing of an independent trade union.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To give force to the terms of the EC directive, it is far more satisfactory to proceed through a strengthened form of the clause to enshrine in law the right of people to challenge collective discriminatory agreements—a right that does not exist at present and is of particular concern to the EC. There would also be a mechanism related to that right, and I would hope that the people who would make decisions about such cases would be well informed on those aspects and would know that they would be required to act within the terms of the EC directive.<br><br>
I do not know whether the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald) has received the briefing that has been sent to many hon. Members by the Equal Opportunities Commission, which feels that the present forms of redress, if they can be described as such, are quite inadequate. The Equal Opportunities Commission for Northern Ireland and organisations such as the National Council of Women of Great Britain, the pay equity campaign and others also believe that the safeguards are not satisfactory.<br><br>
It makes a great deal of sense to amend the Bill to ensure that individuals can be fully assisted by their unions—which does not contradict what the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North said—can approach the Equal Opportunities Commission or another recognised organisation to redress an injustice more directly than has so far been possible. Many of those who have written to us felt that the CAC, as it was then, was capable of making good decisions, but the Government, in their wisdom,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
decided to disallow that decision. However, we shall come to the modification of judgments in debates on later amendments.<br><br>
5 pm<br><br>
It is important for those organisations to be able to assist people. Does the Minister accept the point made by the Equal Opportunities Commission about complexity and the interlocking amendments to various pieces of legislation—the Equal Pay Act 1970, the Sex Discrimination Acts 1975 and 1986 and the Bill? Does he accept that unassisted individuals will find it difficult to make use of the new right provided under clause 25?<br><br>
I mentioned matters that were raised in Standing Committee A in 1986. The terms contained in amendment No. 158 were put forward in 1986 by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, North, who moved an amendment to that effect. The then Minister's response was subsequently disproved by events and by the fact that the Government have had to introduce clause 25. The points that we have raised are important.<br><br>
We regret the fact that the procedure envisaged by the Government is negative; a tribunal may be able to declare the terms void, but it will not necessarily be able to amend the discriminatory term in a way that would benefit all workers. We are worried that all workers covered by a collective agreement could lose because the term was declared to be discriminatory. We want a harmonising upwards—a principle dear to the European Community and often enshrined in EC directives.<br><br>
I could cite many more examples, but in the interests of brevity, I shall stop there, allowing my hon. Friends to comment and the Minister to respond. Although amendment No. 157 is important, the points raised in amendment No. 158 could be conceded by the Government without putting themselves in difficulty. It would allow the Government to respond positively to the many representations that have been received.<br><br>
I have referred several times to how much consultation there has been on the matter, but we could appropriately ask now whether the Minister or his ministerial colleagues have had discussions with the Equal Opportunities Commissions or others about it and, if not, whether they propose to do so. Many organisations have complained to us that the period of consultation on the Bill was short. One reason for that deficiency was that we all thought that the Bill would appear in the early months of 1993—a fact that seems to have been leaked to the newspapers—and not introduced in the autumn.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady confirm that she does not believe everything that she reads in the newspapers? She should not believe reports based on comments that have no foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that I am often highly sceptical about what I read in the newspapers—especially some newspapers. Most industrial correspondents had the impression that the Bill would be introduced in January; then suddenly they heard that it would be introduced earlier. The story to which I referred was probably accurate; the issue had more to do with what the Government wanted to fill up the time with between then

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
and the Christmas recess than with concentrating on other issues.<br><br>
Such a process curtailed what was a necessary period for consultation. We regret that considerably, and we hope that the Minister will put some of the deficiencies right. If he will not accept the amendment, will he at least consult those organisations that are worried about the matter and fully support our amendments?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hutton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 25, the Government purport to bring domestic law into line with the terms of the equal treatment directive, following several cases that appeared before the European Court of Justice. As my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East made clear, the amendments would ensure that we complied with the letter as well as the spirit of the equal treatment directive. We are dealing yet again with an example of the Government doing what they consider to be the least that can be done to comply with the European Court of Justice.<br><br>
The Government are not taking the opportunity—as we would prefer them to do—to embrace the idea of the equal treatment directive and the protection that it provides to women in the workplace. They should bring into domestic law a progressive and purposeful change that would embrace fully the spirit and letter of the directive.<br><br>
Opposition Members have several reservations about the clause. It is common ground between us and Conservative Members that it represents a welcome step forward, but our argument is that it does not go far enough. I shall cite several illustrations to support what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East. Under new subsection (4A), the remedy in a successful application is a declaration by the tribunal that the particular discriminatory clause in the collective agreement is void. I wonder whether that is an effective remedy for an applicant with regard to the equal treatment directive.<br><br>
There is an analogy between the new section and section 1(1) of the Equal Pay Act 1970. For members of the Committee who are not familiar with that Act, it is worth pointing out that that provision creates the concept of an equality clause. The effect of such a clause being implied in a contract of employment would be to extend to a woman the benefit of any term that applies to a man under a discriminatory contract of employment. The Bill will not do that; it simply declares that that discriminatory part of the collective agreement is to be void. Under the Bill, the collective agreement will take effect. The result of a successful application would be that that term of the contract was made void and would not be part of the contract. It would be vacuous on that point.<br><br>
The Committee has the opportunity to make clause 25 slightly different so that it complies with the spirit and letter of the equal treatment directive. We must ensure that a discriminatory term that applies uniquely to a man can be extended for the benefit of a woman if she succeeds in a case before an industrial tribunal. Many organisations have argued for that in their representations to members of the Committee. The amendment is reasonable. It is not excessive or burdensome. The terms have, after all, been negotiated in a collective agreement and the employer has, by definition, accepted them. We are not creating new terms and conditions of employment. The terms
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
have already been negotiated by an employer. The benefit should be extended to a woman applicant. That is perfectly reasonable. Section 1 of the Equal Pay Act 1970 is an appropriate analogy to make in that context.<br><br>
There are further illustrations of how the clause may not comply with the terms of the equal treatment directive. One fundamental weakness of clause 25—towards which one amendment is directed—concerns its enforcement. The clause permits an application to an industrial tribunal to be made only by a particular litigant. It does not permit any other agency or organisation to invoke its provisions. One amendment seeks to permit further applications to be made by the Equal Opportunities Commission and by independent trade unions.<br><br>
There is a compelling case for the amendment. I hope that the Government will respond positively to it. The objective of the clause is to strike out discrimination in negotiated collective agreements. Therefore there is a case for some strategic enforcement capability to apply to clause 25. Why is it that when an issue has an industrial relations dimension the clause permits an individual employee to apply for an industrial tribunal hearing? The issue goes wider than that. There is a case for a strategic enforcement agency. We have strategic enforcement. The Equal Opportunities Commission has a strategic role in developing and enhancing equal opportunities in the workplace. Why are we unable to extend the strategic enforcement role of the Equal Opportunities Commission in order to give effect to the decision of the European Court of Justice?<br><br>
In one sense, it is an unfair burden to stipulate that only the individual employee can take the initiative and bring a case to an industrial tribunal. In many cases, the issues raised by such a case are likely to have general application. The issue could be industry-wide. A particular discriminatory clause might apply to everyone employed in the engineering industry. I wonder, therefore, whether it is appropriate to place the burden of litigation on an individual.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My intervention concerns an earlier point, when I asked for clarification from the hon. Member for Gateshead, East. As the hon. Gentleman knows, at the moment all sorts of cases come before the courts and the tribunals in which the party to the case is supported and backed financially and morally by an organisation, such as insurance companies and trade unions. All sorts of organisations are involved. In a case in which that remedy is available—a breach of the section and a complaint to the industrial tribunal—why is it necessary to make the trade union a party to the action? Why can it not simply support the worker in bringing his complaint? If the employee refused to allow his name to be used in the action, one would not be able to use him, anyway. If he were willing to go ahead, why not back him in the usual way and have consolidated action?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hutton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made some interesting points. The point about supporting applications to an industrial tribunal is important. Parliament has already given to the Equal Opportunities Commission the power to take a broad, strategic overview. There is a case for giving the Equal Opportunities Commission such a special power in the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0616">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
Bill, in addition to giving rights to an individual applicant to present a complaint to a tribunal. I am not arguing that an individual should not have the opportunity to bring such a complaint—in some cases that would be appropriate. However, there may be cases in which a wider power to enforce that obligation might also be appropriate. The two are not mutually exclusive. The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North related his argument to class actions. If he will be patient, I shall speak about that, because when he intervened in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East, he slightly misconstrued the point that she was making.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
I return to the main substance of my argument. In dealing with the issues raised by clause 25, there is a case for that wider strategic enforcement—not to supplant or replace the right of an individual litigant to present a complaint to an industrial tribunal but to help people who may be reluctant to come forward. I am sure that the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North has come across clients who are extremely reluctant to put their necks on the line and perhaps antagonise an employer, as many applications would. It might be better to take the pressure off an applicant and give responsibility for that wider strategic enforcement to an organisation such as the Equal Opportunities Commission, which has a statutory responsibility and is charged by Parliament with promoting equality in the work force.<br><br>
The other fundamental flaw in clause 25 is that it does not seem to recognise that collective agreements are negotiated between trade unions and employers. In that context, there may be a legitimate case for saying that trade unions involved in negotiating collective agreements should also have the right to raise issues of discrimination before an industrial tribunal. The collective agreement has legal significance only to the extent that it is implied in individual contracts of employment. On that level, there is a clear case for saying that individual employees should have the right to present a complaint to a tribunal. I do not dispute that, but if one looks at the industrial relations context of collective bargaining and the role of trade unions in that process, it seems strange to exclude those parties from the right to petition an industrial tribunal under clause 25.<br><br>
As for class actions, the hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North is right to say that the present procedures that apply when a person brings an application to an industrial tribunal allow for consolidated action. That has been used in several famous cases. It is also implicit in those cases that hundreds of individuals are required to present their originating applications to industrial tribunals. For lawyers, that is good news: it will be three cherries on the fruit machine for them. But Parliament is not in business to provide an endless cycle of juicy and plump litigation for lawyers. The hon. Member for Hertfordshire, North may have a different view on that—or he may not—but he will agree that the advantage of class actions is to simplify what would otherwise be hundreds of individual actions. Class actions are common in the United States, which has a similar common-law jurisdiction to ours. Those actions would be consolidated, so that only one application to an industrial tribunal was needed to identify the group of employees who should be entitled
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
to the benefit of the discriminatory term at the stroke of a pen.<br><br>
At one level, that is what happens in a consolidated action. Even with a claim by hundreds of individuals, the industrial tribunal and the office of the regional industrial tribunals would have to deal with hundreds of separate originating applications, which would result in a substantial administrative burden. We also hear the righteous indignation of Conservative Members about administrative burdens, and the need to cut through bureaucracy and red tape. Class actions would provide a simplified, direct method whereby hundreds of individuals who have a legitimate interest in a particular dispute could have that issue resolved by a court—an industrial tribunal—in a simplified, streamlined fashion. I should have expected Conservative Members to be in favour of streamlining administration. That is one benefit of class action.<br><br>
We have several reservations about clause 25. One is that the clause does not go far enough. We could describe it as one more missed opportunity in a Bill that is full of missed opportunities. Many of the clauses are designed to bring domestic law into line with European law. The clause is an example of such an attempt and to that extent we welcome it.<br><br>
There is an advance implicit in the clause, but it does not go far enough. It does not embrace the letter and the spirit of the equal treatment directive. In the not-too-distant future we may be back in Committee debating more Government amendments to existing law because they did not get it right on the first occasion. There are many examples of previous failed attempts to bring domestic law into line with European obligations. The clause is a further example of that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whenever there is a conversion, however limited, we should be grateful for it—so in an equally limited way I congratulate the Government on admitting for the second time in a Bill that equal treatment and sex discrimination issues are sufficiently important to be the subject of legislation. If we examine how that is being done, however, my welcome for their conversion will become even more limited.<br><br>
Excluding the Northern Ireland legislation, for which there was a special reason—the troubles in that Province—the last time that the Government attempted to make any advance on equal treatment was in the Sex Discrimination Act 1986, which brought us into line with European law on equal pay for work of equal value. That process was similar to the one in which we are now engaged. We signed the equal treatment directive and implemented it in a technical and grudging way, giving potential rights on paper. The Commission found that those rights could not be exercised realistically, and women in the work force found it difficult to exercise them. Now we are dealing with another attempted amendment to bring us more into line with the principles behind the equal treatment directive.<br><br>
At least we have an admission from the Government that they believe that sex discrimination is a bad thing. That is a good start, as we can all agree on that. We must now consider how, through legislation, we can communicate to employers that we consider sex discrimination is a bad thing, and take steps to eradicate it from a labour structure that is riddled with it. There are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0617">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
bad traditions dating back before the turn of the century whereby women are extremely badly treated.<br><br>
Women have traditionally predominated in certain professions, such as teaching. Before the second world war and even afterwards it was expected that if a woman teacher got married, she would resign her job. We have come some way from that but we still have a long way to go.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead referred to the discrimination, direct and indirect, that can still be found. It is a massive problem. My hon. Friend mentioned direct forms of discrimination in recruiting women into jobs. Certain requirements may be stipulated even though they are not necessary to perform the job. Indirect forms of discrimination may be more difficult to identify. As a result of the Sex Discrimination Act 1986 and the Equal Pay Act 1970, there is a legal framework that recognises direct and indirect discrimination.<br><br>
I do not allege a massive conspiracy by managers and employers systematically and deliberately to discriminate against women. Some discrimination is deliberate, some unthinking, and some almost custom and practice. The structure of the British work force is characterised by women being what I called in an earlier speech guest workers, expected to come into the work force when the economy needs them and disappear in times of high unemployment, when male jobs are thought to be more important.<br><br>
In the last few years we have been in the middle of a fundamental change in the structure of the work force. There has been not only an increase in part-time work in relation to full-time work but a fracturing of work itself, far more part-time hours, different kinds of contracting, and a move away from the idea of full-time jobs for life to much more flexible methods of employment. In that period, 90 per cent. of the jobs created have gone to women, and the overwhelming majority of them have been part-time.<br><br>
On average, employment rights and pay in part-time work are less, as are conditions such as entitlement to sick pay, holidays and employment rights such as protection from unfair dismissal, which we mentioned. Part-time work pay and conditions are second class in many cases. Women are overwhelmingly gathered in for such jobs, and that is a disturbing example of structural discrimination in the labour market. There is also persistent and massive discrimination in collective agreements that it is difficult to begin to counter.<br><br>
The clause suggests that an adequate remedy for such persistent and difficult discrimination is for an individual woman working part-time or full-time on low pay, possibly not represented by a trade union, who becomes aware that her conditions of work are—whether directly or indirectly—discriminatory and is sufficiently annoyed to go to an industrial tribunal to prove it, in an action that will benefit her only after she has gone through all the problems of bringing it.<br><br>
Those problems are considerable, and they increase the more vulnerable the woman's position. They may involve difficulties with not only her employer but male colleagues who may feel threatened by a woman seeking access to conditions of employment that she has been denied. Since the enactment of sex discrimination legislation, trade unions have had considerable experience of its workings
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
in practice. The clause will not improve the situation, but make it worse. The legislation is extremely complex—there is the Equal Pay Act 1970, Sex Discrimination Act 1975, and Sex Discrimination Act 1986 and their collision or otherwise with EC directives and now the Bill.<br><br>
As our experience in attempting to bring equal pay for equal work cases before the courts during the past few years since 1986 has proved, we do not have a simple, easy-to-use system by which to challenge sex discrimination. Instead, we have a complex, interlocking structure of legislation, which, grudgingly, offers rights to individuals and puts the maximum pressure on an individual in the workplace not to take action. The success of an action is limited because it is so difficult to prove sex discrimination. It may be necessary to take a case through the industrial tribunal system and on to Europe before it can be proved, and even then the decision cannot be applied to others in the same situation. We are asking women—many of whom work part part time in low-paid jobs—to undertake a daunting road to assert their legal rights.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
The amendment would help the provisions of clause 25 to work effectively and to fit in with other legislation. First, it would permit class actions so that individual cases could be used to reach agreements for all women. Secondly, other organisations, such as the Equal Opportunities Commission or trade unions, would be able to bring cases on behalf of individuals. Such cases, if proved, could then be applied collectively.<br><br>
On that basis, we could make progress and improve the chances of women of not being subjected to sex discrimination. Even with a simple and effective law that operates easily and cheaply, we face considerable problems due to the different rights of full-time and part-time workers and women's pension rights. For example, because of the work pattern of women, which involves taking time out to have a family, they often do not accrue sufficient contributions to satisfy pension requirements which have, historically, been worked out over 40 years. That is another example of the institutionalised discrimination faced by women. Furthermore, women's basic pay is often lower than that of men. Overtime and extra payments may be available to women, but they cannot take advantage of them because of family responsibilities. Such examples contribute to the fact that, after 20 years of legislation designed to end sex discrimination and to promote equal pay, women still earn, on average, the shameful figure of only 75 per cent. of men's wages. That is without mentioning the shameful lack of representation of women in the higher echelons of our work force. That deprives the country and the economy of the contribution that women could make higher up the career ladder. We seem to provide work in a way that disadvantages women.<br><br>
There have been many studies of the gross lack of women in the higher echelons of various careers. The most recent one that I can recall stated that only 3 per cent. of people in higher-grade jobs in the City were women. That figure is fairly typical after 20 years of struggle. Of the judiciary and the higher echelons of the civil service, 4 per cent. are women. In the House of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0618">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
Commons, a magnificent 10 per cent. are women. It is to be hoped that there will be more women in future. Discrimination in all its facets is still with us. We welcome clause 25, but we think that it conforms to the Bill's pattern of granting rights in a complex way that is hard to apply. It will be difficult for individuals to exercise those rights. These and other amendments aim to expand the effectiveness of the principle that was conceded by the Government when they decided to include the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is yet another example of what has resulted from the long-running dispute between the Government and the European Commission over the applicability of the equality directive. It is a provision that the Government would have preferred not to have included in the Bill, which is why, in introducing it, they have adopted a minimalist approach. We welcome the provision as far as it goes, but it needs to go much further to be effective.<br><br>
The meaning of article 4b of the directive is abundantly clear to me and I cannot understand why it was not abundantly clear to the Government from the beginning. It provided that
<br><blockquote><p>"all necessary measures to ensure that … provisions contrary to the principle of equal treatment which are included in the collective agreements, individual contracts of employment, internal rules of undertakings or in rules governing the independent occupations and professions shall be, or may be declared, null and void or may be amended."</p></blockquote>
That is abundantly clear to me, but the Government have argued that where collective agreements are legally binding they are covered anyway, and when not, they would not have any legal effect and so do not count—an altogether strange interpretation of the directive. Nevertheless, legal actions and proceedings were brought against Britain, and they continued for some time. Instead of responding to European overtures, the Government made things worse by repealing section 3 of the Equal Pay Act 1970. They took away from the Central Arbitration Committee the power to amend collective agreements. Baroness Turner's words at that time were apposite. She said that
<br><blockquote><p>"unenforceable terms of collective agreements are unenforceable if they are sexually discriminatory."</p></blockquote>
At the same time, the equal opportunities review stated that Britian had an "Alice-in-Wonderland" law in this respect. I think that that is a fair description of the Government's efforts to implement sex discimination legislation.<br><br>
We have moved on since then, however. As a result of pressure from Europe and from British organisations, the Government finally decided to respond and gave some women the right to go to a tribunal. That ensured the enforceability of collective agreements by tribunals.<br><br>
In relation to equal opportunities, I wonder how long we must wait for the Government to change their views on maternity leave. They were articulated by the Minister only last week when he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that employers will not break their contracts with employees, whether or not they are on maternity leave, but employees already have means of redress through the civil courts if that happens."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 12 January 1993; c. 328.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister was referring to amendment No. 101 to clause 20. It seems to me that the logic which was applied
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
by Europe, which forced the Government to accept the relevance of industrial tribunals for cases of sex discrimination, should be applied to that clause. I hope that, on Report, the Government will recognise that it is only a matter of time before that same logic applies to maternity leave, and that they will agree to alter their view on that subject.<br><br>
We are discussing sex discrimination and there are many discriminatory clauses in collective agreements. If women are forced always to seek redress individually because the amendment is not accepted and collective representation is not possible, women will be inhibited, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle) has proved, from using the system successfully and the tribunal system is likely to overheat.<br><br>
There are examples of other discriminatory clauses in collective agreements that are relevant to our discussion. Up to 40 per cent. of complaints of sex bias to the Equal Opportunities Commission concerned unfavourable terms and conditions. We must allow women collective rights to bring cases.<br><br>
One example concerns the job evaluation scheme for ancillary workers in the national health service. In 1990, the NHS unions—the Transport and General Workers Union, the GMB, the Confederation of Health Service Employees and the National Union of Public Employees—launched a campaign of legal action to change the job evaluation scheme for ancillary grades because they had good grounds for believing that the scheme discriminated against women. That is not surprising because it was drawn up during the 1960s, long before the present level of awareness of sex discrimination and the Equal Pay Act 1970. It was difficult to persuade employers, through negotiation, of the need to change the scheme and only after thousands of cases had been lodged with industrial tribunals was pressure brought to bear to design a non-discriminatory job evaluation scheme. There are approximately 180,000 ancillary workers in the NHS, of which about 80 per cent. are women. Not only were employers reluctant to change the scheme, but the law failed to allow the scheme to be challenged collectively. The tribunal system could have been clogged by women wanting to change the scheme, despite having pursued their cases individually.<br><br>
A similar example occurred in the car industry. The TGWU has, rightly, organised an industry-wide campaign for equal-value claims in the motor manufacturing industry. At Vauxhall Motors in Luton, 130 sewing machinists have lodged claims for equal value and 250 equal-value claims were lodged against Jaguar Cars, but unfortunately the cases have been lost. Those women and the TGWU were right to try to remove discriminatory clauses from unilateral terms and conditions and from collective agreements.<br><br>
If we want the law to be effective in removing discriminatory terms, as required by the European Community directive and as the Government state they wish to do in the Bill, it is sensible to allow collective representation, and the amendment provides for that. It is important to ensure non-discrimination against women and, for practical reasons, to ensure that the tribunal system is not clogged. I hope that the Government will think again and agree to the amendment.</span></p>

<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we always have interesting debates. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith) should not get too carried away. The debate may have been interesting but that does not mean that I agree with much that has been said.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East reminded me of my attendance in Committee on 16 June 1986. She is right that I did not say much. Bearing in mind that I entered the House of Commons on 13 May 1986, I considered myself to be on a slight learning curve. There was an occasion when the Government Whip told me that I could have the afternoon off—I thought that I had done something wrong. I did not realise that pairing took place on Committees.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East mentioned the hon. Member for Barking. I recognise the contribution that the hon. Member for Barking has made, and I am sure that we all wish her well. She is unwell and in hospital. I hope that the hon. lady makes a speedy return to the House of Commons.<br><br>
We do not accept that we are required to make the changes sought by the Community on this issue. We are doing so to be helpful, as ever, and in an attempt to clarify the law.<br><br>
Clause 25 allows an individual complainant to make a complaint to an industrial tribunal only if the term or rule which he is challenging is, or may be, a threat to him personally. That requirement of personal interest is consistent with the enforcement of employment rights generally.<br><br>
The Opposition are trying, with the amendments, to open up the scope for challenge to collective agreements to others who do not have that personal interest. In the case of amendment No. 156, it would extend to an independent trade union, some of whose members may be affected by the agreement. In the case of amendment No. 158, it would extend to trade unions, the Equal Opportunities Commission and other organisations interested in equal opportunities.<br><br>
In the Government's view, it is unacceptable in principle and practice for an individual who has no personal interest in the application of a discriminatory term to mount a challenge to it. By the same token, it is unacceptable for those bodies to mount that challenge. In this instance, however, it is not only unacceptable but unnecessary, for reasons which I shall outline.<br><br>
The Government's objections of principle are that the United Kingdom's system of justice is based on individual access to the law to rectify an individual grievance. The procedure sought by these amendments would undermine that important principle.<br><br>
As a matter of practicality, challenge which does not depend on personal interest is a dangerous and inappropriate tool for doing justice in such cases. An individual's right to redress for discrimination depends on the actual treatment meted out to him, the employer's reasons for that treatment and the circumstances in which it took place. How are these matters to be proved without reference to real situations?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a minute.<br><br>
There is nothing to prevent an individual from seeking the support of his or her union in mounting a challenge to a term, the legality of which he or she doubts, or of seeking the assistance of the Equal Opportunities Commission. That happens all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To some extent, the Minister salvaged the issue just after I asked him to give way. I was going to make a pedantic remark because it annoys women, when sex discrimination—which affects mainly women—is being discussed, to hear the words "him" and "his" used the whole time. That makes us even more invisible and really rankles.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am amazed at the hon. Member for Wallasey. If she wants equal opportunities, that is how it must be—it has to be equal for men as well as for women. It may rankle the hon. Lady but I think that it is important. I am sorry to be in the majority on the Committee, as a man. The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde looks surprised but that is a fairly obvious statement. Equal opportunities are important irrespective of sex, and I am surprised that the hon. Member for Wallasey appears sexist in her intervention. I am sure that she did not mean to be.<br><br>
Most importantly, however, the amendments are simply unnecessary. The new procedure introduced by clause 25 would mean that if the applicant were successful, the tribunal would declare the relevant term void—not just unenforceable between the applicant and the employer but void for all persons, for all purposes and for all times. These amendments could not achieve more and their introduction would only serve to make the procedure more cumbersome.<br><br>
The Opposition's case seems to be that there may be circumstances in which it would be unreasonable to expect the individual, who has a personal interest in challenging the term, to take action personally. I cannot accept that. If their concern is to protect the individual from victimisation, section 4 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 already does that. If their concern is that the burden of bringing a case would be too great, I would remind them that this is an action in a tribunal where employees regularly take action for sex and race discrimination. If their concern is the complexality of it, I have said that an individual would be entitled to call upon the support of his union or to seek the assistance of the Equal Opportunities Commission or other bodies which may wish to appear at the tribunal.<br><br>
In the circumstances, I ask the hon. Member for Gateshead, East to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome one thing that the Minister said: his kind words about my hon. Friend the Member for Barking. I did not agree with much else. He referred to his attendance at the Standing Committee in 1986. When I mentioned that earlier, it was partly in the hope that the Minister, who was sitting quietly in that Committee, was silently agreeing with the arguments of my hon. Friends the Members for St. Helens, North and for Barking. Unfortunately, that was not the case.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, I was agreeing with the arguments that were made very admirably, as I now recall, by my right hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang) who is now Secretary of State for Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that the Minister would welcome many detailed questions about what was said in that Committee and perhaps you, Mr. Knox, would not, either. Perhaps we shall return to some of the arguments at that time because they are surprisingly relevant to some of our arguments today. In 1986, the Government said that the changes were not necessary. They were wrong then and they are wrong now.<br><br>
We believe that it is important to go beyond the individual case and to include others who are likely to be affected by what is decided in the tribunals. I could not follow the Minister's reasoning on that issue. He seemed to be saying that the decision had to be related to an individual, otherwise it would not refer to real situations. Our amendment would cover a group of people affected by a real situation of discrimination.<br><br>
I am disappointed with the Minister's attitude to the possibility of the Equal Opportunities Commission, independent trade unions and other organisations taking up cases on behalf of individuals. Our views have been reinforced by the views of those bodies which feel that the amendment's provisions would be more satisfactory than the provisions in the clause. I do not have a great deal of experience in this area, but when the EOC and a large number of unions, pressure groups and lobbyists, which have done a great deal of work on the subject, are all singing the same tune, I am inclined to listen. I am puzzled that the Minister should dismiss the amendment with just a few words.<br><br>
I am sorry to mention consultations again, but the Minister ignored the question as to whether he had discussed with those interested bodies their concerns, which are set out clearly in the briefing material sent to all members of the Committee. The Minister talked about "complexity". At one point, he used the word "complexality", which I had not heard of. It must mean extra-super-mega-complex. We do not believe that the Minister has addressed the problem properly.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will feel able to say more on this issue, and to take up any of the other matters raised by my hon. Friends during the debate. I do not wish to press amendment No. 157 to a vote because part of its argument is taken up later, but I feel that the substance of amendment No. 158, which allows the Equal Opportunities Commission and others to take up cases, is important. Therefore, I wish to press amendment No. 158 to a Division. One of the practical ways in which individuals have been able to benefit from, European directives is that the Equal Opportunities Commission has been able to take up cases on their behalf. To give the clause substance and teeth, why is it not possible for the Equal Opportunities Commission and the trade unions, which have done much work on such issues and which have done a great deal in practice to eradicate discriminatory terms in collective agreements, to take up cases on behalf of groups? I urge the Government to have a rethink or, at the very least, to embark on serious consultations with those organisations, something which they do not, so far, seem to have done.<br><br>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 161, in page 41, line 43, after "tribunal", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"shall declare what amendments need to be made so as to remove discrimination between men and women in the term or rule, and if that is not practicable, the tribunal".</p></blockquote>
I can be brief because, to a certain extent, the aims of the amendment have been discussed by me, my hon. Friends and the Minister—briefly—during discussions on the clause and the preceding amendment.<br><br>
We believe that the amendment is important. If the Minister is unwilling to change the clause to reflect the aims of the amendment, I think that we shall be anxious to press the amendment to a Division.<br><br>
The amendment makes an insertion in line 43 to allow the tribunal to declare what amendments need to be made so as to remove discrimination between men and women in the term or rule. In speaking to the preceding amendment and in discussing the clause as a whole, many
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0621">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
of my hon. Friends referred to their frustration that, in the clause, the tribunal would be able to declare the discriminatory term void but would have no authority to vary the conditions of the term or rule in such a way as to allow both men and women to benefit from what it previously allowed. That is an important point, and we question whether the clause is in the spirit of the EC directive. The enforcement procedure is entirely negative. It could mean men losing out rather than men and women positively gaining from any declaration that the term or rule declares to be void.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
We have been advised that the industrial tribunal which, under United Kingdom law, has no power to amend the agreement, may have such a power under EC law. Has the Minister examined that specific possibility? In the case of Nimz <i>v.</i> Freier und Hamsestadt, Hamburg, which concerns equal pay, the European Court held that where there was indirect discrimination in a provision of a collective agreement, the national court was required to disapply that provision without requesting or awaiting its prior removal by collective negotiation or any other procedure, and to apply to members of the group that was disadvantaged by that discrimination the same arrangements that were applied to other employees, arrangements which, failing the correct application of article 119 of the EC treaty in national law, remained the only valid system of reference.<br><br>
It would be interesting to know what information the Minister has received about that matter. That European Court judgment seems to imply that the employees affected by the discriminatory rule or term could have it changed to their benefit. That would be an important improvement which, were it to apply to Britain, would allow a positive outcome for someone taking a complaint to an industrial tribunal about a discriminatory term or rule.<br><br>
My hon. Friends were right to point out in their contributions to the debate that the clause does not provide much incentive for individuals to take up cases. Apart from the complexity argument, which the Minister did not accept, and the points made about unassisted individuals being unlikely to make use of the clause, there is the possibility that the term or rule will be declared void. That would not necessarily mean a positive change to that term or rule which would benefit all the employees affected in that particular workplace or even beyond.<br><br>
The clause, therefore, does not seem to correspond to the spirit of the EC directive. My understanding is that the EC directive aims to remove discrimination in collective agreements to benefit people who are affected by such agreements. The Government do not seem to want to get to grips with that aspect of the directive.<br><br>
I hope that, even if the Government are not prepared to accept the amendment, they will tell us how they envisage the discriminatory term or rule being changed in a positive way and not simply being declared void. Our decision on whether to press the amendment to a vote or whether to put further proposals at a later stage will depend on the Minister's response.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East. The amendment would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
strengthen the remedy available to women who work within an agreement that contains a proven element of sex discrimination. In discussing previous amendments, we said that the fact that there is no collective approach and that individuals have to bring their own cases puts pressure on individuals and provides a disincentive if they consider taking action. The remedy proposed could significantly increase that disincentive. For example, if a collective agreement contains an overtime payment, which can be proved to be discriminatory, or a grade of job, to which particular requirements are attached, which effectively exclude women from reaching that grade and earning a higher salary—many such provisions still exist in collective agreements for reasons that I explained earlier a woman faces the prospect of having to go through a complex, convoluted process, which could put her under considerable stress and strain. The final outcome, if it were to void a particular section of the agreement, might lead to substantial deterioration of conditions for her male colleagues.<br><br>
When I was pressing for equal pay for work of equal value in the health service, some pay differentials, which resulted from discriminatory agreements that had survived over the years, implied lower payment of between 50 per cent. and 80 per cent.<br><br>
Significant pay implications are involved in proving discrimination. A woman may be faced with taking her employer through the industrial tribunal system, and as the case grinds its way through the extremely slow procedures she may have to work for two years or more with colleagues who are not best pleased that, if she wins her case, part of their collective agreement, which has substantially benefited them in the past, may be voided so as to deny them access to extra payments or other significant and beneficial items in their contracts on which they have come to rely. That is a significant disincentive to women to bring cases.<br><br>
If, as a legislature, we have said that sex discrimination is a bad thing and should be eradicated, why do we set up a system, such as the one that is proposed, which makes it so difficult to progress towards that eradication? Part of amendment No. 161 deals with the implied extension of section 6 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which has never worked very well because there is no enforcement machinery and no incentive for employers to renegotiate discriminatory terms because that costs them money. The small extension that the Government have made to seek to remedy the problem is to allow an industrial tribunal to void a term that has been proved to be discriminatory. But that is only half of the process. It is logical to make void part of an agreement that has been proved to be discriminatory.<br><br>
An industrial tribunal should have the power to suggest and require that the parties renegotiate the agreement to the benefit of both sexes, rather than lowering the terms and conditions for everyone. If the Government were serious about eradicating sex discrimination, they would employ that tactic, as the European directive assumed that they would.<br><br>
If I were a conspiracy theorist. I might think that some of the more neanderthal Conservative Members, given their hostile view of collective agreements, which was apparent in earlier discussions, about union rights, wanted to destabilise them, in the hope that such agreements would crash to the ground. If I were more
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0622">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
charitable, I might think that perhaps they had not considered the problems for collective agreements that would be caused by merely voiding a decision rather than by implementing a more creative amendment process.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we establish that we are dealing with what is in a collective agreement, not what is in the contract of employment. The Equal Pay Act 1970 deals with contract terms by giving the disadvantaged sex the benefit of the more favourable terms. That process is not affected by action against the collective agreement.<br><br>
I am surprised that the hon. Member for Gateshead, East and her party are advocating that a judicial body should have the power to overwrite the results of a freely negotiated agreement.<br><br>
That apart, the amendment would put the tribunal in an impossible and inappropriate position of rewriting the terms on which, possibly, an entire industry operates. It was never envisaged that a tribunal would take on that role, nor would it make any sense. It is the task of the tribunal, as a judicial body, to ascertain the facts and apply the relevant law. If the tribunal finds, on the facts, that a term in an agreement is sex discriminatory, it is for the parties to the agreement to decide how to respond, not the tribunal.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East asked how we are complying with article 4, which requires us to allow for collective agreements to be made void, to be declared void or to be amended. The clause provides for the first two of those. We do not need a third option. The hon. Lady also asked about a court ruling. Her pronunciation was careful. I do not think, however, that I could get it right. To the best of my knowledge, we are in compliance with that ruling. It might be more appropriate if I were to write to the hon. Lady to explain why we are in accord with that ruling. I hope that she will agree to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the Minister's reply but it is not satisfactory. He did not deal with the points made by myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey. He said that he was surprised at what I was advocating. We are trying to ensure that we comply with the letter and spirit of the EC directive. We doubt whether that will happen.<br><br>
The Minister believes that we are not acting contrary to the court ruling. That matter is open for discussion. The Minister said that he would write to me about that. I hope that he will also write to my hon. Friends and, indeed, to all members of the Committee because what he has to say will determine whether we push the matter at a later stage and will affect the deliberations on the Bill in another place.</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it helps the hon. Lady, I shall ensure that the reply that I send her is copied to all members of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister.<br><br>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey that disincentive is piled on disincentive as a result of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
tribunal only being able to declare the matter void. My hon. Friend's example was good: that someone would have to undergo a fairly lengthy procedure to try to obtain redress and that at the end of the day her colleagues might not be too pleased with the outcome.<br><br>
I accept that the bargaining process would mean that the issue had to be considered in the affected workplace. None the less, I think that to allow an industrial tribunal to make a positive recommendation would help women who brought cases to it and would also fall more in line with what is done in other European countries than what the Government have been prepared to do in this part of the Bill.<br><br>
I am sorry that the Minister cannot respond more positively to our comments. Once again, many bodies besides the Opposition are interested in the subject and feel that the tribunal should be given extra power. That was argued for in the House several years ago. The Government have been dragged slowly towards making greater concessions in order to implement the directive properly. There is a danger that they will have to return at a later date and make a provision similar to that which is outlined in the amendment. For all those reasons, I should like to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 41, line 43, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4E) All employees affected by a term or rule found to be discriminatory by an industrial tribunal shall be notified by the tribunal of the decision and shall be entitled to benefit from it.'.".</p></blockquote>
This is an ambitious amendment and the Minister's expression suggests that he is unlikely to accept it. It raises an important matter. How will people who may be affected by a term or rule which is found to be discriminatory and declared to be void be able to learn about that and benefit from it? How does the Minister envisage that process taking place?<br><br>
I hope that the Minister accepts that although it is important for individuals to obtain redress—we feel strongly about that—the purpose of the equal treatment directive is to benefit women at work as a whole. The gain of one individual must be transferred to all those in the same position. We are discussing collecting agreements and we should consider all those who are covered by an agreement or by agreements in which the similarity is sufficient to suggest that the tribunal's decision would affect them.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0623">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
The principle is important and we have included it in a probing amendment to obtain the Government's views. The gains, if any, from a tribunal decision should be applied as widely as possible to remedy injustice and unfairness. We feel strongly about that and hope that the Minister does also.<br><br>
The Minister dodged my question about consultation. Every time he rises to speak, I hope that he will say something about that and the various meetings that he has had with the Equal Opportunities Commission and other organisations, but he always sits down again without answering my question. I am sure that organisations which are anxious for all women to benefit as far as possible would be interested to hear the Minister's views and to have discussions with him about modifications to the Bill, in line with our suggestions. Has the Minister had discussions with the Equal Opportunities Commission on the matters covered by clause 25? If not, has he made arrangements to do so and is he prepared to do so before Third Reading so that the anxieties which they have strongly expressed can be properly aired?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady anticipated my response to the amendment, which is that it is unacceptable because it would impose on industrial tribunals an impossibly heavy burden of administration. They would be required to notify all employees affected by a term or rule which is found to be discriminatory.<br><br>
Many collective agreements affect tens of thousands of workers all over the country. The administrative framework and arrangements which would be needed to fulfil this obligation would be in excess of any possible benefit.<br><br>
Tribunal decisions are already recorded in a register available for inspection to the public. The unions representing affected workers and the Equal Opportunities Commission could use their own resources to disseminate widely the effects of a tribunal's decision to make void a discriminatory term in a collective agreement. The unions would be in a particularly good position to do so.<br><br>
The hon. Lady has argued on numerous occasions for consistency. She should think back to earlier parts of the Bill when the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) argued that we should not require trade unions to send every member, individually, a copy of the new financial statement, unless they were asked to do so. A similar analogy can be drawn between the way in which information from a tribunal can be disseminated and the way in which we came to an agreement as to how that should be done by the trade union.<br><br>
In the circumstances, I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment. I can see that she is ready to pounce on me and ask a question relating to consultation. I certainly do not want to sidestep that issue. Several aspects of the Bill have gone out to fairly extensive consultation, both as far as the general election was concerned and our position since early November when we first published the Bill, since when people have been able to make representations to my hon. Friend the Minister of State and I. If any organisations want to make further representations, I am always prepared to try to accommodate or meet them. I cannot assure the hon. Lady that I shall be able to do that before Third Reading because, at this stage, I have no idea when that might be.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that what the Opposition say now is inconsistent with what we said on earlier provisions in the Bill. There is a clear difference. When my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras spoke about the dissemination of union reports, we were dealing with an amendment of substance to the Bill. In moving this amendment, I explained that its aim was to probe how the Government propose to disseminate the information that results from a tribunal's decision. There is no inconsistency in the way in which we dealt with those two very different issues.<br><br>
The Minister's comments about consultation were surprising. A body such as the Equal Opportunities Commission, which performs a valuable role and is a Government body, can hardly be told that consultation is to be limited to how people voted in the general election. That seemed to be what the Minister implied. He also said that other bodies could make representations and that there might be an outcome to those representations. That was not a satisfactory response. We are talking about the many detailed representations that have been made to us by people whose everyday work is concerned with women's employment issues. Therefore I would once more urge the Minister to embark not just on consultation but on discussions that cover the contents of the Bill. It concerns me that the issue of how the Bill can best help women at work has not been specifically discussed. I do not apologise for returning to that subject.<br><br>
I do not intend to press the amendment to a Division but I hope that the Minister will commit the Government to helping organisations such as the Equal Opportunities Commission and trade unions to publicise the results of tribunal decisions as much as possible, so that those people who are eligible to benefit can start the necessary processes to ensure that, at the end of the day, they derive positive benefit from tribunal conclusions.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 160, in page 41, line 43, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(4E) Where the industrial tribunal declares that a term or rule is discriminatory the respondent shall modify or remove the term or rule within 60 days of receipt of the order and shall so notify the tribunal within 21 days of the action being taken."</p></blockquote>
The amendment refers to the action to be taken by companies and the organisations involved in collective agreements, as a result of a tribunal decision. The amendment states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the industrial tribunal declares that a term or rule is discriminatory the respondent shall modify or remove the term or rule within 60 days of receipt of the order and shall so notify the tribunal within 21 days of the action being taken."</p></blockquote>
We believe that that is important and should like to hear how the Government envisage the procedure once a tribunal has decided that a discriminatory term or rule is void.<br><br>
6.30 pm<br><br>
In drafting the amendment, we thought that the Government might be a little more sympathetic to our amendment which called for the tribunal to be empowered to modify decisions and to change the terms of a collective agreement. That part of this amendment is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0624">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
inappropriate, given the Government's negative response. None the less, we should like to use the amendment to probe what will happen once a tribunal has made a decision and what onus there will be on companies to ensure that they act in accordance with the judgment of the tribunal within a certain time limit. The amendment sets out a time limit.<br><br>
The Equal Opportunities Commission was concerned about the matter. It issued a briefing about the Bill on Second Reading to, I think, all members of the Committee which mentioned its worries about there being no notification by the relevant employer about what changes were envisaged. In the absence of any notification, the Equal Opportunities Commission felt that the tribunal should refer the matter to the commission for further consideration. Has the Minister considered that?<br><br>
Having said that, the amendment is self-explanatory and I look forward to the Minister's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The respondent in proceedings may not be the author of the agreement or rules, one of whose terms has been declared discriminatory on grounds of sex. He may not even have been a party to the agreement. In such circumstances, it would be wholly inappropriate that he should have a duty to rewrite or renegotiate a term for which he has no responsibility. It is sufficient, in the Government's view, to adhere to the simple formula of a declaration that the offending term is void. It will then be for the parties to the agreement to decide what should be done to fill the gap left by the tribunal's declaration. Putting a time limit on a union to negotiate would not necessarily be the best way in which to obtain the best negotiations.<br><br>
The Government also believe that it would not be appropriate for the industrial tribunal to take on the quasi-enforcement role envisaged by the amendment. The tribunal must remain a judicial body charged with the duty of establishing the facts of a particular case and applying the relevant legislation.<br><br>
I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened to what the Minister said and was interested to hear what he outlined as follow-up action resulting from the tribunal's decision. However, I was not entirely reassured. I accept, to a certain extent, what he said about time limits—in certain circumstances, such a time limit could be unhelpful. My hon. Friends have mentioned the lengthy proceedings that will already have been undergone to reach that stage. We do not want months or years to go by without effective follow-up action being taken. That is why we wonder whether there should be a time limit, even if it is not what is laid down in the amendment, or a monitoring process so that effective action is taken to change the agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may be overplaying this point. Once a decision has been declared void, it is not operable and, therefore, would have to be replaced. It would be for the union or the relevant body to negotiate to ensure that an acceptable replacement is found. But, as the hon. Lady said, if a case ran its full course—which could take some time—minds would have turned to considering how to overcome the problem should the tribunal rule the term void. I understand the concern that the hon. Lady
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
expressed, but I hope that it will not be a real problem of serious detrimental consequence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that, as the process is lengthy, the people involved might envisage the outcome of the tribunal's consideration in advance. However, that might be an optimistic view in the case of a company that is not anxious to change a discriminatory term or rule and that will find it inconvenient to do so. It might be inclined to delay the proceedings, even after the tribunal has delivered its judgment.<br><br>
I am not reassured. Perhaps, we need to have the provision applied in practice to see whether our fears are well-grounded or groundless. None the less, it is something that interested organisations will want to monitor and the Opposition will continue to consider. The Government should give it their attention. One of the frustrations, and, sometimes, one of the disincentives, is simply the amount of time involved in obtaining satisfaction when trying to redress such a wrong. We tabled the amendment in that spirit. However, the Minister gave us a small ray of hope that he might consider the point subsequently. Given that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay proceedings as we have dealt with many matters relating to our amendments to clause 25. Before we conclude our discussion, I should like to pay tribute to the unions and other organisations that have been active in trying to rectify discriminatory terms in collective agreements. The TUC's booklet "Equality Bargaining: Why Not?" to which I referred, gives many examples of the negotiations of organisations, including trade unions, to protect part-time workers. They have negotiated pro rata, basic and overtime pay and terms and conditions that are the same as those of full-time staff. They have also negotiated Sunday premium rates for part-time workers and people who work unsocial hours.<br><br>
In one example, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers negotiated Sunday premium rates for part-time workers with companies, including Victor Value, Lewis' Ltd. and GUSCO, and negotiated rates for unsocial premium hours with other companies. That is especially relevant because the Shops Bill will be discussed in the House on Friday. We should commend those negotiations, which resulted in better rates for part-time workers, many of whom are women. I hope that such negotiations will continue whatever shape clause 25 takes as it emerges from these and subsequent discussions.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to consider the additional points which the Equal Opportunities Commission made about clause 25, which were not incorporated into the amendments to the clause and which we have not discussed. The Equal Opportunities Commission is keen that there should be a statutory requirement that all employees who do the same work or broadly similar work as a successful applicant should be entitled to the same reward. That statutory requirement is not in the Bill. Employers should be required to notify the industrial
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0625">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 499</span>
tribunal of other employees, male or female, who are engaged in the same work or broadly similar work and, if so, that the necessary adjustment to their pay has been made. Such follow-up action is important to ensure that the maximum number of people benefit from the clause.<br><br>
The Equal Opportunities Commission also believes that any dispute as to whether an employee, male or female, who is engaged in the same or broadly similar work or in the same employment should be determined at a hearing limited to those issues. The commission is also concerned about the absence of any notification by the respondent that the matter will be dealt with following the court's decision.<br><br>
All those matters are important and should be taken into account when considering clause 25. We are disappointed that the Government would not accept our
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 500</span>
amendments, which were backed by many people outside the House. None the less, we welcome the small advance in the clause. The Minister knows only too well that it is seven years too late and that if the Government had accepted the wisdom of the Opposition's advice in 1986, they would not have had to introduce clause 25 now. I hope that the Minister will learn that lesson and accept the wisdom of our amendments to future clauses.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Clause 25 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p>Further consideration adjourned.—[<i>Mr. Wood.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Adjourned accordingly at eighteen minutes to Seven o'clock till Thursday 21 January at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
