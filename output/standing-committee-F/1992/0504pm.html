	<div class='title'>ACTIVATION OF PART II</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made.</i> No. 142, in page 12, line 45, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Until a decision has been made by the Council of the European Communities to introduce a regulation on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in potatoes, subsection (1) above shall have effect with the substitution for 'expedient' of'in the public interest'.".—[	<i>Mr. Curry.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 143, in page 13, line 4, leave out "Community" and insert "Communities".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider Government amendments Nos. 144 and 146.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments are entirely technical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our debate on the previous amendments remains incomplete. It is within the Committee's power—at your discretion, Mr. Cook—to continue down that route. There is one issue with which Ministers have not dealt, and it should be covered. It is the issue that I raised with the Secretary of State in my intervention. People want to know the answer to that question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My case was simple: if Europe decides, in its wisdom, to change the rules, so be it. We will try to secure a compromise position, if possible, while Ministers try to impose the free market. That is an instruction from Europe. The question is, what would happen if the British Government decided, by way of a unilateral decision, to get rid of the potato marketing scheme, irrespective of what was happening in the rest of Europe? The clause provides for that. I want to know whether the regime that exists in other parts of Europe would be entertained by the British Government. Will the social security system that operates in Holland, which provides a base income for the self-employed potato grower, be considered by Ministers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not arguing that that should apply, because I do not believe that we should take that route. However, if Ministers insist that that route should be taken, we are entitled to know the Government's attitude to the Dutch system of social security top-up payments for self-employed people. I also want to know whether the low interest loan arrangements—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. John Selwyn Cummer)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has nothing to do with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>214</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. The amendment changes the word "Community" to "Communities" and the clause states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"section 53(4) of this Act shall apply as if the references therein to sections of this Act include a reference to this section."</p></blockquote>
We are dealing specifically with Britain's opt-out arrangement, or rather, the arrangement whereby we could go down the free route. That would not apply across the European Community if nation states could retain their current arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know whether the low-interest loans that are available in France would be made available to potato producers in the United Kingdom. Would the intervention stock buying that occurs in a number of other member states occur in the United Kingdom. Are the Government prepared to introduce those arrangements? Will they entertain the idea of other forms of subsidy to the potato industry, like those that are available in other parts of the European Community? Will they consider introducing unilateral measures to control imports of potatoes from other Community countries? I am not stating my position but simply putting it to Ministers that such arrangements exist in other parts of Europe. If we are to remove our scheme unilaterally, we cannot leave British potato producers to compete with potato producers in other parts of Europe who benefit from the schemes that I described in the debate on an earlier amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Could the hon. Member help the Committee by explaining how changing "Community" to "Communities" has a bearing on the issues that he is seeking to air now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 22(2) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Ministers certify that they are of the opinion that is is necessary that the Potato Marketing Scheme should be brought to an end because its continued existence is inconsistent with a regulation of the Council of the European Community, section 53(4) of this Act shall apply as if the references therein to sections of this Act include a reference to this section."</p></blockquote>
Ministers wish to amend that subsection by changing "Community" to "Communities". I am explaining the effect of such an amendment. I know that I am on tight ground, but there is consistency in my arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. The Government amendments would tidy amendments that were made by the Opposition in another place. Surely the Opposition know what the amendments mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook. It might help the Committee if I pointed out that the amendment does not alter the position to which the hon. Member for Workington is referring. Whether subsection (2) reads "Community" or "Communities", the rest of it stands. Surely it is not in order to argure about the rest of the subsection, which is entirely unaffected by whether the word is "Community" or "Communities". We should discuss how the word "Community" or "Communities" changes the original subsection, which used the word "Community". As the part that the hon. Gentleman is discussing is not changed at all, it seems that you, Mr. Cook, were reaching towards a suggestion that the hon. Member was moving beyond the bounds of the amendment tabled in response to the Labour party's amendment in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>215</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not reaching towards anything. It was a simple, plain, bald, naked and unadorned appeal for the hon. Member for Workington to relate the issues that he was airing to the amendment. Whether the amendment alters a clause that has already been amended in the other place is irrelevant. The point is to bring it in order in this Committee. I am asking the hon. Member for Workington to relate his comments to the clause and to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. Perhaps I can clarify the position. I was led to believe by the usual channels that the Secretary of State would not attend our proceedings this afternoon. On that basis, I sat down at 12 minutes to one o'clock to allow the Minister to reply to the debate. If I had not done that, the Minister would not have been able to reply. However, the Secretary of State turned up this afternoon. I was unable to pursue those matters during the debate on a former amendment because I, the Opposition spokesman has been misled. We were clearly told that the Minister would not be here this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook, if it was a point of order. I am sure that you will remember that the hon. Member for Workington appealed to me to come to listen further to what he had to say on this issue. I am here to listen further. I must say that, so far, I am no more enlightened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matters that have been raised are not for the Chair. If the Committee continues in this vein, it will be asking me to rule on whether it will rain next Wednesday. My job is simply to ensure that the rules of procedure are followed properly and that the debate follows the selection list. I ask the hon. Member for Workington to ensure that his contributions stay within that framework.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may help the Committee out of its problem. I wonder whether it would be possible for you, Mr. Cook, to reconsider your ruling from this morning that there will perhaps not even be a short debate on clause stand part. If there might be a short debate on clause stand part—I need intervene only for a couple of minutes—I shall not pursue the amendments further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman. My comments this morning, if accurately recalled, were not that there would not be such a debate but that there might not be one. A member of the Committee approached me prior to this afternoon's sitting, when I said that I was disinclined to allow such a debate, unless a—am I allowed to say this?—bloody good reason were given. I am inclined to think that the offer that has just been made is a bloody good reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis, Mr. Cook, I shall resume my seat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I sincerely hope that the Clerk has taken a careful note of that comment and that it will appear in the next edition of "Erskine May".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>216</span>
	<p>	<i>Amendments made:</i> Number 144, in page 13, line 5, leave out "include" and insert "included".</p>
	<p>Number 145, in page 13, line 7, leave out subsection (3).—[	<i>Mr. Curry</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 13, line 19, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(6) In deciding whether it is necessary or expedient that the potato marketing scheme should be brought to an end arising out any regulation of the Council of the European Community on the common organisation of the market in potatoes or otherwise, the Minister and the Secretaries of State shall have regard to the need for the arrangements which match marketing conditions in Great Britain.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment applies only where the EEC has taken a decision that requires the United Kingdom to adopt a common regime. The proposition behind the amendment is that, if we are to be the subject of such an instrument of instruction from the Community, we should do everything possible to retain as much of the present regime as is acceptable within Community rules. The reality is that any compromise regime in the EC will inevitably retain a form of state aid. I understand that there are varying views about that in the Community on which we may be able to comment, with the benefit of the Minister's experience of discussions of recent months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite my understanding of the line-up in votes and perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong because I have not had the benefit of being present at the negotiations. A group of member countries in the Community is in favour of a free market, another group is in favour of intervention and a third is in favour of a lightweight regime. I understand that the United Kingdom and Luxembourg are in favour of a free market. I believe that the Minister thinks that I am wrong; perhaps he will tell me the correct position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The present position in the European Community is that, in general terms, a group of member states supports the Commission' proposal for a lightweight regime. They range from those that want just enough of a regime so that everyone is on even Stevens—if there is a regime, national measures are no longer possible—to those that would like a little more than that. Some, mainly southern, countries look for a heavyweight regime because they would like to have intervention for potatoes and would especially like to get money from the north into their coffers. Roughly speaking, that is the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of countries are in favour of the first proposition, as is the Commission, and that is what I expect will be put through. This country and Luxembourg do not have a special relationship in that regard although we may have it on other matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the discussions that I have had with people, who are not present, who were party to the negotiations, I was told that the line-up split three ways and that the United Kingdom and Luxembourg were the only countries in the Community that were prepared to accept a system of non-intervention—a free market—but without national measures in support. I understand that other countries that support the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>217</span>
lightweight regime want national measures in support of their positions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I have finished, perhaps the Minister will clarify the position—that will save him from intervening. I stand to be corrected, because it is difficult for us to establish the accuracy of our information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that a qualified majority is required to carry whatever scheme may subsequently be approved. What would be the common position of those countries that comprise that qualified majority? I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I am told that it would probably be that nation states should retain a semblance of national measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also told that it is not only in the Council of Ministers where the argument rages. It also rages in the European Parliament where it is being spearheaded by a number of Conservative Members, although I am sure that some of my hon. Friends in that Parliament are involved. In a number of constituencies represented by Conservative Members of the European Parliament there are large numbers of potato producers. Earlier, I referred to one of them—Mr. Crampton. Mr. Michael Welsh is the Conservative MEP for Lancashire Central. I believe that Mr. Welsh is a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and he pressed an amendment which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"At its request, a Member State may be authorised to grant … the right to establish production quotas for and to levy contributions from potato producers".</p></blockquote>
We are led to believe that, within the European Parliament Conservative group, there is strong support, if not for intervention, for a regime in the Community that provides for the retention of a revised potato marketing scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also understand that in paragraph 2.3 of its report to the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed instruments i.e. support for the establishment of producer organisations"—</p></blockquote>
which is the Commission's original proposal—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and import licences will not suffice to achieve the intended stability of the potato market and a decent income for growers."</p></blockquote>
The report also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission should therefore launch an investigation to identify the national support measures compatible with the aims and principles of the Common Market which can be retained under the new organisation for potatoes."</p></blockquote>
Apart from the Commission, at every stage within the Community—in the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament and its committees, for example, in the agriculture committee and the Economic and Social Committee—a view is developing that national measures must be introduced or maintained to back up whatever lightweight arrangement the Council of Ministers agrees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that the key to this is the relationship between the Commission and the Council of Ministers. The Commission has the right of initiation, while the European Parliament has an advisory role. In other words, the Council may not decide in the absence of Parliament opinion, but the Parliament does not have the same powers as under the Single European Act, under which its ability to amend is much more substantial. As the hon. Gentleman will no doubt recognise, the role of Economic and Social Committee in
	<span class='label label-info column'>218</span>
this is so marginal that I should be most surprised if anyone had read its opinion. But I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for having done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to the committees as being advisory. To me, that means that they are part of the democratic arrangement and process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Economic and Social Committee is not an elected body, so it can hardly be described as part of the democratic process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The agriculture committee certainly comprises members of the Parliament, so what it says on such matters must bear some weight. Plainly, it expresses the concern not only of European Conservative Members of Parliament but of a wider group of Members of the European Parliament and—even if not reflected in this Committee—the views of many Members of the House of Commons who were free to express their opinion on Second Reading of the Bill. It is most curious that none of those who spoke in the House in favour of retaining the scheme or, at least, of a compromise arrangement, have been appointed to serve on this Committee where they could perhaps express their views more openly. Perhaps there was a special kind of selection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 15 April, a series of amendments was put before the European Parliament. Amendment No. 14 related to the right to establish quotas. Amendment No. 2 related to the establishment of a fund to finance storage and the purchase of surpluses. Amendment No. 8 was about the enforcement of rules in production areas where more than two thirds of producers belong to a co-operative. Amendment No. 9 concerned the setting up of a revolving fund to cope with cyclical instabilities in production. Amendment No. 12 related to the right for producer organisations to control volumes and areas under production. Amendment No. 13 was about the right to take regulatory measures to deal with crises in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those amendments were tabled with a view to securing a background arrangement so that European potato producers were not driven into the free market conditions that seem to dominate the views of Ministers—certainly in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Others within the community have taken what I might call a more sane position, as reflected in the amendment. I refer to the Committee of Agricultural Organisations in the European Community and the General Committee for Agricultural Co-operation in the EEC—COPA and COGECA. The Minister may laugh, but they are serious organisations. They represent the views of co-operatives in the wider agricultural community. Their views are repeatedly quoted by processors, producers, those involved in the debate nationwide and the farming press. They said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is the unanimous and unqualified view of all potato producers and their cooperatives of COPA and COGECA throughout the Community that the proposals put forward by the Commission for a potato regime are unworkable and would not meet the objectives of providing regular supplies of good quality potatoes at fair prices for consumers and providing stable and satisfactory returns for producers … In its present form it would have the effect of sweeping away well established regimes for dealing with marketing problems in many Member States"—</p></blockquote>
I referred to those in debates on earlier amendments and the Potato Marketing Board is certainly one of them—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0128">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>219</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"and, in these States where no regime exists, it would fail to address the fundamental problem which currently besets the European potato market … CO PA and COGECA therefore reject the proposal put forward by the Commission and insist that their own 6 point plan be implemented without further delay, together with"—</p></blockquote>
I now come to the amendment—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a facility for the continuance of well established national measures in those Member States who desire them and a greater flexibility in the measures to be taken to stabilise market prices".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, COPA and COGECA are well-known organisations. The hon. Gentleman is clearly familiar with them. Could he cite another area in which he agrees with them? For example, will he say whether he agrees with their views on price fixing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are debating potatoes. I am sure that we shall be able to debate the issues that the Minister raised in European Standing Committee A, perhaps as early as tomorrow morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way a second time so soon. Can he give one consumer organisation that advances the same point of view as him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

COPA and COGECA produced a six-point plan and said that it should be backed up with national measures. The reality is that there is open hostility from those organisations, from Conservative members of the European Parliament and from Conservative Members of the House. I am told that there is division even within the Commission. Someone in the Commission—I am told that it is an official—keeps briefing the press to say, "It is only Mr. Gummer who insists on breaking the potato marketing scheme." That was not the line given to me by Mr. Kummer, the Commission official responsible for potatoes. When I had discussions with him, he felt strongly that the Minister has a lot in his case. I am only pointing to the fact that there is division within the Commission.

Yes, there is division in the industry—among the producers. This morning, the Minister produced some
	<span class='label label-info column'>220</span>
polling data. I had that checked. The figures that he gave were not correct. I am advised that the figure was not 50 per cent., but that 71 per cent. of those polled were in favour of the scheme's retention. Some polling data produced by Anglian Produce was misrepresented, too. It was not that organisation which was responsible for such mispresentation, but the media.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend mentioned the figure of 71 per cent., because that concurs precisely with what was stated in the letter that I received in the lunch-time post from the Cheshire arable committee of the north-west region of the NFU. That committee referred to the figure of 71 per cent. and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In view of this high level of support for a managed market for potatoes in this country, I would ask for your support in retaining the Potato Marketing Scheme."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot embroider further on what my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) said, apart from saying that Ministers have sought to misrepresent the polling data. I understand that 78 per cent. of large processors in the United Kingdom said that they were in favour of the scheme's retention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Processors?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, I meant producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer now to the view expressed by 	<i>Farming News,</i> which reflects well the views of potato producers in the United Kingdom. Under the heading
	<br><blockquote><p>"Potato men lurch from feast to famine",</p></blockquote>
the publication stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When the Government first decided to abolish the PMB's powers to intervene in the market it did so in the expectation it would have wide support from producers."</p></blockquote>
To be honest, when I first looked in to the matter, I, too, had some sympathy with the proposition. It was only when I began to investigate the issue and discuss it with people that I realised that certain aspects of the scheme were crucial to the survival of much of the existing British potato industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in 10 or 15 years' time our potato industry might exist under a different sort of regime. Our objection is that Ministers are taking to their breasts the powers to overturn the scheme and impose on British potato producers a free-market regime within 12 months. They want to do that irrespective of the consequences referred to in the report from Nottingham university, which we shall no doubt deal with later in our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article in 	<i>Farming News</i> went on to state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Moreover, with the EC about to introduce a lightweight potato regime based on the open market in operation in every other member state, it thought it would be difficult, if not impossible, to persuade our European partners to allow us to continue with our present arrangements.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We now know, however, that this is not the case. Senior officials in Brussels have made it perfectly plain they are ready to amend the draft regime to allow us to retain quotas and market intervention. We would, they say, be pushing at an open door."</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that that was not true and that no one in the Commission was willing to consider even a revised arrangement. The right hon. Gentleman argued that the Commission is saying that the potato marketing scheme
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0129">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>221</span>
must go. He said that in whatever form that it was considered—revised or not—it would not meet the criterion that the Commission would want the Council of Ministers to approve, and that it would not meet the terms of such a scheme. The Minister says that it is incompatible and that the Commission also says that it is incompatible. In fact, the Commission does not say that it is incompatible. There is a division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister replies he should clarify the position so that we can refer the matter to Commission officials. Do some Commission officials believe that it is possible to revise the scheme so that it will afford some protection to Britain's potato producers in terms of stability in the market? Will the Minister answer that question? The Government are unreasonable in ruling out the need to retain national measures. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Workington said that he has heard reports, coming from the general direction of the European Commission, that if British Ministers were to seek derogations or concessions to enable the potato marketing scheme to remain in being they would be pushing at an open door. That would be a little out of character because, as we understand it, the Minister has bolted the door. He would look even sillier than usual if he were to push against a door that he had bolted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my hon. Friend for tabling the amendment because, hopefully, it will enable us to press the Minister to go through the list of other member states so that we can find out what they do with their potato industries. The issue was well aired on Second Reading. Soon, people in Britain will be able to say, "The current potato marketing scheme will not cost the taxpayer a penny." We cannot say the same of schemes in other member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to having
	<br><blockquote><p>"regard to the need for the arrangements which match marketing conditions in Great Britain."</p></blockquote>
Evidently, similar or different arangements apply in other member states. In some cases, a great deal of taxpayers' money is spent on supporting the market for potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our free-marketeering Government want to set the market free and flood Britain with cut-price potatoes. Will there be—to use that cliché again—a level playing field? Ther are schemes, funded by taxpayers, across the channel—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>rose—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to sit down. The Minister will be able to go through the whole list, go into the matter in great detail and explain how the special interests of the potato sector in other European countries will be operated, how much will the scheme cost the taxpayer in those countries? Will there really be a level playing field?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall bring the Committee back to the circumstances in which the discussions took place. The Commission proposed to the Council of Ministers that we should have a lightweight potato regime. Such a regime would make notifiable—and largely illegal—the support for potatoes to which Opposition Members have referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>222</span>
If there is no unified regime, those measures do not have to be notified in such detail, and most of them would not be illegal—although some, for particular reasons, have been so declared. The Commission's idea is to have as light a regime as is consonant with achieving that end. Many of the member states that support the Commission are concerned only that a lightweight regime might go too far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Far from being the free market apostle to which the hon. Member for Workington referred, Britain finds itself outclassed by several countries that would prefer not to have a regime at all, but which increasingly recognise that that would mean not a free market, but an unlevel playing field. It would enable other countries to spend taxpayers' money in support of their potato industry, resulting in unfair competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best way to describe the two—rather than three—camps is to say that there are those who would support a lightweight regime, who are joined by those who would prefer to have no regime at all, but recognise that there is no other way of excluding some of the less attractive activities to which the hon. Member for Workington referred. It is likely that those two groups will coalesce to support what the Commission proposes, as long as we all have absolute assurances that such a lightweight regime would not be the precursor to an ever more complex potato system throughout the Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the question in the uncertain immediate future is what is the threshold for the scheme that may be introduced? The Minister will have an interesting discussion in the coming weeks. That scheme may still permit some of the practices that have been described this afternoon and may therefore, be, in the Minister's view, an unacceptable alternative to the present marketing system in this country. At what point would it become a satisfactory replacement? How many of the existing practices of other member states would the Minister accept in the interests of reaching agreement on a scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands what the argument is about. Among those countries that presently have systems of support for potatoes—countries that, as the hon. Member for North Cornwall said, use a variety of mechanisms to support their potato industries—some want a lightweight regime, even though that would make their own present activities illegal, because they want a common system throughout the Community. In their view, the common system should be one under which, in general, there is a free market, but under which countries can have the sort of producer groups that provide for research and marketing just the sort that we envisage in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It would not be helpful if I explained the other side of the argument so that every member of the Committee understands it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some countries take a different view. They want a heavy potato regime that would enable the European Community to establish a complicated system of support for potatoes, similar to the triumphantly successful ones that are already in place for beef, wheat, wine, olive oil
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>223</span>
and other produce. I do not think that any member of the Committee would want us to go down that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a clear choice between having a lightweight regime—which would mean that the very market distortions to which the hon. Gentleman referred would no longer be possible—or a heavyweight regime—which would bring to bear the full panoply of European Community powers on the poor, beknighted potato.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I must finish my explanations so that we do not find ourselves in this difficulty again. I shall be happy to give way when I have done that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is where the battle lies. Among those in favour of a lightweight regime are some who, like ourselves, are absolutely in favour of the Commission's proposals, while others—quite a number of them—are, in the parlance of the hon. Member for Workington, to the right of us on this issue. They would like there to be no regime. They think that if such a regime exists, the market cannot be free and fair. They are worried about a regime because they fear that, at some point, somebody may come up with a good scheme to extend that lightweight regime into something more powerful, more otiose and closer to Mr. Chirac's well-tested beef regime. I have sympathy with their view, but, as we cannot find another way around the system that avoids discriminating against the United Kingdom, I would prefer to accept the Commission's proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An unnamed Commission official in an unstated place at an unspecified time is supposed to have said that, were the British to press the Commission, we could have a Community regime, but with a derogation for the British Potato Marketing Board. No one has ever identified the man, the place or the time. However, let us imagine that that person, that place and that time existed. What did he mean? He meant that if the British were to ask for a system that removed the level playing field and discriminated against the United Kingdom to the benefit of other countries in the Community, those other countries might vote for that system. So would I if I were them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What if the French or, to take a better example, the Danish or Dutch came to us and said, "We would like to have a system that discriminates specifically against our potato industry and that leaves in place any supports that you might like to have in other countries. Would you be prepared to go along with our idea?"? I would reply that, of course, I would vote for it immediately. It would do them down and do us up. I always vote for proposals that favour Britain. However, I do not make proposals that are against the interests of Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such a Commission representative existed, he would be someone with a specific, narrow intellect. He would have caught on to the ineffable truth that, were we to make proposals that were damaging to Britain and encouraging to other countries, those other countries might vote for them. That is true to a certain extent, but it does not affect the particular subject that we are discussing because I am not making a proposal that is contrary to Britain's interests, nor have I done so and nor shall I do so. I am merely supporting the European
	<span class='label label-info column'>224</span>
Commission's proposal, which seems to me the best way to get rid of the very market distortions to which the hon. Member for Workington rightly, painstakingly and at great length has drawn attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must be referring to the well placed Brussels source who was quoted as saying in 	<i>Farming News:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Mr. Gummer apart, no-one really cares whether the directive ever becomes reality".</p></blockquote>
That observation does not surprise me. Can I take up the Minister on his description of the lightweight regime? He said that member states that presently subsidise their potato industries in one way or anther would cheerfully refrain from paying such subsidies once Britain got rid of its potato marketing scheme. That is how it sounded to me. Is the Minister seriously suggesting that countries such as France, Spain, Italy or the Netherlands would stop paying subsidies to their industries in those circumstances? If he is, what grounds are there for such pious hope?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I had better go back to what I said originally. There are two groups of countries, and the countries mentioned by the hon. Member of East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) span those groups. There are some countries—Spain is one of them—which want to stop paying national support to their potato producers by getting the European Community to pay it for them. They want a heavier regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is worth a try.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman says, it is worth a try, but it will not succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other countries, including France, Denmark and Holland, want a system in which there will be no support for potatoes. They believe that they must support their potato industry themselves because others support theirs. If we have a lightweight regime, it is not a question of whether countries will cheerfully stop implementing their own schemes. That will be illegal and they will be unable to do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even the Italians?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's fascination for Europe is one which I never understand. He is in favour of Europe in principle but believes that every member is up to no good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Including the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting that I should be a member of the European Community when the hon. Gentleman considers himself not to be a member. He is wearing a European tie and spouting anti-European sentiments. He evidently believes that there is no way in which we can trust these foreigners. I know that view—it obviously starts somewhere over the border between England and Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as the hon. Member for East Lothian is able, he has raised a serious point. He suggested that the present system is an unlevel playing field and that if it were levelled, others would not obey the rules. If that view is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>225</span>
accepted, we cannot have a European Community. Our purpose is to have one regime throughout Europe—if that is what the Commission manages to get support for—that will not cost the taxpayer additional money but will ensure that countries will not support their potato producers. Therefore, we shall have a level playing field in which to sell our potatoes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington says that I have a curious view and that I want to allow every other scheme to remain in place while getting rid of the Potato Marketing Board. That is not true. I want a system under which no country tries unfairly to promote its own potatoes against other countries' so that we can all use the single market to sell our products. I want that because I think that British potatoes are good potatoes, that our producers and processors are of a high quality, and that we could beat the lot of them. We could do that only if we operated on a fair and equal basis, so I want to get rid of other countries' support for their potato organisations as well as of our system, which disadvantages our potato producers in competing in the single market. That is the difference in opinion between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are again arguing wide of the amendment. I am not objecting to that and you, Mr. Cook, are permitting it, but perhaps we could return to the territory of not needing a clause stand part debate. The Minister is dealing specifically with the issue that I wanted to deal with before lunch, but could not. Before I go into that, I want to press the minister on the question of the heavy regime. We know the voting power of members of the Community. I understand that Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and Ireland are in favour of a heavy regime. The Minister may shake his head, but can he put names behind the votes, so that we understand what we are dealing with? The clause is in part about unilateral powers, and we must understand to what extent Ministers might need such powers if they do not get their way in Europe. We shall understand whether Ministers will get their way in Europe by knowing who is in favour of the heavy regime and wants the substantial powers of intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ireland has three votes, Spain eight, Italy 10, Portugal five and Greece five. That makes a total of 31 votes, which could block the regime that the Minister favours. Will the Minister clarify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that the hon. Gentleman is in difficulty because he has not attended the relevant meetings. I have been to those meetings for seven years. It is complicated—I do not underestimate that—and, therefore, it is not a matter which is as simply solved as he suggests. Whatever the proposals may be, they are put forward in the context of a series of decisions that have to be made, many of which are within the remit of price fixing. If I were looking for something in that context, I would intimate to the Commission, as I often do, that I do not like something else. If the Commission wants my support, it must be helpful on the matters that I care about. Therefore, the number of people who are on one side or the other now is not material.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington and the Committee must obtain from me the best assessment that I can give of what the result will be. It is that the Commission is in a strong position because it alone can propose. To have a
	<span class='label label-info column'>226</span>
proposal that is different from that of the Commission, there must be unanimity. I am clear that there will not be a heavy regime because there will be no unanimity and the Commission will not make such a proposal. There are several countries that in no circumstances and on no terms would accept a heavy regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of those countries that want a heavy regime would prefer a light regime to no regime if that were the only proposal on offer. Most of those countries that would prefer no regime will recognise in the end that they cannot have both no regime and a level playing field. They must decide which they prefer. In almost every case—I say almost because I have learnt not to say every—they will plump for a lightweight regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall find ourselves with the package of a lightweight regime, which will be supported by enough countries for it to be accepted. That is the best assessment of what is the overwhelming likelihood. It could be that, for some reason which I have not detected, what I think is extremely likely to occur does not occur, but that is the best advice I can give to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the way in which the Minister is setting out the scene, with all his experience, yet more evidence that it is extremely difficult to forecast what will happen? Is not it the case that ample evidence suggests that it would be much easier for the Committee and the House if we were able to make the advances proposed in the Bill conditional on the outcome of the right hon. Gentleman's discussions on the regime? All the hypotheses—the right hon. Gentleman put forward another in his last few words—could become a certainty. We appear to be deliberately driving into a fog.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not applying himself to the issue. I am describing, for the benefit of hon. Members, where I think we shall be. I am doing so with care because I should not like to overstate what I believe to be so much a likelihood as to be almost a certainty. It would be unfair to the Committee if I went further and I am leaning against that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to consider what would happen if we were faced with no lightweight regime and the current situation. The problem is that the regimes in other countries give their potato producers an advantage in the market because they are about paying people money so that they can sell potatoes more cheaply, obtain better marketing and buy better storage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Uniquely, the British potato marketing scheme does something different. Our scheme makes it less possible for people to take advantage of the market because it aims to benefit the producer by restraining his ability to compete. Our scheme is of a different nature from those of our competitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the market. Opposition Members have been somewhat odd in their attitude to processors. I refer to processors because they are the customers who buy the product. If they recognise that there is no level playing field, that some countries support the potato market in such a way as to increase availability and lower the price of potatoes, but that one country supports the market in such a way as to decrease availability and raise the price
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>227</span>
of potatoes, where are they most likely to invest? Are they more likely to invest in the country that increases availability and decreases the price or in the one country that decreases availability and increases the price of potatoes? They will invest in the country that offers them greater opportunities. That decision affects British jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not driving into a mist. I am merely saying that, without the very likely European regime, if it became clear that Britain was shooting itself in the foot by continuing the current potato marketing regime, no sensible Government would stand aside and say, "Let the Dutch take it over. Let the French subsidise their industry into defeating ours." In those circumstances, we would take measures, which would have to be approved by affirmative resolution, to replace the current potato marketing scheme with those elements that benefit us in the quest for export and import substitution and remove those elements that disadvantage us. My only interest is the interest of the British potato producer. I am totally uninterested in any dogmatic or doctrinal view, as I always have been. Therefore, I hope that we will continue as I have proposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman is so interested in producers, how can he respond to the worries of the arable committee of the Cheshire National Farmers Union, which expressly said, in the context of its speciality market, that the livelihood of its members will be jeopardised if the Bill, as it stands, becomes law and the Minister decides to end the potato marketing scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because that committee is wrong. The reason why it is wrong is so clear that I fail to understand why the Opposition are pressing the point. If I proposed that Britain should restrict the production of carrots, while every other country in the single market was promoting it, would the hon. Gentleman think that it would be sensible for the British Government to maintain that position? If we had no single market, that position would not arise. In the protected markets that we once had, I was a strong supporter of the concept of a marketing scheme, contrary to those who hold doctrinal views against it. The hon. Gentleman cannot attack me on a doctrinal basis; I am entirely pragmatic about the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a single market, it is barmy to run a protectionist regime when one has no protection. For that reason, I believe that those who promote the continuation of a scheme that was set up when Britain was a national market when Britain is now part of a single market that stretches as far as Sicily are wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman missed out on the one difference between early potatoes and the main ware crop and the processed potatoes. The early potatoes start with an advantage, as does the ware crop, because of the extra cost of about £35 a tonne to carry potatoes into this country. Such protection means that we are able to compete more effectively without difficulty and certainly without any help from the Potato Marketing Board. With
	<span class='label label-info column'>228</span>
the sort of production where the value-weight ratio for importations is much extended, however, it is clear that we are not doing so well. That is why so much imported material is coming into this country, I want to make sure that all of it is replaced by home produced material. It is equally important that we should become the source of those potatoes that we currently import.

Last year, 80,000 tonnes of potatoes were moved through the McDonald's chain in this country alone. I am pleased that the majority of those potatoes came from British producers but I want those producers to supply all the stock. I also want much more of their production to be exported to the rest of the single market.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman has a greater understanding of higher mathematics and economics than most of us, but would he please listen? He did not answer the question when I put it to him directly, so I shall try again. Will he explain to me how he maintains that people are likely to expand their manufacturing investment in future in a market that restricts the very product that they want, when, within the same single market, they can get potatoes without restriction? It stands to reason that people in the business will buy potatoes from the country where they have no worries, where they do not have to negotiate for extra acreage and where they can get all the potatoes that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, irrespective of the European Community, if we found that British potato producers were disadvantaged by the terms of the single market linking in which the Potato Marketing Board, it would be our duty to dismantle the Potato Marketing Board. I do not say that we would do that next year, the year after, the day that the Bill was passed, or 25, 250 or 2,050 days later. I am simply saying that it would be ridiculous to

	<span class='label label-info column'>229</span>
pass the Bill and not to give the Ministry the opportunity to save the British potato industry if that were within its powers. To exclude that possibility would be a mistake.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the potato marketing scheme restricts production. Is not it equally fair to say that it encourages production? There are producers in the Room today who, despite their large undertakings, have never been offered contracts by the processors. If the processors want the product, they can commission it by contract in the market. They are entitled to do that at present. As I understand it, nothing in the scheme prevents them from doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister wants an overhang in the market of excess potatoes, which deflate the price of potatoes generally. Does he not accept that potato processors can now buy what they want in the United Kingdom, if they contract for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All I want is a position in which British potato producers and processors win and do not lose. I want us to be able to compete, the hon. Gentleman advances the preposterous concept that a processor is more likely to expand in a country where he has to negotiate with a joint consultative board that is weighted against him, in order to get the necessary potato acreage, instead of going to a country where he merely signs a contract and gets the potatoes that he needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make it easier for the right hon. Gentleman. If we are importing the raw potato equivalent of 560,000 tonnes per annum, is it not true that the processors could decide at any time that they wanted those potatoes to be produced in the United Kingdom, and that they could ask the producers to plant to meet that level of demand? What is stopping them from doing that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first thing is that the processors would have to go through the system, otherwise they would be acting illegally and committing a criminal offence. The hon. Gentleman said that the system does not work like that and that they get whatever they want. If that is so, why have a system at all? If the PMB delivers everything that a market would deliver for itself, we are asking for the retention of a system that does not work. The only case for the PMB is put forward by its promoters—to restrict production so that the price is kept at a level which makes it uncompetitive with countries in the remainder of the single market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not look for a plot when there is none. I know that that is very difficult for him—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Jean Corston 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bristol, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. Let me deal first with the hon. Gentleman's sedentary grumbles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is simple. If the PMB creates a circumstance in which British potato producers are not
	<span class='label label-info column'>230</span>
competitive with Dutch producers, jobs will be lost to Holland. If it does not do that, there is no reason in a single market for its existence. The hon. Gentleman can have it one way or the other. If we have the PMB and it is effective, it must make Britain less competitive in processed potatoes. If we do not have the PMB, I contend that the British potato processing industry will be able to compete effectively because it is an efficient industry. I would not want a unilateral change unless I was convinced that it was necessary to make that change because, as a Conservative, I make no changes unless they are proved to be necessary. The argument is whether it is sensible to have the PMB when it is unilateral and not universal. Is it possible to have a unilateral system of restriction of production in one part of a 12-member single market? I do not believe that any economist would say that it is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that only those who want to restrict the market support the PMB. That was the ambit of his definition, and no other reasons were given. How does he explain the fact that I have been contacted by Mrs. Joan Burnett, vice-chairman of the East Riding branch of the National Farmers Union and a member of her local borough council. She states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I meet a wide cross-section of opinion. So far I have only met one grower who does not support the PMB. The main point I would make is that it is proven in providing a safe and wholesome supply of goods at a sensible price, and"—</p></blockquote>
this is important—
	<br><blockquote><p>"providing confidence for growers to invest and plan ahead. As it is self-financing I simply cannot understand the Minister's attitude, but suspect the pressure is coming from the Potato Processors Association."</p></blockquote>
When the Minister addressed the Committee during an earlier sitting, he referred to the processors as the consumers of potatoes. I consume potatoes in ways which do not require the intervention of the potato processors on most days of the week, as do most members of the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mrs. Burnett continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Please bear in mind that 70% of the potatoes consumed in UK are fresh … and it is our staple diet."</p></blockquote>
How does the Minister include Mrs. Burnett in the very restricted definition which he gave, which I suggest was misleading?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I referred to the processors as customers simply because the hon. Member for Workington started talking about them as though they were a group of wicked people with no connection with the industry other than a nefarious one. They are customers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should listen to himself. He certainly gave that impression. The majority of customers for potatoes buy fresh potatoes. However, that part of the market is in decline. The processing of potatoes into a finished product accounts for the minority but growing part of the market. Not only is that part of the market increasing but, more importantly, there is every sign that it will continue to increase for a long time to come because of our current habits of buying more and more processed food instead of producing it and cooking it at home. I do not approve of such habits, and I am sure that that is the position of many of the homes that the Committee represents. However, such is the generality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>231</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can my hon. Friend confirm that the potato processing industry employs 16,000—as many as those who are involved in growing potatoes if not more? Will he also confirm that the growth in the imports of processed potato products has cost the balance of payments a substantial amount of money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It has cost about £120 million. He is also right about the number of people who are employed in the industry. That number is comparable to the number of people employed in the production industry. However, I put it to members of the Committee that the Government have in mind the interests of both those sections of employees. Ware potatoes, to which Mrs. Burnett referred, are protected by the cost of transport across the channel. Therefore, she need not have the worries that she has on ware potatoes. She does not mention any worries that she might have about processed potatoes but she ought to have worries about them. The problem with processed potatoes is precisely the British problem in so many other areas. We have a high proportion of markets that are declining and a small proportion of markets that are increasing. That is precisely how our industry has missed out in many ways in the past. I am concerned that the industry, for which I have an important responsibility, does not miss out now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is because I am on Mrs. Burnett's side and because I want to protect her, her family and her future, that I want to ensure that we secure the market for us and do not lose it to others. That is my job. Were I Minister for potatoes in Holland, I would argue for Britain to keep the PMB come what may because that would put me in a strong position. I am fighting for this measure only because I am the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for Britain. I want British producers to benefit from the growing market in processing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to say that the processing industry is the growing market. There is no argument about that. Producers must respond to that challenge. However, the Minister gives the impression that the producers and the Potato Marketing Board are somehow set in stone, that they are like crops that have gone to root and are unprepared to move. Is not it the case that the marketing scheme has been flexible and that the home-grown share of the market is increasing? Has not the home-grown share of the processed potato market recovered from its low point in 1985, with 64 per cent., to 74 per cent. in 1992? Our producers can respond to the challenge within the framework set out by the potato marketing scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must refer to the framework. If it is such as to design a system that ensures that the British producer is not as competitive as he would be in the free market, it must be true that no processor could possibly commit 100 per cent. of his production to a resource that was based on a price fixed not by the market and in competition but by the Potato Marketing Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the processors look to the long term, they must decide to compete in a marketplace where the raw material is an important part of the end price—sometimes as much as 40 per cent. Therefore, they must site a development where supplies are limited only by a processor's ability to sign contracts with farmers. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>232</span>
processor must not be in a position or a framework—as the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping) said—which is designed to ensure that the price is uncompetitive. The only reason for having the Potato Marketing Board is to restrict production so that the price is not what it would be on the free market. If the board exists for any other reason, it is not achieving anything for the producer. Therefore, it must exist for that purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are asking a fundamental question. I say that to the hon. Gentleman simply because it is important to the future of the industry. Can he name a product other than milk for which he would want a system that would restrict its production, while in the rest of Europe production was free of restriction. Can he name a single product for which he would recommend that system, as a marketing base, to enable Britain to win its place in a single market from Scotland to Sicily?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Devizes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening with great care to what the Minister and the Opposition have been saying. Has the Minister seen a letter that I received from PAS (Grantham) Limited, which is a processor. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Despite our location in the heart of Lincolnshire, England's largest potato growing county, we have been forced to import potatoes from the Continent this year in order to meet our customers' increasingly stringent requirements. Despite the apparent huge surplus of potatoes in Britain this year … we have been unable to find sufficient supplies of the right quality, size and variety for our wide range of products."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The reason for this ludicrous situation is the Potato Marketing Scheme".</p></blockquote>
Has my right hon. Friend the Minister seen the letter dated 29 April 1993 from Everest Frozen Foods, which manufactures frozen potato chips? It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Over the years we believe that this scheme has exported acreage and jobs to the continent. We believe that the abolition of this scheme would be in the interest of the whole potato industry in the U.K.".</p></blockquote>
That is what processors say who can get their raw material from abroad but who would prefer to get it here. They cannot get it here because of the scheme. Does not that make total lies of the statements made by Opposition Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must ask those who take the opposite view why they propose a scheme for the potato that is not proposed for any other product. They do so because it would be better to restrict and restrain production in this country when no restrictions or restraints are activated in the rest of the Community. Indeed, aid to the potato industry in the rest of the Community has the opposite effect of encouraging rather than discouraging production. How can the Opposition say that there is something unique about the potato that causes it to be better treated, in that way when all the people who use the potato for processing, and therefore do not get the same protection as the ware purchaser, say that the potato marketing scheme exports jobs and acreage to the rest of Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram). Those companies are free to contract with any British producer. The scheme does not prevent them from doing so. If they think that the target area and the quota are not sufficient to meet their requirements, they can ask
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>233</span>
for them to be increased. That is the system. To repeat, there are producers in this Room who have not been asked whether they are prepared to provide potatoes to fulfil the requirements of the processors to whom the hon. Member for Devizes referred. He might well ask why the producers in this Room have not been offered the contracts. The answer is that the processors want an overhang in the potato market. That reduces prices and is exactly what is happening in the wool market, which we shall debate on Tuesday. There is an overhang in the international wool market, and the effect has been to reduce the price of the commodity. Exactly the same applies in this case. If there is an over-production of potatoes in one market and a free market in the Community, people can move their potatoes across boundaries. In those circumstances, if there is an overhang, prices will drop and processors will want to pick up the potatoes. It is an elementary business principle that people go for the cheaper source.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It does not work like that in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may say that but I shall consider it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has introduced four preposterous theories: first, he suggests that he knows more about potato processing than those who actually do the job. One thing that we should all have learnt is that the people who perform the job and who have to earn the money are likely to have an opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman suggests that the British market can be dealt with on its own in the circumstances of a single market. That is a fundamental difference between us. I am committed to the single market and I recognise that it exists. The hon. Gentleman claims to be committed to the single market but will not recognise its reality. He talks about overhanging the market. There is a huge overhang in the market at the moment—it is called continental production. Because that overhangs the market, in the future as in the past, much of the processing that should take place in this country will go elsewhere on the continent because the market is overhung by those who can produce there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah, there is the admission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may say that in that tone, but he should accept the reality of a single market. He voted for the single market—at least, his party voted in favour of it. The reality of the single market is, that anything can be produced and sold in any part of it. If one part of the market decides to make production inherently more complex and expensive than another, those who want to process and sell will go elsewhere. That is the nature of the market and it does not help to pretend that it is not. Any esoteric discussion will not escape from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third preposterous claim made by the hon. Member for Workington was that there is no overhang in the United Kingdom market. The Potato Marketing Board is intervening at £10 per tonne and dyeing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>234</span>
produce for feed stock. The system does not produce what the hon. Gentleman suggests that it would produce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, the idea that a potato processor has simply to fulfil a contract is preposterous. The contract must be executed within the scheme. If the processor does that, he must contract on the terms fixed by the joint board. Those terms must be based on a principle that ensures that one producer gets more for his potatoes than his competitors or there is no point in having the board. That system works while producers are protected by the £35 a tonne that it costs to bring potatoes across the channel. When it comes to processing, however, the system drives jobs abroad because it tries to make a partial market out of a single market, which cannot be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put forward our proposals because we do not want to disadvantage our producers in the single market. I want to ensure that they can sell competitively while they have a chance of winning markets at home and abroad. If we continue with a system that disadvantages them, such as the present system, the British market for the processed product will be increasingly served by producers from other EC countries. As the Minister with responsibility for agriculture, my job is not to protect the interests of foreign producers, but to promote the interests of British producers. To do that, we must be able to change the scheme in such a way as to protect the interests of home producers and ensure that we can compete throughout the single market as the best potato industry in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not delay the Committee because I understand that we are working to a tight timetable to complete the debate by 7 o'clock—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] I am being frank about it, and I understand that that is the arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take the right hon. Gentleman back a stage. He referred to processors in the United Kingdom being placed at a disadvantage. Processors in the United Kingdom want access to potatoes when they fall below a given price in the EC because they believe that they might be placed at a competitive disadvantage in the United Kingdom if they were to pay a higher price. They want to exploit the instability that exists in EC markets, as evident from the collapse of the potato price in France and Belgium. The right hon. Gentleman is arguing that processors should be able to take advantage of a similar collapse in prices in the United Kingdom. He is trying to set up some sort of regime in the United Kingdom that allows for the collapse of the potato price. I know that that price collapsed this year, but the right hon. Gentleman wants to establish a regime which allows for its more frequent collapse. I say that in light of the evidence produced in the report of the school of management and finance of Nottingham university entitled "An Uncommon Potato Regime for Europe", which stated that there was greater variability of yield in the United Kingdom, although less variability in price. The report highlights the fact that the potato marketing scheme has built into the arrangements a stability unavailable in other parts of the EC. In winding up the scheme, the Minister is trying to give the processors the opportunity to exploit circumstances of European market instability, such as those which exist currently and which will exist more frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party rejects that solution. I believe passionately in free-market principles. Over the years, I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>235</span>
have always advocated them. My own background was in business, and I have no prejudice or bias against the free market. I accept free-market principles, but not where they provide for instability that can be exploited by people such as potato processors. They want an unstable market whereas thousands of producers have built their businesses and made their business plans on the basis of a stable market. Those producers want stability and look to the scheme to provide it for the longer term. They recognise that there will be bad years—as there have been recently—but, taking the good with the bad, they expect the scheme to provide long-term stability. They are not prepared to go down the European route free of any regime, which would allow instability to dominate their business and determine the price of their product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require Ministers to take into account "the need for arrangements" to provide for an element of stability within the United Kingdom based, perhaps, on the retention of some elements of the existing scheme. That is all that we are asking for. The amendment requires not the retention of the existing scheme but the Government to consider the necessity of ensuring that measures are in place to protect the industry in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rightly referred to the 16,000 who work in the processing industry. I am satisfied that if the scheme is retained, they will be looked after, because processors are already announcing investment in plants in the United Kingdom. Companies are investing in new processing facilities. We must look after not only their interests but those of producers who see the writing on the wall, in the event that Ministers choose at some stage to wind up the scheme over a 12-month period. They believe that they will not survive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not argue that they necessarily should survive in 10 or 15 years' time. It may well be that following a rationalisation of the industry and a movement toward the co-operative framework that exists in other parts of the European Community, with some vertical integration in the market, we could accept that the scheme should be amended in a major way. I concede the processors' case in that regard to some extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that the scheme should be changed in the way that the Minister has proposed. As I have said, the Minister referred to 16,000 jobs. Thousands of people could lose their living immediately if Ministers take such a decision. They do not believe that they could survive in the very free-market conditions that the Minister wants to impose upon them. If the Minister wants to take people down that route, he must do so cleverly, subtly, slowly and sensitively. The Bill will not provide for that; it will impose free-market conditions that will do much damage to British producers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I have been provoked again by the Minister. That happens all the time. He is good at demonology, and today he has tried to demonise the potato marketing scheme. He sought to characterise the Potato Marketing Board as a restrictive producer cartel, whose only objective was to create a shortage of potatoes and to force up the price of potatoes to British consumers, thereby victimising the poor little
	<span class='label label-info column'>236</span>
processing companies. Even for the Minister, that is an excessive exaggeration. It is just not true. He knows as well as I do that the objective of the Potato Marketing Board is to ensure that supply meets demand, to work out what demand will be and to try to ensure that a sufficient quantity of quality potatoes is produced to satisfy the market for ware potatoes and processing potatoes. It has worked well over the years and in the interests of all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To suggest that the Potato Marketing Board is interested in creating a shortage is a diabolical distortion of the facts. I fear that if there was nothing like the Potato Marketing Board, there would be a serious over-supply in the market in some years. That would be much worse. Instead of the problem perceived now, there would be surpluses and potatoes rotting in the stores. Good quality potatoes would rot and be dumped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is happening this year? There is a vast over-supply of potatoes. They have been bought at £10 a tonne, have rotted and been fed to stock. What is that but an over-supply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the position would be any better under the free-for-all he suggests? He highlighted the fact that this is a difficult market. The physical and climatic contraints that apply to the production of potatoes mean that there are greater supplies in one year and lower supplies in another. With the aid of the potato marketing scheme, we can make the best of a difficult market. It has worked pretty well over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gummer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask the hon. Gentleman a question I have asked almost every Opposition Member who has spoken—will he name one other product to which we should apply the principle of the Potato Marketing Board, namely, the restriction of production at home while allowing unlimited production in the rest of the single market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A red herring is still a red herring, however often the Minister tries to raise that point. It is irrelevant. He seeks to interfere with a scheme that works well and does not discriminate against anybody.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain processors have inspired an argument involving two factors—first that certain processing factories have located in the Netherlands rather than in the United Kingdom; and secondly, that the potato marketing scheme exists in the United Kingdom. The Minister said a dozen times that those two factors are related and that the location of the processing factories in the Netherlands rather than in the United Kingdom is all to do with the potato marketing scheme. That is like blaming the National Farmers Union for Scotland for the fact that I have had a poor lambing percentage this year. I am a member of the National Farmers Union for Scotland and I have lost a certain number of lambs this year, but that has nothing to do with the National Farmers Union for Scotland. It has to do with the weather, just as problems in the potato industry are to do with the weather.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I warn the Minister—I shall now fall back on Latin—beware of the principle of post hoc, ergo propter hoc. He is jumping to conclusions and, having jumped to a certain conclusion, he is also jumping into legislation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Cook. I had concluded my remarks. I assume that if the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Cook.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifton-Brown</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sought to intervene when the hon. Member for East Lothian was speaking—but given that he has finished, I do not want to make a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for that explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to respond to some of the points made by the Minister. He tried to lead the Committee into believing that that restrictive organisation, the Potato Marketing Board, was forcing up prices and so on. It is worth examining the process of how the target acreage is set, who takes part in that process and who finally approves it. The joint consultative committee comprises 19 members, and I shall outline its make-up. It comprises one representative of the consumers' liaison committee;
	<span class='label label-info column'>238</span>
one representative of the National Consumer Council—both of those represent customers—one representative of the independent retailers, the Retail Fruit Federation; one representative of the British Retailers Association; one representative of the Produce Packing and Marketing Association; one representative of the Scottish Potato Trades Association; one representative of the National Federation of Fish Fryers; three representatives of the Potato Processors Association and one representative of the National Joint Council of British Potato and Vegetable Merchants Association. The representatives of the customers total 11 members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the growers side, the committee comprises one representative of the Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives; one representative of the National Farmers Union of Scotland; two representatives of the NFU and three representatives of the producers from the Potato Marketing Board. All those representatives, plus one independent chairman, make up the 19 members of the committee. The customers of the growers have 11 representatives, while the producers have seven representatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The joint consultative committee was set up in 1990, at which time its members were unanimous about the total acreage. In 1991, dissent was expressed by the Scottish producers and the Scottish merchants. In 1992, dissent about the acreage was expressed only by the Scottish merchants. There was no word from the Potato Processors Association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given all the damnation that is being heaped on that restrictive organisation, the Potato Marketing Board, it is interesting that it can only make recommendations. It recommends to the Secretary of State what the target acreage should be and he approves it. If the Potato Marketing Board is such a demon, why on earth does not the right hon. Gentleman throw the recommendation back at the board and say, "I do not accept your target acreage; my friend, the Potato Processors Association, demands more acreage. You must satisfy its demand"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth is that there is no demand from the Potato Processors Association for extra acreage—all its members want are cheaper potatoes to process. They can get that because of the hidden subsidies on the continent, which still overcome the £35 per tonne transport tariff. That is the real issue. The Minister has it in his power to increase the acreage but he has not done so because, in his heart, he knows that the issue is price, not acreage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are technical and tidying amendments that clarify the position following the introduction of amendments to the Bill in another place. As originally drafted, the Bill said that the marketing board "may" submit a transfer scheme for approval. As amended in another place, it now says that it "shall" do so, subject to any poll. Therefore, amendments Nos. 147 and 150 would remove the ability of the board to withdraw a scheme once submitted on the ground that as it is now required to submit it, clearly it would be illogical to allow it to withdraw it the following day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 151 makes clear the relationship between a poll and the board's power to submit a transfer scheme. The present wording is "subject to any poll", which is not clear. The amendment would make it clear that if a majority of votes cast were against the board submitting a transfer scheme, it must abide by that decision.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is, I believe, an appropriate point at which to raise questions about property rights when the British potato marketing scheme is wound up. I raise the matter not as a consequence of an interest of mine, but because people in my constituency may have an interest. What will happen to basic acreages and potato quotas which, unlike quotas for other commodities, have capital value? People may have invested in purchasing basic acreages—in other words, the right to grow potatoes. With the winding up of the scheme, that will disappear.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful for your protection, Mr. Cook. I am raising a detailed point, but we have discussed it in the context of milk and I perceived similar problems in relation to milk quota in the future. The Government have administered that European Community scheme in such a way that private individuals have bought milk quota, which has a capital value and has been traded. That Government-created asset has been bought by individual producers in good faith, so if they suddenly discover that it has been legislated out of existence they may feel that they have been cheated.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If there were a non-quota scheme, the acreage and the quota would disappear.

They took the precaution of leasing rather than buying the quota.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister slid out of that question sideways by speaking about leases. There have been cases in which people have bought basic acreage for substantial sums of money—possibly not in recent years, but it has happened. They had every right to assume that that would be a long-standing, even permanent, feature of the potato market. The Government are now cheerfully legislating it out of existence.

That is rather like holding a referendum and saying that no attention will be paid to the outcome. Perhaps the Minister will give the Committee an essay on that. What is the point of having a poll if the Government will pay no attention to the result?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can explain clause 36. The Bill requires the board to apply to Ministers for approval of a transfer scheme, subject to any poll of registered producers. Clause 25 requires the board to take reasonable steps to bring any transfer scheme to the notice of registered producers, although that need not be by means of a poll. Clause 36 provides the board with the necessary powers to poll registered producers in those circumstances. Subsection (1)(a) relates to a poll on whether there should be a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
successor body, and subsection (1)(b) allows the board to poll on the merits of a specific scheme. Although the results of any poll would not be binding on the board, it would clearly need a cogent reason for disregarding the views of producers. Deletion of the clause would mean that the board would have to submit a transfer scheme under clause 24 as there would be no statutory powers for it to seek the views of registered producers.

The clause removes potatoes from the list of produce in respect of which marketing schemes may be created. The consequence of the clause is that although under the 1958 Act producers may reapply for a scheme, if the Bill is enacted with clause 40 intact that right will disappear. Are Ministers convinced that it is necessary to remove that right in the Bill? When replying to me about an earlier amendment, the Minister showed some flexibility for the longer term. He said that the Government might have to take those matters into account in the future if the new market within the community were seen to be damaging British interests. Cannot the Minister foresee a change, if not of Government, of circumstance, in which producers would need to apply for a scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not see the justification for the amendment. It would introduce an affirmative resolution procedure for the removal of part of the 1958 Act—the parliamentary counsel's word is "disapplication", and I must use the correct technical word. I do not see the case for delaying a decision until after the scheme has been revoked. Disapplication is a logical consequence of ending the scheme and would remove the possibility of establishing a new scheme. It is a bit daft to go to all the trouble of ending the present scheme, but to keep the means to bring it back again. Eventually, any new scheme would have to pass the hurdles of the Commission and the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976. I doubt that it would be easy for it to do so. The amendment would not advance matters and I advise the Committee against accepting it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we come to the heart of the matter. The Secretary of State told us earlier that he had no ideological bent on the matter; he was not wound up by some political philosophy; he was considering the
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
matter pragmatically, logically and rationally. The Bill now refers to something that is not required for its successful implementation. If the provision were omitted, the Government could still secure their objectives. However, the Minister says that it does not seem sensible to go this far and then not remove the power. Why not leave the power intact? If it is possible that producers might want to press Ministers to reintroduce the scheme, why should we have to legislate all over again? Why not retain the power in the Bill? Nothing would be lost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add to that plea? It is extraordinary that we should be going to all this trouble to exclude the possibility of any scheme. Am I right in thinking that any scheme inside or outside the EC, light, medium or heavy—would require more primary legislation? Given that the Minister has previously said that it is extremely important to recognise that he only gets a shot at a major Bill such as this every so often, would it not be sensible to leave the provision intact? If it is not necessary, that is fine, but it will save a great deal of our successors' time, or, indeed, our own—in a few years if a scheme is found to be necessary or desirable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, under the 1958 Act, if an application were made to Ministers for a new scheme, they would have little discretion to refuse it. There seems little point in taking steps in the Bill to end the scheme if we do not also ensure that one cannot be imposed upon us in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some overkill here. The Minister is not satisfied with dismantling and destroying the existing scheme; he is determined to bolt the door behind him to ensure that nobody can ever set up anything like it—or even a much more limited scheme. I can easily envisage circumstances in which people in all parts of the industry think that there is a strong case for putting together a market promotion scheme. It would be entirely benign, even in the Minister's eyes. However, he is taking advantage of this piece of primary legislation to ensure that nothing like that can happen under the 1958 Act. Why not leave that residual power, which would enable the Minister or a successor to enter into dialogue with the potato industry or to set up another scheme in the future? Why, having crossed the bridge, is he going to blow it up behind him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that under the Act, the day after a scheme ends, Ministers could be asked to approve an all but identical new scheme, and would have little discretion to refuse it—[Hon. Members: "Why?"] That is what the 1958 Act says. It seems illogical to bring a scheme to an end and leave powers enabling a surrogate scheme to be brought into existence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a copy of the 1958 Act. Perhaps the Minister could consult with his officials and tell me where in the Act it says what he put to the Committee—[	<i>Interruption.</i>] Perhaps I should keep on talking about these matters nonsensically until the Minister has had time to secure a reply. I do not say that out of disrespect for the Minister, but it is important to establish what this matter is about.

Section 1 of the 1958 Act deals with the submission of schemes, section 2 deals with approval of schemes, section

	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
3 deals with the constitution of boards to administer schemes and appointment of executive committees and section 4 deals with the registration of producers and taking a poll of registered producers on the question of whether the scheme is to remain in force—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has done quite enough; I am most grateful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this rare occasion, I, too, am grateful. A copy of Halsbury's statutes has been thrust into my hands. Section 2(7) of the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the Minister, after making such modifications, if any, as aforesaid, is satisfied that the scheme will conduce to the more efficient production and marketing of the regulated product, he may, subject to subsection (9) of this section, lay before Parliament a draft scheme".</p></blockquote>
The legal advice I have received is that in practice "may" would be likely to constrain Ministers. We seem to speak on a different wavelength to the lawyers. I have been informed that, according to legal opinion, the force of the word "may" is as close to "must" as dammit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consult with his officials and seek legal advice on why Parliament did not insert the word "shall" if what was meant was "shall"? There is a difference between "may" and "shall".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must advise the Committee that like many aspects of this place, this situation is almost theatrical—officials do not exist. Hon. Members must not even make reference to the people to whom I have just referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have set some important precedents this evening, Mr. Cook, including ruling yourself out of order. I hope that that will go into the next edition of Erskine May.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. The hon. Member for Devizes got it in one. Is it Erskine May or Erskine Shall? We have endured many debates for month after month and in Committee after Committee. After 15 years in this place I cannot remember how many times I have debated whether we should substitute "may" for "shall". Now we learn that the legal advice to the Minister of State is that it does not matter a fig and that "may" always means "shall". That is flabbergasting after all those debates and cannot possibly be right. If Ministers have a discretionary power to implement a scheme—for example, a scaled-down scheme rather than a production restriction
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
scheme—why should they not exercise their discretion in a proper parliamentary context and decide whether it is right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are used to non-paper. We now have non-people and perhaps the Committee will permit me to take some non-advice. If my interpretation is wrong and there is a significant contrary view, I will report that to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already received advice and I am bound to observe that for the moment, but if there is a substantial reason for reversing that advice or if I discover that it means something else, I undertake to bring that before the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has undertaken to bring the revised advice to the Committee. Perhaps he will go a little further. If the dangers that he suggests exist do not exist—that if our argument—would he then consider whether the clause is necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the spirit of openness which characterises our deliberations in the Committee, I shall do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Corston</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister delete "substantial" from his undertaking? He referred to a substantial reason—but if there is any reason, surely he should reconsider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We may be coming close to repeating an earlier discussion. If there are reasonable grounds, I shall act accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reasonable grounds the amount of digging may come up with all sorts of things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
