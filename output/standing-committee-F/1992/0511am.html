	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we begin, I have an announcement to make. Government new clause 9 is starred on the amendment paper because, due to a printing error, it did not appear on yesterday's blue pages at the back of the Order Paper. Normally, I would not accept a starred amendment or new clause, but in this case it was not the Minister's fault that the new clause did not appear at the normal time. I propose to exercise my discretion and to select new clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that all the Government amendments to schedule 2 should be considered together and, if there are no protests we shall do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 60, in page 21, line 28, after "horticulture", insert "and industrial crops".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 102, in page 21, line 29, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"() the establishment of marketing co-operatives,".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the face of it, this is a small amendment and I shall explain its importance not only to our deliberations but to the national economic interest and scientific research development. David Naish, president of the National Farmers Union, speaking about set aside on 21 January 1993, said:
	<br><q><p>"I have never believed it was a long-term solution to over production. I do think it will last until the end of the current Common Agricultural Policy reform period in 1995, and probably beyond,".</p></q>
He continued:
	<br><q><p>"the pressures will grow on us as an industry to find alternative uses for the land such as using it for biofuel production, creating access, and improving the environment."</p></q>
We must define industrial crops. They are crops from which it is possible to manufacture biofuels—liquid esters from edible oils, typically oil-seed rape in Europe, soya in the USA and canola oil in Canada. They are genuine diesel substitutes. Petrol substitutes tend to be ethanol derivatives, including ethyl-tertiary-butyl-ether, which is used in high-octane fuels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Europe, rape methyl ester—RME—is likely to be the main source of biofuels and is produced from oil-seed rape by crushing, followed by a chemical esterification, separation and cleaning process. The process is relatively straightforward. One hectare, yielding between 2.2 and 3.3 tonnes of rape seed, would produce between 0.7 to 1.1 tonnes of RME. An important byproduct is glycerine, which is very useful in industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>248</span>
Recent comment in the scientific, industrial and farming press has been interesting. In December 1992, 	<i>Lloyd's List</i> referred to a study by the Scottish agricultural college, which found that biofuel can be obtained at prices comparable with taxed fuel, which is about 34p per litre. That competes with mineral-derived diesel, which is bought by large bus companies. The article explained that trials were being conducted in Austria. Indeed, the Department of Transport is playing an active role in similar work that is being carried out at Reading university.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cereals, sugar beet and other crops provide all sorts of possibilities as alternatives to petrol. Following a chance remark made the other day by my hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours), I became interested in the abundance of willow in my garden. On reading the technical literature, I was surprised to learn that it is being considered as a possible fuel. Bioethanol can be produced by breaking down lignocellulose in wood and straw and by using enzymes followed by a fermentation process. I am not thinking of my interest in my garden when I say that the research is worth undertaking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A detailed article by David Richardson in the 	<i>Financial Times</i> in July 1992 referred to such research. I recommend that members of the Committee read that and a report published in December by the parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, which sets out interesting ideas on using biofuels for transport. The EC believes that up to 5 per cent. of our motor fuel needs could be obtained from biofuels. According to rough calculations, that would require an area of land two to five times larger than that which is set aside. The crops would have to provide raw materials for biofuel production and that would raise controversial issues which would need to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fiscal regime for the industry is crucial. It provides a challenge to the Government, who have yet to produce a coherent energy strategy. I accept that the Ministers present today cannot be blamed for the absence of such a strategy, but they can stamp their authority on the issue and develop the debate by accepting amendment No. 60.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the concept of the Department of Trade and Industry co-operating with another Department may appear novel to the empire builders in Parliament, it is, nevertheless, critical to our argument. The clause states that the Government's strategy must include
	<br><q><p>"the organisation, promotion, encouragement, development, co-ordination or facilitation of marketing in Great Britain or elsewhere of"</p></q>
in this case, biofuels. It would make much sense to add the words in our amendment, "and industrial crops". That would not immediately facilitate a way forward, but it would create an environment in which important research could be undertaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate on the environmental impact is extremely complex, but the use of biofuels in a small-niche market, where the advantages of greater biodegradability can be exploited—for example, in inland waterways or urban areas—presents us with some interesting benefits. The issue must be dealt with carefully as there are important counter considerations. I want to study in detail the research report from Aberdeen university, which has recently been referred to in the media. The report relates to the prevalence of asthma in rape production areas.

In the 	<i>New Scientist</i> in October 1992, Tara Patel wrote:
	<br><q><p>"Environment researchers are sharply divided over the benefits of running vehicles on 'biofuels' made from plants, mixed with fossil fuels. The hope is that such a mixture will cut pollution and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases."</p></q>
That is countered by Axel Friedrich who headed a study that stated:
	<br><q><p>"even without taking into account greenhouse gas-emission, the soil pollution caused by the chemicals necessary for intensive farming is enough to make RME undesirable."</p></q>
That view is challenged by the French National Institute for Agricultural Research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As recently as 4 March 1993, an article in 	<i>The Scotsman</i>—again, curiously, 	<i>The Scotsman</i> is covering matters that effect the Committee in far more detail than some of the the English newspapers—stated:
	<br><q><p>"Oilseed rape has been give a clean bill of health—medically and commercially—by a group of Scottish scientists."</p></q>
The article refers to the Aberdeen research and goes on:
	<br><q><p>"They say its reputation as a yellow peril causing all kinds of widespread allergic reactions during its flowering period from late April to early July is a media creation with no scientific basis."</p></q>
In this place, we know a lot about media creations, but that was a scientific comment. The scientists acknowledge that
	<br><q><p>"occasionally individuals, including research workers who handle the crop, do become allergic. 'Whilst reiterating that allergic reactions to oilseed rape is a relatively rare occurence, it is also worth noting the very positive health benefits that oilseed rape oil consumption can confer on the community in terms of reduced cholesterol,' says Dr. Clive Harper of the department of environmental and occupational medicine at Aberdeen University."</p></q>
Dr. Harper is one of four scientists who have been engaged in the detailed study of about 2,000 people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The links between chest-related complaints and oil-seed rape do not seem to be well founded at this stage although, as I remarked earlier, I have yet to see the detailed report; I am quoting from a newspaper article about the report, which goes on:
	<br><q><p>"In each case, more than 20 per cent of the population complained of seasonal symptoms, such as headaches, wheezing, rhinitis, eye irritation and itchy skin. Those in high OSR"—</p></q>
oil seed rape—
	<br><q><p>areas tended to blame that crop while in non-OSR areas they blamed other plants."</p></q>
The link has not been proven.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has gone on in far more detail in France. A lively article was published in 	<i>The Guardian</i> last November stating:
	<br><q><p>"In their continual quest to calm restive farmers, France's Socialists"—</p></q>
we normally hear boos at the mention of that from Conservative Members—
	<br><q><p>"have crossbred the carrot and the stick—and come up with the humble beet. A prime source of ethanol usable as a fuel substitute, the beet has dual properties. It has recently become a sweet enticement for a bitter monde rural and a useful tool to brandish at the oil industry."</p></q>
The article went on to say that the tax waiver created in France has been made permanent and that
	<br><q><p>"a high-level commission led by the former head of Renault has been convened to study the issue, and both state-controlled oil companies, Elf Aquitaine and Total, have announced biofuel refining and distribution for 1993."</p></q>
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>250</span>
Elf provided the coup de grâce with splashy newspaper advertisements, following the recent formula one victory of British racing driver Nigel Mansell. Elf proclaimed that he won using petrol mixed with 10 per cent. of ethanol compounds derived from beet. Mansell's victories last year were put down to the use of sugar beet in his petrol. I thought that putting sugar in petrol caused damage, but Elf has obviously cracked the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key influence on the future of biofuels in the United Kingdom will, at least in the short term, be the eligibility for tax subsidies of demonstration plants and pilot studies under the current EC directive on the harmonisation of taxes. I hope that the Government will be wise enough to recognise that during the passage of the Finance (No. 2) Bill. The Committee can aid that process, putting in place one more piece of the jigsaw, by accepting the amendment. It is intended not to put in place masses of oil-seed rape production but to facilitate an important economic and scientific debate. That debate must take place as part of an overall review of energy needs, not only of the United Kingdom but of the whole of the European Community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Tyler 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Cornwall)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like, briefly, to refer to amendment No. 60. I hope that I shall be forgiven for speaking also to amendment No. 102. The Minister may then speak to both amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Mr. Miller) about the importance of industrial crops, particularly biofuels. The amendment marks an opportunity for the Government to expound their policy. Now is clearly the right time to do so, and this is as good a forum as any.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of the continuing amicable relationship that exists between both sides of the Committee, and in response to requests from friends on both sides, I promised that I would make no mention this morning of Newbury. Rather than refer to lost majorities or lost deposits, I want to refer to lost opportunities. Farmers in my constituency seem to have other features of the IACS system uppermost in their minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the extent that the Bill featured in our discussions, the general reaction was, "So what? Is this but a mouse?" They understand the significance of the Bill for potato and milk marketing, but they wonder whether it marks a major change in how producers market their produce. At present, for Scots, the verdict is not proven; for England and Wales, the jury is still out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see no evidence—perhaps the Minister will be able to encourage us—of new money, a new initiative or a new push behind agricultural marketing, which is especially important for co-operatives. Ignoring the milk marketing board, which will remain a special case, the United Kingdom has the lowest percentage of output from co-operatives of any member state. At present, co-operatives produce 10 per cent. of our output, but the figure is 28 per cent. in Germany, more than 50 per cent. in France and more than 76 per cent. in Denmark. Co-operatives are a major element of the way in which producers manage to obtain a decent, sensible living from the land. It is significant that the United Kingdom has many co-operatives—more than 560—but a lot of them are not heavily into marketing; some are simply buyers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Plunkett Foundation for Co-operative Studies recently issued two interesting and encouraging
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>251</span>
publications, the theme of which was that, despite all the handicaps, co-ops are managing to survive and to grow—but slowly. Surely, at every opportunity, we should try to ensure that they can grow faster and achieve a stronger place in the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the Plunkett Foundation,
	<br><q><p>"The message is clear—the farmer controlled business sector must become bigger, better, more effective and efficient in business, if farming is to survive in anything like its present form."</p></q>
It further states:
	<br><q><p>"In the final analysis, all farmer controlled businesses are about one thing—economic power."</p></q>
In other parts of the European Community, the co-operative movement has shown precisely how powerful it can be if given the opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most British farmers are comparatively small operators. It is apparent from our discussions in Committee that many parties have an interest in how the marketing of milk and potatoes will be undertaken in the future. But, on the whole, producers are small fry and the sharks in the pool are large.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. D. N. Campbell-Savours 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Workington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have often wondered why Britain has such a bad record on co-operative development. Has the hon. Gentleman any theories about that? I ask him that seriously. What is the problem? Why cannot we develop that movement on the scale of agricultural communities in Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am no expert, but have a hunch that there are three reasons. First, in other member states, farmers have traditionally come together on a regional and a national basis to create their own banking and lending institutions. That has been an enormous help to many of the marketing co-operatives, at least in the northern European states of the Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, at least some of our competitors—perhaps because of the pressure of events rather than natural enthusiasm—have come to accept that the co-operative way is the better way. I think especially of the Dutch. Since the last world war, the Dutch have achieved a tremendous amount in co-operation both in horticulture and in agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, judging from my visits to Brittany—which is a kind of twin area with Cornwall—the French Government have recognised that investment in regional co-operatives is a most effective way of obtaining good value from investment, and enormous improvements have been achieved. I look with envy across the western approaches to Brittany where horticultural and agricultural producers—compared with those in Cornwall and the south-west of England—have obtained much more investment support from central Government. That is evident on the ground, even to the extent of there being 100 per cent. grant-aided buildings, which could never be achieved anywhere in this country, even in a region with assisted-area status.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are probably the three reasons. We cannot suddenly catch up over a few years, but surely the Bill gives us the opportunity to show that the Government and, I hope, all parties in the House, consider that the co-operative way has much to commend it. Hence, this is an opportunity that should not be missed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cirencester and Tewkesbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman missed the real reason
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>252</span>
why we have failed to co-operate in agricultural marketing. It is simply that rationing did not end until 1956; our entire agricultural policy was geared towards increased output to feed the nation. It is often forgotten how close to starvation we came during the second world war. The agricultural industry kept this country alive. That was not true in Holland, Denmark and other EC countries, where agriculture accounted for more than 50 per cent. of their economies. Therefore, they had to export to survive and to enable their economies to prosper. They could export successfully only by co-operating on marketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) was in the Chamber the other day when I quoted some statistics. Britain has a balance of trade deficit of £5.5 billion while Holland has a balance of trade surplus of £10 billion and exports £1.6 billion of its produce to Britain alone. The Bill, and especially the clause, will encourage the agricultural community to co-operate, especially in the milk and potato sectors—which I know quite well—even more than at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, for some of those reasons, it is important that the agricultural industry loses some of its inhibitions and starts co-operating on the marketing of its produce to overcome the very serious balance of payments deficit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I think that he is adding a fourth reason rather than removing any of my three. If, in so doing, he is endorsing the clause and the amendment, I am extremely grateful to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall take him up on one point. We do not just need marketing co-operatives on a healthier scale than in the past to achieve greater potential in our export market. We also need to achieve greater potential in our home market. I accept what the hon. Gentleman says about the Dutch, but they would be surprised to hear that they did not suffer from food rationing. They certainly did. My Dutch friends ate bulbs in the cellars, both during and after the war. It would not be an entirely fair comparison to suggest that this country has achieved great things without co-operation. We have had an extremely good opportunity—which we have taken—but that opportunity has, in recent years, tended to fade. As the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury quite rightly says, the result is a balance of trade of which none of us can be proud. We should be more self-sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to be lured too far back into history. I want to consider the future. It is now critical to give producers the muscle power in the market to enable them to compete with some big organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During my visit to Newbury, my sample of one—statistically, it is as significant as some other polls—suggested that the critical issue is not who is selling but who is buying. A number of buyers in all too many agricultural commodities are being reduced to a few, even to a handful. All too often the buying power of those few is so considerable that they can dictate the terms of trade—the conditions, the quality and the quantity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Ainger 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Pembroke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that as there are potato growers in his constituency the hon. Gentleman is aware that the average price to the producer fell during the 1992 glut by 40 per cent. whereas the price to the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>253</span>
housewife of new potatoes in the supermarket rose by 8 per cent. That classically illustrates his point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quoted in this Committee and on Second Reading the longer-term changes in a number of commodities, including milk, whereby farmgate prices have hardly increased but the price on supermarket shelves has increased dramatically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is our opportunity to give the producer increased muscle power so that the growing discrepancy between farmgate and supermarket prices is reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Ancram 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Devizes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with great care to the hon. Gentleman, who is enthusing about marketing co-operatives and seeking Government assistance for them. I remember that at the beginning of the Committee he voted against the provision on Milk Marque, which I understood to be a co-operative of producers. Perhaps he could explain that inconsistency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made it clear from the outset—on Second Reading and in Committee—that I would strongly welcome an effective producer co-operative. That does not mean that what was proposed was precisely the co-operative for which we were looking. Indeed, the restrictions on the possible future of Milk Marque may prove to be its undoing. It will not be as effective, powerful or useful to producers as it might be.

It is the Committee's role to ensure that smaller players in the market have an effective voice. All too often, the big operators are consulted by Government, and they are often the best at briefing us. Smaller players do not have the loudest voice. We can best fulfil our role by emulating the effective advances that have been made in other member states towards achieving strong marketing co-operatives. Many farmers in this country have avoided joining a co-operative simply because they could not see what was in it for them. Perhaps that point was behind the intervention of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. We must make it possible for farmers to see what is in it for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been some modest improvements in recent years in the Govenment's sponsorship, endorsement and funding of marketing. The improvement that the Minister announced at the beginning of April in the group marketing grant was welcome in terms of both flexibility and the scope of the schemes that it could include. However, the critical factor will be what pound sign is given to it. If the grant is simply limited pump priming, it will not achieve the expansion that all members of the Committee want. If it is an effective investment in seed-corn for the long-term development of group co-operative schemes, that will be a different matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note that the group marketing grant does not distinguish between a purely commercial group and one that has more of the features of a traditional mainstream co-operative. I hope that in future it will be possible to differentiate between them to give special help with the undoubtedly difficult problems of setting up the organisation for an effective co-operative. It is not easy, for reasons that the Committee will know. Farmers and horticulturalists tend to be supreme individualists. To
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>254</span>
some extent, we have encouraged them to be so. It will require additional help and support to bring them together in effective co-operatives for maketing purposes, particularly in the early stages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fundamental problem that any proposal in this area faces is resources. Any commercial organisation that is tackling a new marketing opportunity knows that it requires very big money—millions of pounds. With the supermarkets, food chains and food-processing chains currently investing considerable sums to try to corner a larger share of the market, there is a real danger that the profit margins of their suppliers, the original producers, will be squeezed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of us—I hope that this will receive support from Conservative members of the Committee—want not just window dressing but the dressing of the land that the farmer recognises as being essential to produce a crop—the fertiliser, be it natural or artificial, that will achieve a real improvement and growth. We do not want just the reshuffling of old money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard two excellent speeches, especially from my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, who gave an excellent and balanced view of the possibilities that biofuels offer this country and the farming industry. We often concentrate to much on farmers. We forget that we should be considering the total rural economy and not merely the benefits or disadvantages of changes as they directly affect farmers. That is why I am so interested in biofuels, which is not a purely farming issue but must be seen in the context of the wider rural area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my constituency, a company called Energy Parks (UK) Ltd. has carried out a great deal of research into the possibility of using set-aside land for growing rape to produce a biofuel which, presumably, would be refined in the local refineries in Milford Haven. It has done so, not because it wants less set-aside and, perhaps, a higher income for farmers, but because it recognises that a biofuel industry would pump an awful lot of money back into the rural economy. The problem with set-aside is that, although a farmer may get his rate per acre, that is all that goes back into the rural economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an important point that I did not cover in my contribution. There is a most interesting statistic in the post briefing to which I referred which states:
	<br><q><p>"One study estimates that a 200,000 hectare wheat-based bioethanol programme could create 2,680 direct jobs in agriculture and processing, and a further 4,020 indirect jobs…"</p></q>
although it does not take into account the balancing effect that that would have in the petrochemical industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that such projects must be considered as a possible way of maintaining support to our important rural economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who reinforces my point. Before I entered Parliament, I was actively involved in the oil industry and what Elf Aquitaine did in relation to ethanol resulted in Nigel Mansell winning the Estoril Grand Prix last year. I do not believe that the oil industry regards biofuels as a threat. Indeed, it is in the forefront of its development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we accept that set-aside is the be all and end all, we should actively encourage ever more serious research
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>255</span>
into biofuel both centrally and by the oil companies and the agriculture industry. That is happening in France and, as I said, it resulted in Nigel Mansell's victory, although it represented only a 10 per cent. substitution of hydrocarbon-based fuel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax regime on biofuels in this country is an enormous disincentive. Under current European Community rules, it is possible for pilot projects to be wholly duty free and it is a great shame that, although this debate has continued for the past year or so, the Chancellor did not zero rate duty on biofuels in his last Budget. The direction from Europe is clear and I understand that the proposal from the EC tax commissioner is that biofuels should have a 90 per cent. reduction in tax compared with the fuels that they replace because of their environmental advantages. I am sure that we all understand that and it is a great shame that the only pilot project relates to three buses in Reading. Compared with what is happening on the continent of Europe, that is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take account of what has been said, especially by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, and respond positively from the points of view of agriculture and, just as importantly, the rural economy and the environment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. I tabled the amendment on industrial crops because I thought it would be interesting for us to debate the whole issue of biofuels, which have captured the imagination of people throughout the country who are involved in debate on the environment. It is interesting that I have received more letters on matters relating to biofuels in recent years than on milk, potatoes, and wool, apart from payment of the hill livestock compensatory allowance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. David Curry)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or Maastricht.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps even Maastricht.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A huge movement is developing which demands changes. I do not know whether any lessons should be learned from Newbury, but people are looking for a new political debate. The party that captures that political agenda will be handsomely rewarded in a general election. I tabled the amendment with a view to developing that debate and giving Ministers the opportunity to reply to the points that have been made very effectively by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston on biofuels and by the hon. Member for North Cornwall on co-operative development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall skip most of my notes, having ceded the right to move the amendment to another, but I shall list some of the products that can be made from rape seed. They include high temperature non-foaming lubricants, plastics, fabric softeners, coatings and adhesives, polymers, soaps, detergents, emulsifiers and livestock meal byproducts. It also produces a fuel that can be used in agriculture, although there are problems with its use in commercial vehicles, because the number of miles per gallon falls and it can cause rubber to decay in engines so that a substitute material must be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many such products can be developed and we know that set aside will be challenged by environmentalists and the general public who will become worried if hundreds
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>256</span>
of thousands of hectares of land are not used and perhaps become overgrown. Ministers should consider the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston about the medical difficulties of large-scale rape seed production. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Jones), who acts as our Patronage Secretary, suffers from hay fever and may challenge those who want to plant too many rape seed fields. I hope that the Minister will explain the Government's view on the development of that product.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, we must be cautious before considering the Williams Renault as an environmentally friendly motor car, whether or not it uses rape seed oil. Its number of miles to the gallon does not commend it to the economically or ecologically conscious motorist, whether or not Nigel Mansell is at the wheel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the solidarity club of all those who suffer from hay fever but rape has one advantage, which the hon. Member for Workington did not mention in being the first major crop of the year on which bees may feed, although rape honey must be extracted without delay because it crystallises quickly. Willow is very versatile and if a piece is cut off and put into the ground, it will grow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the substance of the debate. The reasons put forward on co-ops are valid. Those countries that have had to find an export maket—France has had to do that in a sense by exporting from the south to the north—have developed those structures from small scale agriculture, whereas we in the United Kingdom have a long tradition of importing our food. Therefore, the market was secure. The deficiency payment system did not encourage marketing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger now—and I say this quite frankly—is that the trend of farm incomes and supports is improving greatly. I hope that farmers will not imagine that they can forget marketing concerns, because there will be a period during which the level of support from their classic production will be quite buoyant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is yet any complacency among farmers. They recognise that the blip of devaluation has given them a window of opportunity, but I do not think that any of them would claim that co-operative marketing, or marketing generally, is now less important on a longer-term basis. I share the Minister's view that were that the case, it would be dangerous, but since the green pound is being regularly revalued, I think that the Minister would agree that farmers are continually reminded that they cannot rely on the permanency of devaluation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely true. I was merely expressing the hope that we would not find farmers less inclined towards marketing because there might be an improvement in their basic income flows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We revised the scheme, as the hon. Member for North Cornwall mentioned, after wide consultation. We relaunched the scheme. I went around the country talking extensively to groups of farmers. We learnt of people's concerns and of how they felt that the situation could be improved—for example, the degree of sign-up. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>257</span>
revisions reflect what we were told by people trying to operate the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a successful launch rate. We deliberately did not go for a spectacular great launch, because we wanted it to be routine and part and parcel of the way we deal with agriculture. It was not supposed to be spectacular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are increasing numbers of livestock groups. That is especially encouraging because horticulture is more co-operatively minded in any case and does not have the middle man. Livestock is an area in which, traditionally, there has been greater reluctance. The need to improve quality and to design a product through to the final marketplace is perhaps more important in that sector than in many others. We continue to press in that area in collaboration with the intermediate sectors—the abattoirs—and the final retailers to try and ensure that we are designing a product right through to its consumption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall continue, if necessary, to tweak the scheme here and there. If people tell us that a tweak would make the system operate better, we would have no hesitation in doing that. We do not take a theological view on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some circumstances—where, for example, access to private capital is important—co-operatives might not be the right vehicle. Many of the most effective continental co-operatives have more in common with what we would describe as private limited companies. That is partly because of the fairly restricted rules on mutuality which exist in the United Kingdom. That, of course, is for another Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I invite the hon. Members for Ellesemere Port and Neston and for North Cornwall to withdraw the amendments on the ground that their aims have been completely covered by the Bill. I shall spell that out so that hon. Members do not think that I am spinning them a line. On the amendment on industrial products, the Bill refers to the produce of agriculture. Industrial crops are the product of agriculture—hemp and flax, for example. The Agriculture Act 1947 gives the definitions used in the Bill—agriculture is defined as including, for example, seed growing. Therefore, oilseeds or soya would be covered. Where there is a doubt—for example, willow coppicing—I assure the Committee that we can make an order under clause 44(2)(c). We would be looking for such projects to which we could give assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point made by the hon. Member for North Cornwall about co-operatives. I assure him that we have no predisposition not to support the co-operatives. We deliberately used the term collaborative marketing to encompass people who want to go down a specifically co-operative route and those who want to discuss joint ventures together outside the co-operative framework. The clause is deliberately widely drawn to enable diverse marketing structures appropriate to the relevant sector to be assisted by any scheme in the Bill. I assure the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston that that could include marketing co-operatives. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I favoured the amendment as a probing amendment and I did not realise that there was an element of doubt. It was tabled simply to give us an opportunity to discuss the matter. When my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston referred to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>258</span>
willow and the possibility that it might not fall under areas defined in the 1947 Act, he took me by surprise. If the amendment were watertight, Ministers should accept the addition of industrial crops, because that would avoid the Minister having to introduce an order under clause 44(2)(c). Why go through that exercise if there is an element of doubt later when the amendment would allow the Minister to deal with the matter now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he does not agree to the amendment, perhaps he could signal that there will be a similar amendment on Report. He does not have to accept what I am saying, but will he consider incorporating measures to avoid returning to the House in order to deal with an application which has fallen outside existing legislation and which might defer that applicant's grant?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My only hesitation is that if we specify certain activities, there will be an uncertainty about those not included. I do not want that to happen. I am willing to reflect on what the hon. Member for Workington said, without commitment, but, as I have said, we have carefully considered the amendment. I am glad that we managed to discover something that the hon. Gentleman had not realised. Perhaps that teaches us not to be so careful in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While reflecting on the matter, perhaps the Minister could take advice from his colleagues responsible for science and technology. It is undoubtedly the case that information on this subject is rapidly unfolding. Organic materials are being considered daily and new observations are being made. As I said earlier, I was surprised about the developments on willow and their importance. I ask the Minister to take cognisance of the rapid change and use it to include the words "and industrial crops", which would leave the field wide open. He would not be subject to an argument about an order every time there was a controversial new development, such as willow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister further. I am grateful for his co-operative answer, but he studiously avoided giving any figures. I know that it is difficult to pre-empt what the Government have in mind about the long-term availability of money. Can the Minister give us the outcome figure of marketing grants for 1992–93 and the projected figure for 1993–94? I do not know whether he will be able to go further than that. The take-up in the early months of the mark one grant was disappointing because of the way in which it worked. Even under revised arrangements, I do not foresee—I hope that the Minister will prove me wrong—a dramatic expansion in the number of collaborative groups or co-operative groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have spoken long enough to enable the Minister to obtain the figures he requires. As that now seems to be the case, I shall sit down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had most of what the hon. Gentleman asked for, but I needed one little bit of information to refresh my memory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1992–93 there was a small disbursement. That is because there are feasibility studies and claims for the money are running behind approvals of the schemes. The figure is £20,500. The total committed is about £500,000. Under the existing grant there is provision for £1.72 million in 1993–94, £2.94 million in 1994–95 and £3.55

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>259</span>
million in 1995–96. We expect that money to be fully utilised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 61, in page 22, line 2, leave out "and timing" and insert "timing and regularity".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is another another probing amendment. It gives us the opportunity to debate the distinction between having, in principle, a policy to provide grants and the practice of paying them. Over the years all hon. Members will have seen evidence to suggest that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food can be very tardy indeed in paying grants to farmers. I cannot claim to have had hundred of cases of that over the years, but I have had many cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While regional and national officials have always been extremely helpful, the farming community should not have to resort to the efforts of Members of Parliament to resolve difficulties. There must be a code of practice in the Department, certainly in the context of the new citizens charter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44(3)(d) would
	<br><q><p>"confer a discretion on the appropriate Minister as to the payment of grant, as to the manner and timing of payment of grant and as to the amount of grant".</p></q>
The amendment would insert the words, "and regularity".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from correspondence reported in the agricultural press that shows how widespread the problem is. Perhaps the Minister will explain how the Department deals with such matters and give a response that the agricultural press will hope to use. I know that these matters are of great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have an article from 	<i>Farming News.</i> The headline is:
	<br><q><p>"Anger in Pennines at ESA payment delays."</p></q>
The article concerns grants. It states:
	<br><q><p>"Delayed environmentally sensitive area payments are causing anger and frustration in the Northern Pennines.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>A promise by the Ministry of Agriculture that payment would be made in October has not been kept. And for many there is little prospect of it being paid in November.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>To make matters worse, a good many of the 500 farmers who filled in application forms to join the extended ESA scheme in the spring have heard nothing. They do not know whether their applications have been accepted, let alone when they can expect their first-year payment."</p></q>
I have an article from the 	<i>Farmers Weekly</i> of 20 November 1992. The dates are significant because they occur after a statement made by the Secretary of State to which I shall refer later. The article is headed:
	<br><q><p>"Delay in payment of headage premium penalises hill men."</p></q>
The article states:
	<br><q><p>"West country hill and upland farmers want to use the government's citizens' charter to gain compensation for late payment of livestock headage premiums".</p></q>
	<br><q><p>"Among the campaigners is Henry Haynes…</p></q>
	<br><q><p>At a recent meeting of the South Molton sheep group he found 10 of the 30 members present had not received their first payments under the sheep annual premium scheme. Between them they were due over £45,000."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>260</span>
The article continues:
	<br><q><p>"In his own case late receipt of the payment meant his agreed bank overdraft had to be exceeded thereby incurring a higher interest rate and a daily £2.50 fee on the amount of money owed to him. Fortunately, the bank manager was understanding and allowed him to pay his insurance premiums and quarterly rent".</p></q>
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those matters may appear to be quite petty, but they are important to farmers who are dependent on receipt of grant for their financial viability and, on occasion, survival.
	<br><q><p>"But many bills went unpaid, incurring mounting interest charges. 'Some of those bills were for small local businessmen who are struggling like the rest of us and can ill afford to give us credit. I didn't like not paying them but I had no choice. I had already sold lambs sooner than intended to raise some income. Prof. John Nix of Wye College, asked after a meeting at Exeter, Devon to comment on the effects of delayed support payments on beef and sheep farms, said: 'It is quite inexcusable to put such farms, which are already in the most difficulty, under any further pressure than is absolutely necessary'".</p></q>
The point about those examples is that they show the scale of the problem with the payment of grants. It is helpful and excellent that Ministers should include in part III of the Bill a clause—clause 44—on grants for marketing that sets out the procedures to be followed and the conditions under which grant will be paid. It is unreasonable, if people plan long term on the basis that they will receive such grants and set their cash flow forecasts and agree their business plans with their bank manager accordingly, for the Government not to come up with the cash. Farmers are left holding the baby and have to sell assets at reduced prices or use whatever other means are necessary to raise finance. It is unreasonable to include such measures in a Bill unless the Government are comitted to proper and early payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter dated 21 January 1993 to Mr. Guy Renwick of Holystone Grange, Morpeth. He is an interesting man. Having had trouble with the payment of grant, he wrote to one of the farming newspapers inviting others to contact him with their stories, to some of which I shall briefly refer. One gentleman, who shall remain nameless, because it would be wrong for me to identify him, wrote:
	<br><q><p>"We have received no advances on the 1992 Sheep Annual Premium Scheme, nor the Suckler Cow Subsidy which amount together to over £80,000. Both these subsidies were received before the end of December last year, consequently the amount had been included in our cashflow for December this year"—</p></q>
they presumed that the same would happen this year as last—
	<br><q><p>"The fact that our income is £80,000 short has placed an enormous strain on our resources and has necessitated the selling of cattle well before prime resulting in further losses. Upon inquiry to MAFF at Carlisle we understood that the Suckler Cow Subsidies were only just being processed and the first payments (not necessarily including ours) should go out by the beginning of January. This inquiry was made in December and to date"—</p></q>
21 January—
	<br><q><p>"no payment has been received … We farm over 4,000 hectares of remote hill land employing 23 people, thereby helping to keep the Upper"—</p></q>
part of the area where he lives—
	<br><q><p>"alive. This kind of delay in payments to which we are entitled together with the proposed cuts announced in the level of Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowance, puts an almost intolerable strain on the business."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>261</span>
He then goes to wish Mr. Renwick good fortune in his fight with the Ministry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been given some interesting information by a substantial farming business about its subsidy claims for 1992, which were still unpaid on 21 January 1993. A suckler cow premium claim was submitted on 26 June
1992 for 190 cows at £59.64, a total of £11,331. A hill livestock allowance claim was submitted on 22 February 1992 for 197 cows at £63.30, a total of £12,470. That makes a total claim of £23,801. That had not been paid in January—seven months later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 6 April 1992, the farm also submitted a claim for the sheep annual premium of £17,815. On 22 February 1992 it submitted another claim for £10,035, making a total of £27,801, which had not been paid by January 1993. That was when Mr. Renwick received his correspondence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not good enough. I do not know whether that is caused by a shortage of staff, but people's cash flow is based on receiving that money. I understand the difficulties of Government Departments in spending money. However, to be fair to the Government, I do not believe that the reason for non-payment is that the money is not available. I doubt whether it is a deliberate attempt to delay payment; it is an administrative problem within the Ministry which is not being dealt with perhaps because the arrangements within the Ministry are not sufficiently sophisticated. Will the Minister clarify the position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 	<i>Farming News</i> of 11 December 1992, Mr. Renwick set out his case under the headline
	<br><q><p>"Group plans to sue for losses due to bureaucratic bungling.".</p></q>
The article stated;
	<br><q><p>"A Northumberland farmer who was owed £23,000 by the Ministry because it lost his set-aside files is setting up a protest group for farmers who suffered hardship due to late payment of arable, livestock or environmental subsidies."</p></q>
Some of my constituents have suffered similar difficulties over the years. I am sure that Conservative Members, who, in the main, represent more rural seats than the Opposition, know of similar experiences. They might wish to comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in last year's Budget, the Chancellor gave an undertaking on the payment of bills by all Departments. Civil servants will recall what was said, because they will have to implement that undertaking. I understand also that six months ago the Secretary of State for Agriculture—I insist on giving the Minister that title—sent out a document entitled, "Commitment to Service", which included provisions for an appeals procedure for cases where payments had not been made within three months. I have not seen the document; if we had had time, I am sure that we could have dug out more information, but it came to our attention only yesterday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm whether undertakings have been given? Did that commitment to service have anything to do with MAFF's commitment under the citizens charter, made by the Minister responsible for the citizens charter—I forget his other fancy name—when he gave undertakings on behalf of the various Departments of State? I can sum up in the words of Mr. Renwick who, I understand, is a fierce Conservative; he is not a Socialist of my ilk. He said that the Ministry was anti-farming and was run by non-practical people. That is a heavy
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>262</span>
indictment from a voter, who could just as well have been in Newbury as anywhere else in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister winds up the debate, I hope that he will deal with the problems that, plainly, Mr. Renwick is campaigning to have resolved and with which we have dealt today through our probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I do not have with me details of when payments have been made on various schemes in the past. Had I anticipated the thrust of the remarks of the hon. Member for Workington, I could have had them with me. But I can, at least, respond to the tone of his remarks, if he will permit me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman spoke of delays in the Pennine dales. That, of course, is my constituency. There is a specific reason: when we introduced the extension to the environmentally sensitive area, we got it wrong. We said so at the time. The balance between meadowland, moorland and rough grazing was wrong, so we had to start again from scratch. That is really the origin of the problems in the Pennine dales. Had we persisted, we should no doubt have got the payments out earlier, but it would not have been much of a scheme. That was a specific case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, sometimes we have had problems with the payments. There are several obvious reasons for that. I do not put them forward as excuses; they are simply the background against which we must work. The schemes change quite rapidly. There may be delays in the publication of the official journal of the actual rates that we can pay. For example, the rates for the ewe premium must be formally published before we can make the payments. We have deployed much new technology in reorganised offices; plainly, that combination has caused some difficulties in coping, for instance with the issuing of hundreds of thousands of cattle identification documents. A computer system that goes down three times causes difficulties. We have had all the teething problems of new technology experienced by others, no matter where.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When grants have been fairly straightforward, our payments record is not bad. Occasionally more complicated cases come to Ministers, because we are anxious to ensure that we examine every possible avenue so that the farmers receive what they are entitled to recieve. As I have emphasised in several contexts, we do not start with a predisposition to do a farmer out of a grant. The hon. Member for Workington is fair when he says that any problems that we encounter are not an attempt to manage cash flow. That is certainly not so. It is simply that, occasionally, we have to deal with a large number of matters at once. As in all Government Departments, the resources are necessarily finite. We try to get payments out as fast as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the citizens charter, we have published our targets. We combed through them carefully to ensure that they were realistic and that we did not allow unnecessary fat or safety margins. We pulled some back quite sharply. To my knowledge, we are meeting those targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several schemes will go on to a somewhat different basis. When all the integrated administration control system—IACS—forms are returned, they will form the basis on which the subsequent claims can be made. We shall then have a far more comprehensive database that will enable us to do things electronically and much more

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>263</span>
rapidly than hitherto. In a number of schemes there is some discretion over when farmers can submit their forms; they may be able to submit them within a certain period, up to a certain date. Several farmers are quite slow in delivering their forms. Even in the famous IACS exercise, a large number of farmers will deliver their forms on the last day, even though they may have completed them earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he had tabled a probing amendment. I acknowledge that we have experienced difficulties with certain schemes, for reasons which I outlined. Like all Government Departments, we occcasionally get things wrong, or things go astray. I cannot cite the circumstances of the gentleman to whom the hon. Member for Workington referred but I am perfectly willing to investigate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those observing our proceedings today will say, "Well, he moved his amendment and the Minister said a few nice things about what the Government are trying to do." But at the end of the day they want meat. Is the Minister aware of the number of cases that are over the three-month limit, to which the Secretary of State referred last October? How many applications have been received that have not been dealt with during that three-month period? Is there a monitoring arrangement, or merely general targets under the citizens charter? When accountants from the National Audit Office produce a report for the Public Accounts Committee, will the members of the PAC be able to ask, "What happened in those 573 cases? Why was the target of making payments within a period of three months not met after the Government had set it?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know how targets are being measured and what monitoring is carried out to ensure that they are being met. When, finally, the animal data centre's national statistical set-up can feed all the information to Government Departments, which can use it to check herd sizes and so on, will there be an arrangement in place to ensure that such delays do not occur in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can you answer that intervention, Minister?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best, Mr. Hill. We set targets and receive regular reports on how well we are doing. If we find a problem, we ask why it has occurred. At present, we are reviewing the whole question of payment delays, because we shall be making far more payments. Under the reformed scheme, many more payments will go directly to farmers. The cash flow implications of that are considerable. We shall be sending out many more application forms, so we are currently working on the methodology for dealing with that and, of course, it will be open to scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he is doing it because there are more payments to make. That is not the question that I asked. If the Government have an obligation to meet targets under the citizens charter, what mechanisms exist to ensure that they meet them? The Minister merely says that the Government have more cases to deal with and are therefor having to revamp their
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>264</span>
systems. Does the Minister know how many cases of payments delayed for longer than three months are outstanding this week, either nationally or for any part of the United Kingdom? Does he receive that information, or does he receive merely a statement saying, "We are having trouble with the hill livestock compensatory allowance payments and mistakes may have been made"? What is the nature of the information that the Minister is given? Is it statistical information concerning delayed payments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Two things happen. First, we receive regular reports on the rate at which payments are being made: the rate at which applications come in, the turn-around time and when payments go out. Secondly, when Ministers wish to receive specific information or to ask specific questions, the means for providing the answers is efficient and we receive them very quickly. For example, the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear that I know the daily totals of the IACS forms that come in. It would be surprising if I did not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot answer the hon. Gentleman's question about the three-month delay at present, but if I had known that he intended to ask it I could probably have ensured that I had the answer to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Okay. Then can I have an assurance that, if I table questions monthly about the number of persons who have made applications but have not been paid in a three-month period, I shall not be given the stock disproportionate cost answer? 	<i>Hansard</i> will show that the Minister would have been prepared to give us that information today. If I wanted regularly to monitor what is happening in the Department, surely that information could be provided, instead of having to listen to the disproportionate cost response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no idea what the rules are on disproportionate costs, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall try to provide the fullest possible information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the same thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There may be Government rules on disproportionate costs. I do not know whether that is so. If rules have been laid down by, for example, the Cabinet Office, Ministers must observe them. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to investigate his question and to write to him with the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to press the matter, but it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he must check whether Cabinet rules allow me to receive an answer in view of the problem of disproportionate costs. That is a cost factor. The reality is that if a structure is established, the cost of providing answers will fall in future. Answering my question may cost a fortune if the structure is not in place, and because of the disproportionate cost hurdle I would not receive an answer. However, if the structure exists in the Department to ensure that the information is made available—my argument is that there is an obligation to do so because of the commitment in the citizens charter—the cost will fall dramatically and Parliament could be informed without farmers having to write in. The matter is important and I am sorry if I am making a

meal of it, but the purpose of the Committee is to scrutinise legislation that is passing through the House and we are considering an amendment covering the payment of grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how to give the hon. Gentleman an answer that he will find satisfactory. I am not saying that I will not try to deliver the information that has asked for. I said that if I were to encounter guidelines, I would be advised to observe those guidelines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am telling the Minister in advance that the guidelines will provide a figure and his Department will say that it will cost too much to answer the question. Therefore, the Minister will have to give me a disproportionate cost answer. I am saying that the structure should be set up in the Department to ensure that the information is made available and the cost of providing answers will fall in future. That is a perfectly reasonable suggestion. The Minister need not go through the motions of asking the question, because I can tell him in advance that the system is not in place to provide the information and it will be too expensive to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that even if the cost of a reply were to be disproportionate, a Minister has discretion to answer the question. The hon. Gentleman's questions are usually so irresistible, that we want to be able to answer them. It would help if we could reach a compromise. Perhaps his question could refer to different regional offices. More people could then continue to pay claims and fewer would be required to work out how many claims were being paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help. The Minister has used the example of IACS, which is topical, as an example of the way in which the Minister can monitor day by day what is happening in the turnround of information coming in. Having given tantalising glimpses of his early morning briefing, perhaps he would tell us what today's figure looks like and what percentage of farmers he expects will have submitted appropriately completed forms by the deadline, which is now only four working days away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be in a position to give the hon.

I must draw the Minister's attention to the growing concern among wool producers about how the guaranteed price scheme is to be ended. This morning, I received an urgent fax from the chairman of the British Wool Federation, which reiterated the views of the federation and its members about the situation facing wool producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we all know, wool prices are very low indeed, due not only to the recession but to the build-up of the stockpile in the southern hemisphere. The current estimate is that there are 4 million bales of wool in Australia and, to a lesser extent, in New Zealand. I think that that information is common knowledge to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the guarantee ends, United Kingdom producers will be faced with a dramatic reduction in the wool cheque, which has, in recent years, formed a smaller proportion of the income of the hill farming community in particular, as well as that of lowland sheep farmers. Given that that sector of the agricultural community still faces difficult trading conditions, that reduction is a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The marketing board presents well-graded wool and provides for a smooth flow to auction throughout the year. The month-on-month change can cause as much instability to the market as the overall change. The board's
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0154">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>267</span>
statutory power to collect wool from 95,000 producers—that is still the figure—throughout the United Kingdom remains important, and the sudden ending of the guaranteed price, even after the warnings that we have had, is causing much concern, especially among hill farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past two months when the Bill has been discussed in this place, it has been common for those involved with wool throughout the United Kingdom to be anxious that efforts be made to improve the transitional position for the producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from Mr. Holdsworth, the chairman of the British Wool Federation, who says:
	<br><q><p>"It seems to me that the Board will have great difficulty in collecting from all producers in the UK and competing with private collectors taking the bigger clips. Already an advertisement has appeared, offering to buy the wool privately."</p></q>
He goes on to say:
	<br><q><p>"We agreed to the ending of the guaranteed price in 1988 but since"—</p></q>
then—
	<br><q><p>"the picture has changed dramatically (which could not possibly have been envisaged …). We are convinced that it is in the interests of both producers and the Wool Textile Industry to have the guaranteed price phased out over three years rather than ended so abruptly in these difficult circumstances."</p></q>
I submit that even when the Bill was considered in another place and while it is being considered here, the circumstances affecting the marketing of wool and the situation that now faces those dependent, to whatever extent, on their wool cheque, has changed dramatically. I hope that the Minister will not insist on pursuing the fast route at this intended speed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was the possibility of tabling and debating the order on the price guarantee at an early date on the Floor of the House. I understand that that is no longer the case. In responding to our comments, I wonder whether the Minister will be able to say what the timetable will be so that we know when we shall be able to have a fuller debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On this occasion I shall try not to act like a dog with a bone when I discuss the amendment. I had hoped that there would be agreement on both sides of the Committee. I understand that a number of Conservative Members have received correspondence from their constituents on these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go on about remuneration of sheep farmers, because that matter can be dealt with next week, or whenever we debate the issue. I received this morning a copy of the report by the Select Committee on Agriculture on hlca payments. I do not know whether the Minister has read the report. It raises some interesting points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to fall for that one. It would have been improper for me to have seen a copy of the report before it was published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can tell the Minister that it was available in the Vote Office at 8.30 this morning. I collected my copy at 9 o'clock. He could have read the report as I did. Not being a member of the Select
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>268</span>
Committee, I, too, do not have privileged access to the document.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Farmers Union strongly supports the amendment to put back the ending of the wool guarantee from 1993 to 1995. World market prices of wool collapsed in 1990, as the Minister knows. They remain at depressed levels with high world stocks of wool overhanging the market. The situation is similar to that of the potato market, which I mentioned the other day. We may be able to return to the matter of potatoes briefly today when we debate whether clauses 49 and 50 should stand part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1992–93 guaranteed price is 117p per kilo. The current market price of British wool is 46 per kilo. The National Farmers Union has said that ending the guaranteed price would halve the producers' returns from wool. It also says that it is considered unlikely that world stockpiles of wool will be substantially reduced before mid-1995 at the earliest. Given the extraordinary market situation and the implications for farmers' incomes of an early removal of the guarantee, the NFU—and the British wool marketing board—consider that the guarantee should be maintained for at least another two years. Ministers have rejected that proposition and we tabled our amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should consider what the British wool marketing board has done to try to resolve these difficulties in recent years. I understand that it has substantially reduced its marketing, grading, administration and promotion costs to slim itself down for the difficult conditions that it knew that it would face. It has reduced its work force by 30 per cent. and has reduced its depots from 29 to 22 over the past three years. I am told that, by earlier this year, it had generated a capital reserve of £10 million. I am also told that the board has widespread support throughout the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that in mind—and perhaps I may join with the hon. Member for North Cornwall in what he said—I, too, read with concern the report of an advertisement placed in the farming press, about which the Minister should be made aware. In effect, that advertisement challenges the whole future of the board and its operations. It states:
	<br><q><p>"No Guarantee Price for Wool in 1993."</p></q>
Underneath, it says:
	<br><q><p>"If you produce over 3 tons and are interested in selling direct to the trade please write with copy of your Grading Advice"</p></q>
to a given box number, somewhere in Kent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That advertisement, if successful, will undermine the historic collection of wool arrangements in the United Kingdom, developed by an organisation which has been responsible for grading, marketing and advisory services and has made a major contribution to wool marketing. Only in these difficult times, of this large international overhang in wool supply, is its role being challenged. I believe that it is wrong that people should be able to act in the market in that way and to undermine the credibility of that most important organisation. As the hon. Gentleman said, the effect of such actions will be to ensure that only the large wool producers survive—perhaps those in the lowlands. Meanwhile, the more marginal producers of wool will suffer various consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view and that of others, one of the first consequences of the changes proposed by the Government—and, indeed, of the operations of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>269</span>
companies such as the one which advertised and to which I have just referred—is that fewer sheep will be sheared. Last week, an interesting article on the front page of 	<i>Farming News</i> stated:
	<br><q><p>"Don't stop shearing warns Wool Board"</p></q>
The article said:
	<br><q><p>"The British Wool Marketing Board on Monday warned Britain's 100,000 sheep producers that the Government's decision to axe the guaranteed wool price was no excuse to stop shearing.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Wool returns next year would fail to cover shearing costs on some farms but the cost of not shearing could be tremendous, warned the board, listing poor fertility, increased death rates from rolling and intervention by animal welfare groups as inevitable consequences."</p></q>
Yesterday, I spoke to someone about whether that was likely to happen. Statistics, which I believe came from the British wool marketing board, show that, with the fall in price, it may now not be viable to shear on a cost per kilo. Let us consider the costs of shearing Swaledale, Dalesbred, Blackface Light Cast, Welsh Cast, Light Herdwick and Dark Herdwick sheep. Now, in terms of money per kilo, on a Dark Herdwick one would lose 26½p per kilo of wool shear, which is about 50p a sheep, and, on a Light Herdwick, 21½p per kilo. The profit on a Welsh Cast is only 20p for the whole animal; on a Blackface Light Cast, it is only 5p. Those are marginal amounts; they take no account of the cost of transporting the sheep to be sheared. Unless we are careful, many sheep will not be sheared, which will result in arguments with animal welfare groups about what has happened to the British sheep stock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, we took advice on the matter. We were told that failure to shear results in rolling—the sheep rolls onto its back and the heavy wool prevents it from righting itself, which leads to fermentation in the stomach and even to death. I am also informed that failure to shear can result in an infestation of blowfly. I am sure that Ministers know all about such matters; the question is whether they took them into account when they withdrew the guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Animal welfare is a more important argument than that about sheep farm incomes. Animal welfare really winds the public up. Last week, I was out in the Lake district near Buttermere. Looking over a wall, I saw two dead sheep lying in a field on the fellside. I do not know what happened in that case, but those are wounding sights for children, and even for me, as an adult. The sight and the smell in the air were quite appalling. There will be a higher incidence of that if the guarantee is withdrawn and it is no longer commercially viable to shear sheep.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many farmers who are conscious of animal welfare issues will want to shear their sheep—they will feel a responsibility to do it—but some farmers will not shear because it is not viable. I telephoned the agricultural development advisory service yesterday, which said that there would be a problem. If sheep are not sheared, ADAS, the animal welfare lobby, the wool marketing board and the farmers in my constituency all say that there will be a problem. What should the Government do if an animal welfare problem develops? In cases of blowfly infestation, the fly will land on a damp area of the sheep, either on the hind quarters or between the shoulders. It lays its eggs there and maggots are born, which then start eating away at the sheep. Many sheep die from such infestations. Surely the Government do not want to be held responsible for a policy that might lead to fewer sheep being sheared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told also of the problem of sheep overheating in hot weather. If they are not sheared, they can overheat
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>270</span>
and die from exhaustion. Problems of infertility can also arise; they were described to me but I thought it better not to relay them to the Committee—certainly not in public, because the stories are quite difficult to handle. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] It is a problem of infertility that can arise if sheep are not sheared.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The animal welfare aspects are important to groups outside the House. So, to, are the problems that might arise in the British wool industry. British wool manufacturers have exported British wool products under the label "British Wool". If there is a reduction in the availability of British wool because of a fall in the price, imports could be substituted. That would have implications for the export industry, which was worth £700 million last year—a substantial business. That will have consequences for employment in the wool towns of Yorkshire. I am told that scourers and combers are still employed there, working on raw wool from farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. R. J. Rhodes, financial director of the British Wool Marketing Board wrote to me in January with a proposition that I am sure was related to Ministers. He wrote:
	<br><q><p>"One possible solution which would limit Treasury expenditure would be for Government to pay the marketing costs of the Board for 1993/94 which will be no more than £12 million. This will allow producers to receive the full (but depressed) market value achieved at auction. As prices improve in 1994/95 and 1995/96 this figure could be reduced to £9 million and £6 million respectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the Board will remain a statutory board for the future, there are certain costs such as the transportation of wool from the remoter parts of Britain and the need to collect from every producer, regardless of clip size, and not just from those where it would be most profitable. Because of these commitments, it is imperative that there should be recognition by the Government, particularly whilst wool prices are in their current depressed state."</p></q>
Ministers today take the opportunity to respond to that proposition, which is at the heart of our amendment. We are not saying that there will not be room for the free market in the longer term, but while the international wool market is in crisis, why aggravate the position by doing a squalid, sordid little deal with the Treasury about some unrelated matter? That deal challenges a board whose usefulness over the years is recognised by everyone. Why not maintain the board through this difficult period, while there is a huge overhang in international markets? It should at least be enabled to survive until there is what I might term cyclical restoration of the international economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crisis in the international wool market is immense. According to a 	<i>Financial Times</i> article last week,
	<br><q><p>"The crisis in Australia's wool market deepened this week, with prices hitting a new low and the biggest overseas buyers starting to renege on earlier contracts … Brokers said that Chinese and Korean buyers, who were buying strongly earlier this week, yesterday kept away from the market.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Meanwhile, a delegation from the Australian Council of Wool Exporters had flown to China, the biggest importer of Australian wool, to try to persuade individual buyers to stop reneging on wool purchases contracted when prices were higher.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>Government officials say that the extent of losses from dishonored contracts is not known but the Chinese buyers' action is giving 'cause for concern' in the government. The Wool Export Council has asked the federal government to put pressure on the Chinese government."</p></q>
That is another indicator of the international problem of a collapse in prices. There may be a further collapse in United Kingdom prices. As prices go down as a result of international recession, major animal welfare problems
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>271</span>
may arise in the United Kingdom, especially if arrangements are not made to store wool for the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have raised most of the issues that I wanted to raise concerning the amendment. I hope that Ministers understand that now is not the time to pull the rug out from under an industry with problems. The message from Newbury is that, especially where large sums of public money are not involved, the Government should be more sensitive. A farmer, angry about what has happened, may well punish the Government by refusing to vote for them, because he or she believes the Government to be insensitive to what is happening in the marketplace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The price of lamb has risen nationally and in the European market. Ministers will recall that I spoke some weeks ago about these matters on the Floor of the House. Many of these problems can be dealt with in the marketplace. However, as the report of the Select Committee on Agriculture shows, although farm incomes have risen, they are still not at previous levels, and problems remain. I hope that Ministers will respond to that issue and deal in detail wih the matter of animal welfare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am flattered by the hon. Gentleman's concern for my majority and the lessons that he is drawing from Newbury. I shall certainly reflect on that when I consider my own circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment. Much of what has been said is not realistic. People talk about wool producers in Britain. I do not deny that a handful of farmers may be producing wool, but most are producing meat and wool is a by-product of that industry. It is about 5 per cent. of the return, so it is a tiny proportion of what farmers get from sheep production. Over the period of the guarantee, the strain of support has been taken by other elements, such as the sheep annual premium and the HLCAs. About £500 million is going to those farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1988, we took a decision in principle on wool. It is true that, at that time, the price was well above the average. The wool guarantee was intended as a price stabilisation measure, but it was never intended systematically to give producers more for wool than the market could justify. Of course, we must accept that matters may not be better in 1995.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a private company sets out to collect wool from farmers, other than under the authorisation of or by arrangement with the British Wool Marketing Board, it is breaking the law. That is one reason for keeping the statutory board. We believe that a body is needed to act as a buyer and to play the market, if I may use that expression. Therefore, we have kept the statutory functions of the board, unlike the other boards that we have been considering.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that there will be a response by the Government to the advertisement that was placed in the journal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why we need to respond to that. I am making a point which will no doubt become public, but I have not seen the advertisement to which the hon. Gentleman drew my attention. I shall be interested to see it. According to the terms that the hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>272</span>
read out, a company would be acting illegally, even under the reforms brought about by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made the clear statement that if the matter is as both the hon. Member for Workington and I have reported it to the Committee, it would be illegal. Who is responsible for taking action in those circumstances? Is it the board, the Minister, or some other body?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that the wool board has power, under the British wool marketing scheme, to recover from producers who contravene the statutory monopoly half the price of any wool sold in contravention of the scheme. There is a system of penalties on top of that. The responsibility lies with the board, which has the means to enforce its statutory powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is different from bringing action against the organisation which placed the advertisement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have to take advice on the extent to which the advertisement broke any law. If a company set out to buy directly from a farmer other than, perhaps, as an agent for the board—I am speculating—it would be breaking the law, following the enactment of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to follow the argument that farmers will not shear their sheep. I accept that some farmers breed sheep for wool, but most of them do not. It is in their interests that sheep should, first, be alive and, secondly, be healthy. That attracts a value premium of up to £30.55. Under the quota system which has been introduced in the sheep meat sector, it has a sale value as well. What incentive would a farmer have to treat a ewe, which represents a direct subsidy and a capital value, in such a way as to diminish that value? That does not flow logically from the concerns that have been articulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory powers of the board have been retained because there is no sensible business structure that could take over. As the hon. Member for North Cornwall will recognise, I have had many discussions with the board. It has moved quite a long way, but a management reorganisation scheme has been before it for some time. We have been urging it to try to implement that scheme. If I may say so, there has been a certain amount of woolly thinking in getting to grips with and grasping the nettle of that scheme, which would streamline management and make it more effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have met Mr. Holdsworth on two occassions. We have had discussions with the wool textile people. I do not accept that the consequences envisaged by them will come about. I understand the concerns. It is not surprising that the NFU would like to retain the guarantee because the NFU's job is to lobby for money, among other things. I am unable to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tyler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister legitimately used average figures and said that it amounts to only 5 per cent. of total farm income. It is important to recognise—this is reinforced by the Select Committee's report on the HLCAs—that for some farmers in less favoured areas the wool cheque can still be important. In the light of the muddle—that is how the Select Committee described the HLCAs—can the Minister assure us that in the calculation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>273</span>
of the future level of HLCAs, the reduction for such farmers in the return on wool will be taken into account? If the Minister tells us that those who earn a higher than average percentage of their farm income from wool—there must be quite a lot of them and they will be the people in the less favoured areas—will be compensated through other adjustments, the problem of the return to the farmer may not be as significant as some of us fear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that there should be a sort of differential payment on the HLCAs according to farm type, we might have some difficulty with that concept. I am not sure whether it would be legal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We base our HLCA decisions on farm income figures collected by agricultural colleges—not by the Government—that use a well-established methodology. The NFU does not challenge that methodology. In the past the methodology has yielded increases, as well as decisions to cut the allowance. I should be willing to ask the colleges to state what specific points they consider, if that would help the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment provides us with the opportunity to return briefly to potatoes. Some issues remain oustanding on which I tried to extract information from the Government last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with the potato guarantee in Great Britain. The guarantee is a sum of money which is paid by taxpayers to potato producers over and above the money that is paid by the Potato Marketing Board to producers in difficult years, such as the most recent ones. The Committee will recall that the first group of amendments that we discussed referred to the likely response of the British Government if the Council of Ministers did not make a decision. During our debates last week the Secretary of State suggested that the Government might in future want to take unilateral action. He did not quite say that, but that was the thrust of his comments. Ministers said that the potato marketing scheme in the United Kingdom restricts production but I believe that it would be possible to increase production if the processors went to the PMB and asked for that. They dominate it, so there is no reason why they should not be able to do so. If Ministers are going to take unilateral action, there must be a level playing field in Europe, despite what they said about the nature of the British scheme restricting production, unlike schemes in Europe which maintain and perhaps increase production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pressing the case because, having read every word of our proceedings, it is clear that Ministers remain under the misapprehension that abolition of the scheme will lead to a healthier market. My argument is that because of the variation in yield in the United Kingdom, which is the highest in the European Community, there is a greater likelihood of an overhang in some years because of increased yields per hectare. Those are the years in which dangers arise in the United Kingdom market. When arguing about the future of the scheme, Ministers do not fully consider the implications of the market when there is a glut of potatoes, because yields cannot be accurately calculated in advance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ainger</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend accept that the glut—especially in the new potato sector—has not been created by Britain alone? The problem is often caused by over-production in such countries as Cyprus, Morocco and Spain, and that directly affects the British market. The overhang is not just the creation of British potato production; it could be the creation of other countries' potato production as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There will be all sorts of reasons why there is a glut of potatoes on the British market. It might well be that the processors are not getting the specific potatoes that they want. As I have always said, I understand that the potato processors have a valid case. There may well be occasions when they cannot get the product that they need while they deploy their current production methods. Nevertheless, gluts exist at certain times in the British market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been critical of the potato marketing scheme, as the processors and the board know, but, over the years, it has been successful in dealing to some extent with the problem of excess—where there is a high yield in one year which might lead to an overhang in the market and a price collapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>275</span>
I am worried that the existence of subsidies in other European countries will distort the European market, in the event of the European Community not introducing a regime. The information that we have received during the past few days suggests that, despite the assurances that were given by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food last week, the European Community is not moving towards consensus—that there are deep divisions. I understand that Germany has changed its attitude to the negotiations, even during the past week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Admittedly, much of the information that one receives comes from that fine early morning programme which deals with farming. Perhaps that programme has journalists on the spot who are able to ask the very questions that we should have been considering last week. However, the information is coming in, and it suggests that there is not unanimity. There is a distinct possibility that there may not be a regime at the end of all this. Although I accept that there might be a perfectly reasonable explanation or justification for amending the scheme, I am not satisfied that its removal is in the best interests of British potato producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with a state subsidy, so I could not be more in order in considering again the comparative position. Last week, I drew the Committee's attention to questions that were being asked in the European Parliament by Mr. Peter Crampton. He asked Commission officials whether they would be prepared to publish the inventory of state aids.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food accuses me of conspiracy theories and plots, whenever he has the opportunity. I have to tell Conservative Members that that is the legacy of a period of campaigning about the security services in the mid-1980s, in which I was heavily engaged. I have never been able to shake off the reputation of looking for plots and conspiracies. However, I believe that the European Commission is refusing to publish information, that Ministers have had access to that information and that they have not given it to Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member --> 	<i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister shakes his head. If he has not had access to that information, I question his competence—in the nicest possible way. He could have had access to it. To return to the correspondence from which I quoted last week,
	<br><q><p>"Peter Crampton talked to European Commission officials yesterday in Brussels and he was told:</p></q>
	<br><q><p>—there is an inventory of state aids to the agricultural sector. After 1974 Member States (MS) agreed to send such details to the Commission".</p></q>
Therefore, we know that the Commission received the information. The message continued:
	<br><q><p>"—each MS gets a copy of the inventory every year".</p></q>
I presume that Britain is a member state of the European Community and, as such, is entitled to receive a copy of that inventory every year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The member states
	<br><q><p>"agreed that it was not for publication".</p></q>
I am able to deduce from that that the document on state aid was made available to member states and Ministers but, because Ministers had agreed that it should not be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>276</span>
available for publication, the Ministry is sitting on the document and not making it available to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The correspondence goes on to say:
	<br><q><p>"Peter Crampton's request was approximately the 160th request for information about the inventory, none of the requests to see the inventory have been granted".</p></q>
I have to say to my hon. Friends that I have been conned. Last week, I thought that I had managed the impossible. My hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Stevenson) received a reply to his correspondence with the Commission of the European Communities. Mr. Tung-Lat Margue, a member of the cabinet office of Mr. René Steichen, who is a friend of the Minister, said:
	<br><q><p>"Mr. Steichen asked me to answer, on his behalf, your letter of 30 April 1993 requesting information in relation to a specific state aid regime."</p></q>
I asked my hon. Friend for the inventory. He must have been the 159th person to apply for and not get the inventory. Mr. Margue went on to say:
	<br><q><p>"I can confirm that the Inventory of State Aids covers the Potato Marketing Regime in the United Kingdom by including the guarantees scheme for potatoes and the services provided by the Potato Marketing Board (U.K.). The details of these measures can be found in the annual report of the board."</p></q>
We were sent a document, entitled "Third Survey on State Aids in the European Community in the Manufacturing and Certain Other Sectors", which was published by the Commission of the European Communities. It has a publication code, which is ISBN 928264637/8. But that is not the right document. I want the document that Ministers agreed should not be published—the one that deals with state aid to potato producers and processors. I understand that British processors have been recipients of state aid which has been provided not by the European Community but by the national Governments of member states. As individual companies, those processors have received state aid. I want to see the document that details all state aid that has been paid to every producer, marketer or processor of potatoes, or in respect of property relating to potatoes, in the whole of the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ministers have come before the House and acted unilaterally to wind up the potato marketing scheme. They have not given an undertaking that state aid will be paid to British producers. I am opposed to that, but we are going down that route. We are not asking for abolition of the board and the scheme. I want it to be modified, but Ministers want to abolish it. We are entitled to know what the position is throughout the rest of the Community. We should not have to rely on this document, which makes vague references to potatoes. I know that there is other information available in the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), replied in January this year to a question asked by the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh). I quoted that answer in a previous sitting. The Minister said that the Government do not have the information available. The reality is that the British Government have access to it. If they do not have access to it, they should demand access. They have no right to wind up the British potato marketing scheme without knowing every subsidy that is available in every country within the European Community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
British producers cannot be placed at a competitive disadvantage. If the information were published
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>277</span>
Ministers would have great difficulty in winding up the scheme without introducing a subsidy regime for storage—such as the French have used—to deal with problems in the market when there are too many potatoes, and perhaps to provide protection against imports by putting a minimum price on them, as other countries are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that that should be done, but once we go down the route of refusing to accept that a compromise position might be available on a potato quota in the United Kingdom, reject all else and say that there must be a free market, we must inevitably accept that, to remain on the same level playing field as other countries in the European Community in the absence of a European regime, we will have to introduce into the United Kingdom the same measures that are available in the rest of the EC. If we do not, we shall place our people at a competitive disadvantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other day, the Secretary of State tried to answer those points by drawing a distinction between the arrangement in the United Kingdom and that in the rest of the Community. I have discussed those matters with people outside the Committee and they do not draw a distinction in the way that the Secretary of State did. He drew a very convenient distinction by saying that they were propping up production while we are restricting it. Ultimately, the effect is precisely the same—the objective of the various schemes is to ensure the survival of potato growers wherever they might be within the European Community. That is why subsidies, import controls and quotas are used. Different systems are employed to secure the same objective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been in this job for only six months and I am becoming increasingly a quota man. The Minister and I have discussed that in debates on other issues, because I believe that it is possible to run a free market within a quota system, depending on the extent to which one is prepared to play the game of brinkmanship with quota against prospective market demand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will feel free to discuss those matters without the Secretary of State breathing down his neck, but I persist in arguing the case for a level playing field in conditions where the Community does not take a decision. The Minister cannot guarantee us a European regime, but potato producers might be able to survive, even without a scheme. I do not know, but I think that they would still be endangered. On a level playing field in Europe where no state broke the rules with import controls, subsidies and so on, I believe that it would be best for the potato scheme to be retained in some form or other whatever the future conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other countries in the European Community recognise that the solution to their problem of how to avoid major public expenditure commitments might be to develop schemes similar to that which exists in the United Kingdom. If a compromise is sought in discussions in the Council of Ministers, it might be possible to avoid taxpayers having to pick up the bill at the end of the day. I am arguing for taxpayers and we do not want subsidies for potato producers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in favour of the clause because it would end the guarantee and the taxpayers' contribution. However, we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>278</span>
do not want that regime to be replaced by a system which, in effect, invites taxpayers to make contributions in future. That is the route that the Minister proposes because he is not prepared to accept that a compromise arrangement might be available which, to an extent, uses the existing potato marketing arrangements under a quota regime in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that because I have been in charge of the Bill, my visits to the Council of Ministers have been less frequent than normal. However, I have no reason to doubt the view given by my right hon. Friend last week that we still expect an agreement on potatoes as part of the price fixing. The European Parliament's view has been delivered and we are still steering towards a decision being made at the next Council of Ministers. If I find that that information needs updating, I shall let the Committee know, but my understanding is that the situation will not change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Questions were asked about the variation of yield in the United Kingdom. We have already seen that change. Britain has seen a concentration of production. Fewer people grow potatoes and production has migrated to land which is most suitable. That structural pattern is not likely to change greatly under a successor regime. We are talking about the removal of certain constraints and policing arrangements for a regime that is based upon quotas and a guaranteed price, which restricts entry into the scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Restricts entry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. One cannot simply go to the board and obtain a quota of 500 acres on the first application. The board ekes out its quotas. One can lease them or buy them. Entry into the scheme obviously has a cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we shall see more contracting. Processors often pay a premium price. It has been suggested that they are interested in a dumping price, but that is not so. They pay a premium for the quality of crop that they want. There are problems of storage and handling. Indeed, I have noticed that one processor—a favourite with the hon. Member for Workington because of the extraordinarily modest amount that it has paid to the Conservative party—has upgraded its offer of free loans to producers to put in grading storage and handling facilities, which have been a problem in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Workington will know that we import mainly early potatoes. They come from Cyprus, Egypt and other sources under special arrangement with the European Community; in that sense they are quota arrangements. We ourselves have intervened if those imports of early potatoes have failed to meet the conditions laid down. That is a precedent. Speaking from memory, I recall that we had to intervene in the importation of Egyptian potatoes because of problems with quality control. We were worried about the import of disease into the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for a level playing field, I responded to the hon. Gentleman's questions on potatoes at column 568 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> of 14 April. I answered those questions as well as I could, listing the aid available that was made public. Potatoes are not part of the Community regime. Where a regime is established as a Community regime, the information that can be given is rather greater than if it has not been brought under the aegis of a Europe-wide system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that member states provide information to the Commission on the basis that the aid paid to potato producers and processors remains confidential? Is the Minister aware that that is going on—yes or no?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That aid is given under regulation 86/6/93. We know our own figures; we do not know the figures of other member states. They have to be matched by national funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can talk of taking unilateral action, yet the Minister admits that he does not know what is being paid. How can Ministers possibly place British potato producers at that disadvantage? We do not know whether the Italians are paying £50 million, £80 million, or £200 million to potato producers. They might be paying £500 million to potato producers as far as we know. The Minister gave me some information in his reply, but I gave him a damn sight more information from my sources within the European Community. I had to ring my sister who lives in Montecatini, Florence, to find out what subsidy local potato producers in the hinterland behind Montecatini are receiving. What a nonsence it is that Ministers should talk about taking unilateral action without realising what is going on in the market. It is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have to bring a sense of reality to this matter. We have reservations about the scheme because we do not believe that it fulfils the national interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned producers, producers, producers and producers, and made fleeting references to processors. A whole industry is based on processing. Large volumes of imports are entering the United Kingdom—goods that we believe we could produce here. We are exporting acres; we are exporting jobs; we are exporting added value. We ought at least to see whether the scheme is partly responsible for that. We may conclude that the restrictions of the scheme have outgrown their usefulness and no longer permit the United Kingdom to develop agricultural production that is agronomically suitable, such as producing extremely good quality potatoes and specialising production. We are surely justified in demanding the right to review the scheme and take the action that we conclude to be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell-Savours</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misses my point. If he wants to go down that route, fair enough. That is his
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>280</span>
decision. We will oppose it and vote against it. Will we get the same treatment as the Italians, Germans, Danes, Dutch, French, Spanish and Portuguese? Will we have the same advantage as them in the marketplace, which is that, in conditions of an overhang of too many potatoes, the big bucket of the state moves in to bail them out with taxpayers' money? I am opposed to that, but Ministers must assure us that they are prepared to do that if they want to go down this unilateral route. The Minister talks about the national interest. Our national interest is to look after our own producers. They must be looked after; they must be able to compete on a level playing field. The Minister is failing to address that point. Will there be a level playing field? Under unilateral action, will we have all the stupid subsidies that the Europeans are currently being paid by their national governments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Curry</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman invites me to introduce a series of stupid subsidies. I do not think that I would get very far with that. A European scheme would give us the means to tackle the existing national subsidies. There is a point prior to that, which is to ensure that within existing powers we are delivering the structures that best serve the United Kingdom. That is at the heart of this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paddy Tipping 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sherwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister told us earlier that he is confident that discussions on a new lightweight potato regime will be resolved at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers. I remind him that those discussions are fairly long-standing. They were due to be resolved last autumn. Why have they dragged on? Why is the Minister convinced that the matter will be resolved at the next meeting?

The Minister talked at length—one could feel the strength of his conviction—about the notion of the national interest. We have argued before in Committee that the potato marketing scheme has served us well; it has served the national interest for 30 years. We are moving toward a free market. The Minister of State and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food told us in a previous sitting that they were keen that the market should operate. I am not against that, but I want a market that operates in the national interest. The point of this morning's debate is that subsidies are clearly being made in other member states.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
