	<section>
	<div class='title'>STATEMENT TO MEMBERS FOLLOWING ANNUAL RETURN</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 9, in page 12, line 2, leave out from "shall" to end of line 7 and insert "either—
	<ol>
	<li>take all reasonable steps to secure that, not later than the end of the period of eight weeks beginning with the day on which the annual return of the union is sent to the Certification Officer, every person who was a member of the union on that day receives a copy of the statement required by this section; or</li>
	<li>take all such other steps for notifying the contents of the statement to the members of the union (whether by publishing the statement or otherwise) as it is the practice of the union to take when matters of general interest to all its members need to be brought to their attention.".</li>
</ol></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 10, in page 12, line 7, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Any such copy or notification shall be accompanied by a statement that the union will, on request, supply any member of the union with a copy of the statement, either free of charge or on payments of such reasonable fee as may be specified in the notification.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In general, the Opposition support wholeheartedly the principle in clause 7 that unions
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
should be obliged to inform their members in detail of the unions financial position and the salaries of the president, the general secretary and members of the executive. There is no good reason why a union should keep that information secret. Indeed, the rules of most trade unions require them, in one way or another, to inform their members of the state of the union's finances, and many unions declare the salaries of the major officials. It is reasonable for the law to require all unions to meet the best practice of other unions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that the information cannot be kept secret. The amendments outline how that information could best be made available to union members at a not disproportionate cost to the union or its members and with the least bureaucracy. It might not be the Government's intention, but as drafted the clause is onerous and potentially very expensive, although one or two unions inform their members in the way set out by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 requires the union to inform its members of the financial state of the union and the salaries paid, but we hope that it will enable the union to do that in a way that is less onerous, less bureaucratic and less expensive. We hope that the wording of the amendment will commend it to the Minister—and, indeed, if I may refer to them, to his official advisers. The wording of paragraph (b) of the amendment is the same as that which the Committee has already endorsed in clause 5, page 7, line 20 of the Bill. It requires the union to inform its members either by sending them a statement, as the Government originally suggested, or by its usual practice of notifying members of matters of general interest—that is, via the union journal or circulars. If, as we agreed, that method of dishing out information is satisfactory in clause 5, it should satisfactorily meet the requirements of clause 7.I hope that the Government will accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10 makes it clear that when the union informs its members in the union journal or circulars, it should state also that full, or fuller, details of the statement of accounts are available to union members either free or at reasonable cost, by which I mean that members should, perhaps, be expected to pay the postage for receiving that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition hope that that achieves the Government's objectives, which, for the most part, we share. The amendment requires unions to publish and publicise that information. Imperfect though the wording may be, it permits anyone who wishes to know about the financial state of the union and the pay of the executive to do so. That information will be made public. It will not be possible to keep it secret. The amendment would enable members to have full information regarding matters, which, we believe, is the Government's objective. One or two minor consequential changes may have to be made to other parts of this or subsequent clauses to bring them into line with our suggestions. As ever, I plead guilty to the possibility of imperfect drafting in the amendment, but I suggest that there are also slight imperfections in the drafting of the Bill. The amendment proposes the use of the union's usual channels for communication with its members. If I may stray from the amendment for one moment, the wording of paragraph (b) in amendment No. 9 is similar to the wording of amendment No. 24.1 hope that the Government will accept the amendment, or will accept that something similar would fit the Bill, literally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the speech made by the hon. Member for Holbom and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 would allow a union to satisfy the requirements of new section 32A by taking the steps which are its normal practice,
	<br><blockquote><p>"When matters of general interest to all its members need to be brought to their attention."</p></blockquote>
Having listened to the arguments, I can tell the Committee that the Government are willing to consider the suggestion further, especially as the Opposition appear to have accepted the key principle that union members should have a right to relevant information. There are clear examples in the past where that has not happened—where it has proved difficult for union members to obtain what others now accept as a right to knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrangements for the provision of financial and other information to union members, on a regular basis, need to reflect the particular circumstances of the proposal. Therefore, they should not necessarily be precisely the same as those which apply to the provision of information about scrutiny reports on union elections and political fund ballots.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that union members should be able to have the information to be provided under new section 32A without undue delay, and within a certain period after the information is available to the union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that amendment No. 10 is designed to provide a necessary addition to protect members whose union chooses not to provide individual written statements to members as a matter of course. In such circumstances, I certainly agree that it is vital to give individual members a right to request, and obtain, an individual statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the terms of the amendment have drawn upon the legislation on the provision of the scrutineer's report on union election and political fund ballots. As I have already said, the arrangements established by the clause need to reflect the particular circumstances and needs which they address. As they stand, the provisions proposed by amendment No. 10 present a number of problems, none of which, I hope, will prove insuperable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that he did not expect us to accept his amendments. I shall explain why we cannot accept the amendments. First, they impose no duty on a union to supply a copy of the statement, on request, to a member. To satisfy the requirement of the amendment, a union would only have to indicate that it would supply the information, but would face no sanction if it failed to do so. I realise that that was not the intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment would allow a union to charge a member for indivual provision of the statement. The hon. Gentleman referred to that, but it is not acceptable—it is not part of the arrangements in new section 32A. We do not believe that a charge would be justified. Unlike a scrutineer's report, the financial statement is likely to be produced by the union itself, and is unlikely to be a lengthy document. We believe that it should be available to members free of charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the amendment fails to place a union under any particular obligation in terms of the time in which it
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
would have to provide material to any member who requested information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that those matters can be resolved when the Bill returns to the Floor of the House. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall endeavour to address some of his concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friends will join me in congratulating the hon. Gentleman on demonstrating so clearly that the law on trade union activities needs to be considered on its own merits, as we have done, and not by reference to wholly unwarranted analogies with company law. The amendments remove the requirement that trade unions should send to each member a copy of the statement. Companies have to send to each shareholder a copy of the annual report or summary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recognition of the Opposition's welcome conversion and of their arguments, we are prepared to table Government amendments to tackle the basic concerns which prompted the amendments. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendments. I assure him that changes will be made on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the question is put, That the amendment be withdrawn, may I refer to developments that were reported in the newspapers this morning relating to the nature of the return and the amount of information that is given to union members under the clause. It has been proposed that any member of a union who pays a political levy should be deemed to be an associated member of the Labour party. The issue of political levies is not in the Bill—and rightly so. I did not want to raise the subject today, but it is worth putting it on record that if the matter moves forward, many of us will wish to reconsider it on Report and may table amendments then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his response. As the Bill proceeds, we may all be inconsistent at times. I propose to be inconsistent in relation to comparisons between company law and the law applying to trade unions. However, I shall be no more inconsistent than the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's comment that our proposition provides no sanctions against a union which fails to supply the necessary information. That is clearly an imperfection. I recognise also that there must be a time limit within which a union must make the information available. Our main doubt about that time limit being a matter of weeks, as proposed in the clause, is that union members are usually informed by the circulation of a quarterly union journal. A time limit of eight weeks might require the issue of an extra journal. We accept that there should be a time limit, but it should fit in with the usual methods of communication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have raised a relevant point, but unions will know when their reports are expected to be available and will be able to publish their journals accordingly. I do not believe that the provision will be a problem for unions. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Conservative Members are elected to Parliament under the banner of the Conservative party,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
but other institutions in this country can lay claim to be conservative. Some trade unions fall into that category—with a small "c", of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of our amendment is that unions communicate with their members effectively. That may be through a monthly, bi-monthly or three-monthly journal. We are happy for a time limit to be set for the receipt and certification of the accounts and their onward transmission to members, but no one in the Committee wants to create daft difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's assurance that the Government will table amendments in the spirit of our amendments, with the addition of sanctions and a time limit. I beg to ask leave to withdraw both amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman can withdraw only one amendment because the other has not been moved. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 12, line 24, after "anything", insert "substantially".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 23 is a genuine probing amendment which we have introduced because we are not sure what the Government are trying to provide for or against in clause 7(3), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The requirement imposed by this section is not satisfied if the statement specifies anything inconsistent with the contents of the return."</p></blockquote>
It is not clear what potential for wickedness has been anticipated by those who drafted the Bill. If we are in favour of an information statement, it should not misrepresent the financial return that was made to the certification officer. I think that everyone would agree that, if we are in favour of the information being circulated, we must be in favour of it being accurate, not misrepresentative. However, we are not entirely clear about the aims of subsection(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the problems that could arise from that permanent spectre at the feast in all debates on trade union law—the dreaded vexatious, or potentially, vexatious litigant. Our understanding of the Bill as drafted, is that there is potential for the vexatious litigant to turn into a vexatious complainant to the certification officer when there is inconsistency between the statement and the return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our probing amendment aims to provide a waiver or saver whereby the statement must be "substantially" inconsistent with the return before there are grounds for complaint. Our provision would reduce the absolute aspect of the subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other problem we have with the subsection is that an inconsistency would amount to a criminal act. Most Conservative members of the Committee—perhaps not those in the legal profession—would agree that criminal proceedings should be commenced only if there are substantial reasons for doing so. As regards the stipulations of subsection(3), criminal proceedings should be commenced only if there is a substantial inconsistency. The concept of inconsistency as a criminal offence is fairly
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
novel in law. The Minister and I shall be bound to be found guilty of inconsistency before the hour is out. We need to be careful, therefore, before we make inconsistency a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no saver or reliever provision. If, therefore, "substantially" is not included, in comparison with company law it might be safer to provide a saver clause or subsection so that if a court were to find that a person who had introduced an inconsistency had acted reasonably and honestly, that person might be excused from penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without such a saver subsection in the clause and with the penalty clauses which follow it, there is all the more reason why any transgression on the grounds of inconsistency needs to be substantial, otherwise the might of the law may rain down on some hapless person who has circulated something only marginally inconsistent with the formal return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before any of my hon. Friends speak on this matter, we are interested to know what wickedness the Government think that they have spotted and are attempting to anticipate. I will not sit down until the Minister has his briefing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that the Minister is not receiving a briefing because there is no one to brief him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Right. They will not have a pay freeze either, will they? </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hartley Booth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Finchley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to consider the word "substantially". It is often said that the law is an ass, but, very often, it implies terms where it is perfectly obvious that other words should be included in the operation of a certain Act when it comes into force. Any court looking at the relevant section will not allow de minimis inconsistencies to apply. The concept of de minimis—in other words, too small to bother with—copes with the point of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. If the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras says that we have to have "substantially", it is nonsense. It is implied in the terms that can be read into the Bill by Her Majesty's judges when it comes to being interpreted by the court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The de minimus concept applies in the courts in respect of company law, by why are there savers to save company directors when they have acted reasonably and honestly but have still broken the law? Why is there a need for that provision in company law if there is to be no saver in trade union law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not considering directors of companies at the moment, but one has to rely on the judgment of the courts when they deal with company directors and trade unions. One relies on their commonsense and their ability to dismiss anything that is not substantial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the company directors point, one is dealing with a criminal offence where the liability is described in absolute terms. The saver clause ensures that, if a director has acted reasonably and honestly, he may be acquitted. I image
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras will agree with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One is dealing with a different procedure in a civil court. The remedy is to make a complaint to the certification officer or to the court. Section 55 of the substantive 1992 Act makes it clear that the certification officer has complete discretion whether to make a declaration. It is entirely up to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the procedure before the certification officer, if the trade union or the complainant is unhappy, the matter can be taken to court, and again the judge has complete discretion in the matter. Even if the judge decides to make a declaration, he has complete discretion whether to do anything else. He can decide to make an order that someone should abstain from such acts in future, or he can specify other steps. There is no true analogy between a criminal offence which would be absolute, except for the saver clause, and a civil complaint which has a very different remedy before the court and the certification officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By adding the word "substantial" to the amendment, one could make it more litigious than it needs be. If somebody complained that the requirement was not satisfied because of a minor inconsistency, the certification officer would almost certainly exercise his discretion in a sensible way and declare it to be a frivolous complaint. Even if that were not true of the certification officer, I guarantee that it would be true of the judge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friends the Members for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald) and for Finchley (Mr. Booth) who have given some of the assurances that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Trust of the judges has never reassured me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that there is no doubt that he will be inconsistent within the hour, and he has proved his inconsistency within 10 minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposed new section 32A requires a trade union to provide its members with a statement following its annual return to the independent certification officer. Subsection (3) provides that that requirement will not be satisfied if the statement specifies anything inconsistent with the contents of the return to the certification officer. That is to be welcomed.

If trade unions wished to impart different information to their members, it would be completely undesirable to make such an amendment. A trade union that has every intention of honestly informing its members about its financial affairs has nothing to fear from the provisions. Indeed, I should have thought that trade unions would welcome a provision which allows them—indeed, it encourages them—to use information already compiled for their annual return to the certification officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On property, which is of more concern, the report should be consistent with what has already been returned to the certification officer.

If the Minister fears that, does he not realise that the democratic procedures of trade unions require them to produce full and fairly audited accounts at their conferences, which are mostly annual, but, in some cases, bi-annual? Those reports always contain financial information that is more accurate than that which the Conservative party produces in its financial returns. Often, the Conservative party produces none at all and the Opposition have to scrabble around among the many bizarre organisations that collect money for it to discover how many millions of pounds have been put into its coffers by industry. Does the Minister not realise that the financial reports produced at union annual conferences, which are the supreme policy-making and guiding body of unions, are always accurate and publicly available to members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said that all reports are published, that unions are open and tell their members what is happening. I need refer only to the way in which the National Union of Mineworkers tried to block the publication of the Lightman report. Perhaps the hon. Member for Wallasey could use her influence to release and publish the Hand report, which was prepared for the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians. As tends to happen, information is leaked and the relevant leak appeared in 	<i>The Guardian</i>. It revealed the contents of that report in considerable detail.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Olner</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still confused about why the clause is necessary. I think that the Minister is also confused.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to be clear about that. We are considering financial facts relating to the return that has already been given to the certification officer. Everyone is agreed that that should be published and available. There should be no inconsistency in the two reports, but I do not believe that the court would convict on the basis of a spelling error. That point was adequately dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald) and my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley (Mr. Booth).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Hanson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Delyn)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's argument. According to the Minister, the court will not convict on a spelling mistake. Why introduce that element of doubt so that legal experts have to be consulted on what might merely be a simple error? The Minister mentioned that the unions were keeping back several reports. I should appreciate it if the Minister could urge his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to release the Boyd report. The Minister has already accepted that it is not just the unions who are inconsistent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not get involved in discussing reports which may contain details of financial competence. That is often the case with reports which bear directly on a company's financial position. That is not the point that we are discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Financial returns that are given by the union should be consistent with the statement that has already been submitted to the certification officer. I do not find a problem with that requirement. The amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hutton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely trying to understand the Minister's point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think "trying to make a speech" would be more appropriate, Mr. Knox.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no need for the amendment of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. Both sides of the Committee seem to agree that the information should be reported. Therefore, it should be consistent with the information that has already been returned to the certification officer. I should have thought that that move would have been welcomed by the trade unions and by the people who have to draw up reports, which are made available to their members for public scrutiny.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister have accepted the amendment had the word "materially" been used instead of'substantially"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am discussing the amendment as worded and not what might or might not have been on the Amendment Paper. There is no need for "substantially". Worries have been expressed about spelling mistakes leading to legal action. I do not think that the court would take action on such a mistake, as my hon. Friends the Member for Finchley and for Hertfordshire, North have already point out. Therefore I must ask the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras to withdraw the amendment. If he is not prepared to do so, I advise my hon. Friends to oppose it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still puzzled as to what wickedness the Government are trying to prevent. We need to be careful about the statement that goes out to the members if it is not going to be sent out individually but—as we proposed and the Government rightly accepted—through a union journal. It is understandable, therefore, that the Government want to ensure that the information in the statement—however it gets to the members—is consistent with the return to the certification officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is okay to use the word "consistent" in the Committee, but most union officials—who, like most company directors, are honest people trying to do an

<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government say that all the facts in the report to the certification officer must be included in the statement, that would be acceptable and would, we hope, achieve what the Government want. Perhaps an amendment outlining that could be tabled on Report. We do not understand what else concerns the Government. If the Minister helps us, we shall withdraw the amendment. As I often say, there might be substantial shortcomings in an amendment, even in one which consists of only one word, but if the substance is there, perhaps we can agree to a different wording. In this case, the amendment would have to meet the Government's concerns and not make hapless trade union officials wonder whether they were rendering themselves liable to criminal prosecution, de minimis or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall comment briefly on that point. What we are suggesting and saying is that the report should be consistent with the information which is returned to the certification officer. Some of that information may not be relevant to every member. It may deal with wider issues, not just financial matters. But the main financial record should be available to members. I do not believe that there is a great gulf between the Government and the Opposition. Therefore I do not believe that there is any need for a substantial amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a gulf of puzzlement between both sides of the Committee. The Opposition are puzzled about what the Government want to prevent. Whatever is in the statement should be in the return made to the certification officer. There is no sense in accepting the concept of the statement unless, in effect, the statement and the return are the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vague word "inconsistent" could make those people whose job it is to provide the statement fearful that they might innocently stumble into the position whereby they break the law, and they would not want to do that. As I said, most trade union officials, like most company directors, do not want to break the law but are fearful of it and would be bothered that they might get things wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are labouring the point. The clause outlines what should be in the return. The hon. Gentleman was concerned earlier about the costs. If he wants everything that is returned to the certification officer to be sent back to the unions, he might receive further representations from the unions about that not being helpful to their members. We are trying to help trade union members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not suggesting that a trade union report would have to be the same as a company report. As the hon. Gentleman probably knows, much of the information in company reports is not what people want. They want a digest of the facts and information, and that is why we believe that the report to union members should extract the most important factors and be consistent with that which has gone to the certification officer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rooney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in danger of having a drawn-out discussion on wording and its consequences. There is something potentially sinister and onerous about the use of the word "inconsistent". There is almost a double negative in the clause. Accepting that the clause is substantial, would not there have been some merit in having the clause state that the requirement is satisfied if the statement is consistent? By saying that the requirement is not satisfied if the statement is inconsistent, a minefield is opened. Does the Minister accept that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At some risk, I should like to refer the Government to the Renton committee on the preparation of legislation. One of its recommendations was that double negatives be removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members want to ensure that the facts that are taken from the return to the certification officer and conveyed to the membership are consistent with those conveyed in the report to the certification officer. It would be preposterous otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are happy to withdraw the amendment, but we hope that we can discuss the issue with the Government between now and when the Bill is considered on Report in order to thrash out an agreement which meets the requirement that members are told the same as the returning officer, but which does not raise the hairs on the necks of people with the task of doing that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are making laboured progress. From what the hon. Gentleman has just said, I do not think that there is much difference between us. Perhaps I have not effectively explained why we believe that the wording on the Bill is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras asked why each member could not receive what the certification officer receives in his report. The information that the union is required to give the certification officer must be considered. The hon. Gentleman might find that that information is more than is needed by the members. Therefore, I do not perceive a need to pursue that issue. I shall consider the hon. Gentleman's point, but I do not think that our views are too different—"consistent" and "inconsistent" could almost be the same words in some cases. If something is consistent, it is not inconsistent. That is by the by. I shall consider the comments of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras but I think that the wording in the Bill is sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the understanding that we are agreed that union members should receive an extract and not a variation of the information given to the returning officer, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 25, in page 13, line 26, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(8) Where a trade union has sent a statement or statements under subsections (6) or (7) above and the Certification Officer does not within 28 days notify the union that he wishes to make further inquiries, it shall be conclusively presumed that the trade union has complied with this section.".</p></blockquote>
This is another amendment relating to the circulation of information to trade union members. We are suggesting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
that there be a limit on the period in which unions can be found to be not supplying accurate information in whatever form it finally appears on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, the union could send the return to the certification officer and then, as required by clause 7, it could send him a copy of the extract or statement—the clause provides for a variety of statements—that will be sent to members. Union officials might believe that they had complied with the requirements, having sent the return to the certification officer and then to the members, but, at a much later stage—because there will be no time limit—they could be done for inconsistency. We suggest that the trade union should be able to send the statement or statements to the certification officer and, if he does not gibe within 21 days—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Booth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Within 28 days.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am sorry. If the certification officer did not gibe within 28 days, the union would know that it was in the clear, and union officials could sleep easily in their beds. If they were sleeping uneasily, it would not be due to worry about returns to certification officers and statements to members. Our amendment might not achieve a time limit on liability, but it is a small and helpful endeavour to make the law clear and to avoid people unknowingly falling foul of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The certification officer will receive the return and, if he receives the summary of the return, he can check whether the latter is accurate. That would not put an onerous duty on the certification officer and it would be helpful to the unions and ensure that the number of inconsistent statements was kept to a minimum. Our drafting of the amendment may be wrong—it usually is—but the principle is sound and we hope that the Minister will give it a friendly wave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment. It is very strange that the hon. Gentleman should suggest that, if an offence has been committed, it will fail to be an offence if it is not spotted within 28 days. Surely the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is not just the 28 days, but that the certification officer will have 28 days in which to check the statement's consistency with the return. He will be the only person in a position to do so. In 9,999 out of 10,000 cases, union officials will want to be consistent. They could refer to an arbiter—the certification officer—and if the arbiter does not find an inconsistency within 28 days, the unions should be covered. That would facilitate the process that the Government want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mere provision of a copy of the statement to the certification officer would not provide definite proof that all requirements had been satisfied. For example, it would still be possible that the union had not provided the information to all members who were entitled to receive it or had not provided the information within the required time limit. Such a failure may come to light some time after provision of a copy of the statement to the certification officer, but an offence would none the less have occurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does the Minister quibble with the time limit proposed in the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras? We may disagree on a time limit of 28 days, but surely there is no disagreement that a time limit should be imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Delyn will get used to referring to the Minister by the end of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The time limit within which proceedings must be brought for failure to satisfy the requirements under new section 32A is three years from the date of the offence, or within six months of the date on which the offence was committed, or within a year of the date on which evidence which in the opinion of the certification officer, or the procurator fiscal in Scotland, is sufficient to justify prosecution came to his notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a requirement had not been complied with, it would be wrong if prosecution could be avoided, merely because of the passage of time. Clause 9 specifies the time limits within which prosecutions must be brought for the offences that I have outlined. It would be wrong if such offences could not be prosecuted simply because, at some stage before the time limit for such prosecutions, the certification officer failed to make unspecified inquiries. The amendment could result in certification officers feeling compelled to make an inquiry to protect union members' rights and to ensure that prosecution would be possible if it was subsequently found that those rights had been denied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The certification officer may be put in the position of instituting a holding inquiry to protect his position under the time limit.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that employment legislation places strict time limits on employees, even in cases such as unfair dismissal when the time limit is only three months?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Somewhat reluctantly, Opposition Members of the Committee understand that the Government do not want the certification officer to be in the position of registering that everything is okay when it is not okay.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the certification officer is in a position to give a ruling on the accuracy or otherwise of the statement, then the unions are entitled to have it pretty smartly. If the certification officer says it is okay, they should not be subject to criminal action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to withdraw the amendment. However, we shall want to return to this question at a later stage. The certification officer has two or three functions. Our amendment may apply this time limit to all of them when it should apply to just one or two of the certification officer's functions in relation to the statements. With the agreement of the Committee, I am happy to withdraw the amendment, but we believe that, as drafted, the clause remains unsatisfactory from the point of view of trade union members and the aims of the Government.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 14, line 34, leave out "Certification Officer" and insert "Secretary of State".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This will be a good exercise in "slight inconsistency." Again, this is a probing amendment. May I make it clear at the outset that we have no objection to the proposition of a prosecuting officer with the correct powers taking action to protect the interests of trade union members and their funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question that arises is whether it is right that the certification officer should be the person to carry out this prosecuting and, to some extent, judgmental function. So far, the certification officer has acted as a regulator, monitor and administrator of matters to do with trade unions and has managed, through goodwill on the part of the certification officer's office and the goodwill of the trade unions with which certification officers have been dealing, to establish good relations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there may arise practical day-to-day problems if the regulator, monitor and administrator becomes a prosecuting officer and judge as well. Those functions do not normally lie easily together. The Government do not use this method in relation to companies. The Registrar of Companies is not charged with investigations. They are carried out by inspectors appointed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, to whom they report and who takes responsibility for their actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the amendment, we ask the Government to consider the possibility that the prosecuting and judgmental function envisaged here would best be carried out by Government-appointed inspectors rather than by
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
certification officers. Once in a while, I find that I am in agreement with Government lawyers. The concept of merging investigative and administrative powers raises a number of problems relating to natural justice. For example, there is, generally speaking, in our law a presumption against self-incrimination. A certification officer, going about his existing business, could be given information at the same time as he received a complaint that had to be investigated. He might be tempted to use the information that had been supplied to him for the purposes of his ordinary business as part of his investigation for prosecuting purposes. The problem that arises is whether somebody has self-incriminated himself by providing information to the right hand of the certification officer, carrying out his administrative functions, which puts him in trouble with his left hand when he carries out his prosecuting functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible for someone to use the concept of presumption against self-incrimination as a way of fending off prosecution. He may ask the court to rule that it was improper for the certification officer to use information, not acquired as a result of a specific investigation, for the purposes of that investigation. Opposition members of the Committee do not want that to happen. We do not suggest that someone should not have these powers. We believe that somebody should have this power and duty, but it would be better if they were separated, to ensure that there is no clash between natural justice and self-incrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The certification officer has carried out his functions fairly effectively to date, partly because of the general goodwill which he has managed to establish between the certification process and the trade unions. The proposal may raise questions of natural justice and the possibility of an appeal against any judgment, on the grounds of natural justice. It may also damage the day-to-day, up-to-date functioning of the certification officer. Administration, investigation and adjudication, all rolled into the office of one person, is a fairly unusual beast. We shall be interested in the Government's response to these points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome a number of the points that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has raised. He acknowledges the need for independence of a kind in these investigation matters. I am grateful that he accepted that this is an important part.

[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not heard the hon. Gentleman, or many of his hon. Friends, suggest that the Secretary of State, or any Secretary of State, should have more powers than they already have. In the past, Opposition Members have usually argued that the Secretaries of State have taken far too many powers unto themselves. Perhaps there is an inconsistency in the hon. Gentleman's argument, but as he said, we might all be guilty occasionally of inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1991 Green Paper cited the concerns expressed about the conduct of the financial affairs of the National Union of Mineworkers, and the sort of revelations which emerged from the Lightman report to support its proposals for new investigatory powers. Recent concerns about the conduct of affairs in the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians have added weight to the arguments—though the Hand report, which I mentioned
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
earlier, commissioned by that union has not, as far as I am aware, been published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the creation of the office of certification officer by the previous Labour Government, the officer has played a role in the enforcement of unions' duties in the conduct of particular aspects of their financial affairs. He receives unions' annual returns, accounts and copies of their rule books. He is also a natural point of contact for individual union members concerned about possible financial irregularities. The independent certification officer is well placed to decide whether to exercise those powers. He is much better placed to do that than my right honourable Friend the Secretary of State or, indeed, her officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's greatest concern was about the reputation of the certification officer and his staff. The new powers need not, in any way, damage the ability of the certification officer to fulfil the other important functions of his office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister believes that the certification officer, because of his detailed knowledge of trade unions, would be better placed than the Secretary of State to decide whether action should be taken, could not that logic be applied to the Registrar of Companies, who would be better placed to make similar decisions about companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is not much similarity between the certification officer and the Registrar of Companies. The certification officer has a judicial function in various trade union matters—political fund complaints, merger ballots and the statutory election requirements. The Registrar of Companies has no such functions. As I said earlier, we should get away from the analogy of company law and trade union law because the considerations are different. I thought that the Committee accepted that point earlier when I said that I accepted the principle of the earlier amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The certification officer hears complaints from union members about their union on a variety of matters. He is, and has always been, the enforcing authority who can prosecute unions for particular offences, and he has done so. None of those tasks has damaged his independence or jeopardised his reputation among trade unions. There is no reason to assume that new powers for the certification officer would be detrimental to his reputation, or to the ability of his office to perform its present functions. Indeed, I believe that there is every chance that they would enhance his reputation, not least among trade union members, to whom he would be able to offer significant assistance if they had justifiable concerns about the conduct of their union's financial affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are fortunate to have, in the certification officer, an independent authority who is both well-established and well-regarded. His office has contacts with, and knowledge of, the trade union world, which will enable him to exercise the proposed powers effectively and independently. He is best placed to exercise the proposed powers. The laudable concerns of the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras would not be justified. This is one of the few occasions when I shall be inconsistent by saying that that is not a job for the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You, Mr. Hogg, did not witness my earlier inconsistencies or, indeed, those of the Minister. Inconsistency is the buzz word of the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is some merit in the points made by the Minister. The certification officer and his staff have a good reputation. I would not deny that, in many circumstances, they would be well placed to carry out the proposed function, but the fact that they are well placed and good people does not necessarily mean that it is right that they should carry it out. The Government should give more weight to the problem of people putting themselves in double jeopardy and incriminating themselves because their prosecuting function could undermine their usual administrative function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of self-incrimination, perhaps not the vexatious litigant but the vexed defendant might tell the court, "I am being got at. I supplied the information that is the basis of this prosecution, and that information was obtained by the certification officer for other purposes. Therefore, I have incriminated myself and I am going to appeal." People may be able to do that, even if they have been involved in wrongdoing. We should give people as few opportunities as possible to escape the consequences of their wrongdoing by getting off on a point of law, especially the fundamental point relating to natural justice that might arise if the clause is agreed to unamended. The Government may live to regret introducing that combination of functions when challenges are made in the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not underestimate the extent to which the addition of the prosecuting function will make life more difficult for the certification officer and staff in carrying out their functions. Until now, none of their functions has been likely to put anyone behind bars, but to give that power to certification officers could be unhelpful to the day-to-day, smooth passage of information between the trade union and the certification officer. If someone is thieving the trade union's funds and, therefore, thieving members' contributions, he should be brought to book. The law is not satisfactory and needs to be tightened up. We support that principle. However, we do not want to provide people with a legal get-out, on grounds of natural justice. The best form of natural justice is to catch people who thieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition want the law to be strengthened to protect the funds of trade union members and honest union officials. We have severe doubts about the proposed combined role of the certification officer, which may undermine his usual functions and leave him and his staff open to challenge in court.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 27, in page 14, leave out line 35, and insert
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"more competent members of his staff or other competent persons as an inspector.".</p></blockquote>
We have just been praising the office of the certification officer so I hope that neither he nor his staff will be insulted by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The certification officer will be able to appoint any member of his staff or any outsider—even a convicted trade union funds fraudster—to investigate further complaints. That seems rather odd, so we are suggesting that the certification officer be required to appoint a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
competent member of staff or a competent outsider to perform that investigative role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a parallel in company law, under which inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry are required to be competent. From time to time, they may fall short of this laudable condition. Nevertheless, that is what the law requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The certification officer's office was established to run an administrative regime to register and check items, although not in a particularly aggressive or investigative manner. Generally speaking, the office is not concerned with pursuing issues relating to criminal law. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that most of the staff are capable of carrying out the tasks for which they were appointed, none of which is the task imposed by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be people in the certification officer's office who are not considered to be competent to carry out investigative functions. Similarly, outsiders who might not possess the necessary legal or general competence may be appointed. If the certification officer, lamentably, is to be given investigative powers, he should be under an obligation to take special care over which members of his staff are appointed to carry out investigative tasks. They are special and different tasks from those which have been carried out hitherto by the certification officer—and call for special talents and special competence. We believe strongly that there needs to be a special requirement of competence for such appointments. Special competence is required of DTI inspectors, so existing staff in the certification officer's office should have to display a particular competence, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As ever, our amendment might not entirely meet the Government's desire to have competent people doing the job. Allegations of fraud and villainy may, from time to time, need to be investigated. They should be investigated by the most competent people in order to catch those who are committing criminal offences by stealing trade union members' money and, for the sake of the trade unionists, to ensure that those who are not stealing the members' money are not bothered by unnecessary and incompetent investigations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The details of the amendment might not meet the Government's requirements. We should be happy to be upbraided about that and to accept a variation, but the point is that we want competent people to do the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern that those appointed to carry out an investigation into a trade union's financial affairs must be competent to do so. There is no doubt that that is necessary. If I may refer to what the hon. Gentleman said about the independence and reputation that the certification officer will have established, I do not think that he would want his independence and reputation to be jeopardised by appointing an incompetent person to investigate such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the provisions, as currently drafted, already address that point. Therefore, his amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 37B will give the certification officer the power to appoint one person or more to investigate a trade
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
union's financial affairs. That is an important provision, which is in line with what was said in the previous debate. The investigation would not need to be carried out by the certification officer, but he would have the power to appoint someone else to perform that duty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision gives the certification officer the discretion to decide whom to appoint to conduct such investigations. He is, therefore, already making a judgment about the appointed person's capacity to carry out the investigation. Gavin Lightman, for example, appointed people whom he felt were competent to assist him when he carried out his investigations for his report. He realised that, although he had the legal training, he did not necessarily have the financial training needed to carry out such a report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hanson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The phrase "other persons" is the one that most troubles Opposition members of the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has already said that "other persons" can have many meanings. Is there a clear definition? The amendment aims to build on a level of competence and a test of competence. "Other persons" could have a range of meanings. Could the Minister tell us what he thinks it means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to reassure the hon. Gentleman, but I think that the clause will give the certification officer the power to decide who would be best fitted to carry out that investigation. We all know that lawyers specialise on particular issues: the same applies to accounting officers and accountants. Some people may have more knowledge about dealing with trade union accounts than others. The certification officer may decide that such people would be, best able to carry out that aspect of the inquiry. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] Of course the certification officer will decide. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras and I have made the point about the reputation of the certification officer. It is unnecessary to question the certification officer's ability to decide such matters. The certification officer would be independent, but his activities would be funded by public money. He would therefore, be accountable in the normal way for his use of that money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the certification officer were knowingly to appoint an incompetent person to conduct an investigation, he would be acting improperly in the discharge of his duties. The normal sanctions against the misuse of public money would, therefore, apply. The threat of an investigation by the Public Accounts Committee would deter the certification officer from appointing someone whom he did not consider to be competent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have the normal rules, as well as the natural desire of the certification officer to ensure that he does not diminish his office by appointing a person who is incompetent to carry out the job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the arguments we have heard this morning, a double standard seems to be emerging. Trade unionists and trade union officials have to be bound by extremely detailed law because they allegedly cannot be trusted, yet everyone else can be trusted to use their discretion because they are sensible. Does the Minister admit that the vast majority of trade unionists are sensible and do not need to be tied hand and foot by such detailed legislation on their every move?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be a relevant contribution on Second Reading; it is not quite what the discussion is about at the moment. Indeed, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has gone some way to agreeing that the right course is to have someone appointed to investigate those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the hon. Lady might have great faith, some of the recent experiences in the light of the Lightman report and the Hand report for UCATT do not support her point. There is a need to have clearly defined roles for the certification officer and for the right of the certification officer to appoint people whom he feels are appropriate. There is very little difference between us on the fact that the certification officer should be able to appoint those people. I hope that what I have said about the way in which the certification officer makes appointments has gone some way to reassuring the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mutton</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to detain the Committee for very long on this point because there is not much difference between my hon. Friends and the Government. My hon. Friend, the Member for Wallasey made a substantial point to which the Minister did not respond very well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other parts of the Bill—for example, on the appointment of scrutineers—there is an attempt on the part of the Government to make comprehensive provision on who can act as a scrutineer. The responsibility for appointing an independent scrutineer is clearly placed on the trade union. However, when it comes to exercising the discretion to appoint scrutineers, the Bill makes it quite clear that only certain persons can be appointed. There is a complex list of organisations and individuals and the competence that they must be able to display.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing with the authority and responsibility of the certification officer, and the Minister is quite prepared to say that the certification officer can be trusted to discharge his responsibility without any heavy-handed interference in the Bill. Hon. Members will be prepared to accept that a certification officer would always try to exercise his powers responsibly and in a way that would best discharge his statutory responsibilities. That is not the issue. The point is whether it should be necessary to lay down a specification or broad restraints on who can act as an inspector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should recognise that those powers are quite formidable. In particular, the exercise of those powers could impede the respect and independence that trade union members might invest in the certification officer. Hon. Members will accept that the certification officer continues to enjoy the respect of the trade unions in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a risk—perhaps not a large one—that the power to appoint inspectors and persons who can require the production of documents and other evidence could be exercised in a way that would jeopardise the respect with which trade unions regard the certification officer. The amendment states that there is a need for inspectors to be competent. That is not something to which the Government would object. It is not a substantial impediment of the powers of appointment, but it would assure trade unions that those powerful inspectors are themselves independent and able to exercise their powers competently and properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>90</span>
The other point of principle raised by the amendment is that the certification officer enjoys respect. In order to preserve that respect, the statute that empowers the certification officer to act in certain ways must clearly state that his powers and responsibilities are subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a new Member of Parliament, I believe that it is an important part of our job to ensure that, when we confer powers and responsibilities on others to act on the authority of statutes, those statutes define the way in which those powers should be exercised. It is a fundamental feature of our parliamentary system of democracy that, when we confer powers on external and third-party agencies, Members of Parliament decide those powers. We should not say, as the Minister said, if I heard him correctly, that we can create a broad power and hope that the certification officer will exercise it in the way that the Minister envisaged. That will not sufficiently discharge our parliamentary responsibility. As lawmakers, it is important that we specify how those powers are to be exercised. Therefore, I support the amendment. It is important in practice and principle that the Bill should define and constrain those powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dobson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the certification officer and his folks are registering and carrying out their general administrative and monitoring tasks and that we are also giving them prosecuting powers because we think that they should be given to someone. The amendment attempts to jolt the certification officer and his staff into recognising that that is special and new—not that we are establishing a certification office special branch or an 007 licensed to investigate, but there is something different about the new function because it could result in the certification officer and his staff appearing as witnesses in court and other people going to prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to rely on the judgment and discretion of the certification officer. The amendment is necessary to give everyone the jolt that is required. We should rely on the discretion of the certification officer no more than we should rely on judges, as hon. and learned Government Members have been suggesting. Parliament should pass clear laws that reduce the discretion of people in power and keep as many matters out of the courts as is humanly possible. Our job is to make lawyers go broke by passing straightforward laws that anyone can understand and obey.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</ol></p></blockquote>
I should declare that I am a sponsored member of the Transport and General Workers Union, the union that I joined on the first day of my first job, which was in Transport House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras had been converted and that he did not want to compare trade unions with companies. The Minister obviously had his tongue firmly in his cheek, as he must have noticed that several amendments make that comparison. Amendment No. 28 is one of those. It is inspired by company legislation passed by the Government in 1985.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly inclined to compare trade unions with companies because I dealt in considerable—if not inordinate—detail with the companies legislation in 1989. It is reasonable to compare this legislation with previous legislation. Because the Bill is so keen to regulate trade unions, it is appropriate to consider the provisions applicable to other bodies and their officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 creates new offences for breaches of duties and increases the maximum penalties for certain offences which appear in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. The amendment permits the court to recognise that someone may have committed an offence but, if the court has regard to all the circumstances of the case and considers that the officer acted reasonably and honestly, the court can excuse the officer for the breach of duty, default or breach of trust and relieve him, wholly or partly, from his liability as it sees fit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Batiste</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matters that the hon. Lady is talking about strike chords of sympathy—nobody wants a person who acted fairly, reasonably and honestly to find themselves enmeshed in the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady's amendment refers to whether someone has acted "reasonably and honestly". I find it difficult to understand how a person can be said to be reasonable and honest if, for example, under subsection (8) they have acted fraudulently or, under subsection (9), they have done something which they know to be false in a material particular. How does the amendment add to the protections already built into the structure of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. Gentleman says. We are hoping to receive assurances from the Minister that
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
minor breaches will not be over-penalised. Earlier, we were considering issues such as spelling mistakes, and many hon. Members were entirely reassured by the Minister's reply. In common with the Minister, I have a surname that is constantly misspelt, so I feel particularly strongly about that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that the punishment fits the crime, but under the clause the punishment could be far in excess of that. The purpose of the amendment is to probe the Government's thinking and to consider the types of offences and breaches in more detail. There is a great variety of offences, and something that may appear to have been fraudulent might have occurred with no intention to defraud and might have a reasonable explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras and other hon. Friends are worried that trade unions are being treated disproportionately and more severely. There is a low incidence of improper behaviour by trade unions. My hon. Friends might refer to that matter in more detail because they have great experience of the way in which unions conduct their affairs. Union members have better and easier access to their union leadership than do shareholders when trying to find out about the activities of their directors and board members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that a defence of reasonableness is available, and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) has referred to some important comparisons. The Committee will agree that fraud and deception should be dealt with appropriately. My hon. Friend referred to company and City matters. All hon. Members have received letters from constituents complaining about members of the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation, the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Organisation and other regulatory bodies. We have all received letters about home income bond schemes by which people have been defrauded. The ordinary person often cannot understand the details of such fraud which might be complex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The incidence of trade unions misusing members' money is very low but it is taken very seriously. Such misuse falls into different categories—for example, defalcation. I was involved in a case in which the police had to chase someone across Europe and north Africa to regain money that properly belonged to a trade union. There may be deliberate misuse of money when people use it for purposes that are not defined in the rules. Unintentional misuse also occurs. On several occasions, I have had to deal with cases in which a union branch had made a donation to an appeal and the donation had mistakenly been beyond the limits prescribed by the rules. Incompetence might occur when someone acts in good faith but makes a genuine mistake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such matters may be covered up by accounting procedures. None of us would want fraud or other irregularities to be covered up and hidden in documentation. In reality, when an irregularity is uncovered by a union, members deal with it most severely. It is important, however, to keep such matters in perspective. They might concern not only the ruling national council, or senior national officials, but an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>93</span>
inexperienced shop steward or an individual branch official, who is not trained in accounts and makes a genuine mistake which is recorded in the ledger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The legislation should distinguish between the deliberate act of fraud—such as home income bonds—and the minor misuse of moneys. A person might believe the promotion of a certain cause to be a genuine and proper use of money. They might enter the expenditure into the accounts only to find out that under the law and rules that govern the union, that is not the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Heald</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are there any cases when a union official could have acted reasonably and honestly and yet be liable? In almost every instance where an offence is dealt with or explained in clause 9 there is a defence. For example, regarding the falsification of a document it is a defence to prove that an official had
	<br><blockquote><p>"no intention to conceal the financial affairs of the trade union or to defeat the law."</p></blockquote>
An accident, such as the one described by the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston, would not be regarded as the kind of offence for which an official would be liable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Miller</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that the Government cannot provide examples illustrates my point that such incidents rarely happen. It is important to keep in perspective the rare occasion when an accident happens. When a branch decides to make a donation that turns out to be against the rules, that mistake should be regarded as a minor, technical breach. The issue must be handled appropriately with regard to the law. Therefore I support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example of a court using its discretion in such a matter. The prosecution brought by the independent certification officer against Arthur Scargill last year was dismissed by the Sheffield magistrates. In announcing his decision not to appeal against that decision, the certificiation officer made it clear that he believed that the prosecution had been brought properly
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
and should have been brought. We can see the courts using their discretion quite properly in cases. The amendment should not therefore be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions of clause 9 will lead to increased penalties for relevant offences and make a new offence of obstructing the investigation of a trade union's financial affairs. That is as it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions should be welcomed as making the certification officer more effective in deterring malpractice in the conduct of trade union financial affairs. Certainly it will make him more effective than he has been in the past and than he is at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, clause 9 will help the certification officer in his enforcement role, by providing him with more time to bring proceedings than is currently available to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to support the amendment, whose drafting shows much common sense. The Minister is aware that most trade union officials are not paid officials. Most branch officials are volunteers. They are ordinary men and women who volunteered to be tellers, treasurers and membership secretaries for their unions and to do all the dogsbody work that makes a union great.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Minister is not suggesting that these folk must be Philadelphia lawyers and understand everything the Government are trying to do? It is common sense to keep an organisation like a trade union democratic. We must retain the common sense principle that many unions have admirably followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment uses the words "reasonably and honestly". Let me give an example. I have worked with branch officials and secretaries who have been in the business for many years and who do their best. Suddenly one of them receives a letter. Will they punish somebody like old Jock McTavish and throw the weight of the court at him when a registration officer, or a certification officer, or one of his staff goes to his office to demand all his books and he wants to check with his full-time official that that officer has a right to the books? He will probably break the law by refusing to hand over his books to the certification officer. That individual will not necessarily be a Philadelphia lawyer, or a back-street lawyer. He will have to phone his full-time officer for clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is very reasonable. I have had no academic training, but I have supported and worked with trade unions. In the interests of democracy, I believe in the right to decent ballot votes and the right to have our finances scrutinised. I do not want to see trade union officials driving about in Rolls-Royces swigging champagne at the expense of a guy in a factory or down a mine. However, we could reach the nonsense situation in which the provision drives us away from the essential trade union position of involving people at branch level. The clause could prevent thousands of volunteers from playing an active, democratic role because they might be frightened of the big judge and the sheriff who do not care about our unions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Gateshead, East said in her opening remarks that she regarded the amendment to be, in some respects, probing. She also wanted clarification of the Government's intentions regarding the amendment. The hon. Member for

	<span class='label label-info column'>95</span>
Ellesmere Port and Neston made some of the same points as the hon. Lady. My hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North addressed those points by referring to the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point also addressed those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Renfrew, West and Inverclyde (Mr. Graham) raised an issue which I shall try to clarify. Earlier this morning, the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that there could be many inconsistencies during today's debate. Perhaps I shall be inconsistent now by saying that when the previous Labour Government enacted the provisions about the offences which are to be found in section 45 of the 1992 Act—a consolidating Act—they saw no need for such an amendment. In that respect—if not necessarily in any other—my inconsistency is to agree with the Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would only confuse and distort the intended and proper operation of the law. If a court found that a union officer or official had committed a section 45 offence, it would have to consider further issues about that person's motivation. However, offences in subsections (1) and (4) of section 45 refer to motivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Offences in section 45(1) relate to circumstances in which a union "refuses or wilfully neglects" to perform certain duties. Similarly, section 45(4) offences refer to a person who "wilfully altering" a document with "intent to falsify". New subsection (10)(a) would do nothing other than distort the intended effects of the law and set the courts an impossible job. It would require them to consider any plea of mitigation based on the proposition that the person concerned none the less acted "reasonably and honestly".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new offences, which would be added to section 45 by clause 8, already contain the appropriate protections to ensure that individuals should not be prosecuted where that should not happen. I refer hon. Members to two provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, new subsection (b) of section 45 of the 1992 Act provides that it is a defence against charges of contravention of requirements which would be imposed by new sections 37a(3) and 37b(4) for a person to prove that relevant documents were not in his possession and that it was not reasonably practicable for him to comply. Secondly, new subsection (7) of section 45, the 1992 Act provides that it is a defence for an official or agent of a union charged with destruction of relevant documents to prove that
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"he had no intention to conceal the financial affairs of the trade union, or to defeat the law".</p></blockquote>
Similarly, if the question at issue is the position of an individual who is charged under section 42(2), section 45(3) provides that
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any proceedings brought against an officer or member by virtue of subsection (2) in respect of breach of duty, it is a defence for him to prove that he had reasonable cause to believe, and did believe, that some other person who was competent to discharge that duty was authorised to discharge it instead of him and had discharged it or would do so."</p></blockquote>
I realise that the hon. Member for Gateshead, East may wish to study what I have said in 	<i>Hansard</i> because some of the points about the implication of the law are technical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add, if only for the record, that section 45 offences are all summary offences, and that the question of trial by judge and jury would never arise. Accordingly,
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
the provisions of proposed new subsection (l0)(b) of the 1992 Act may be based on a technical misunderstanding about that aspect of the law. So I ask the hon. Lady to withdraw her amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting, if short, debate on amendment No. 28. My hon. Friends have made some important points. However, in his contribution, the hon. Member for Castle Point cast a grotesque slur on parliamentarians by saying that we should not worry about the punishment fitting the crime. That seems to be a complete abdication of our duty as legislators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that we may wish to study his remarks in 	<i>Hansard</i>. We shall certainly do that because we are still worried that the treatment meted out under the provisions of the clause may be unduly harsh. However, we accept that the Minister has clarified the matter in more detail. We shall study his remarks and, possibly, pursue the matter further at a later stage if we think it appropriate. In the meantime, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) the court shall on conviction under section 45, specify whether the offence does or does not merit a disqualification and, if it does, what period it should be within these periods.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments do not interfere with the powers of the court to find offenders guilty, but they give the court greater discretion, particularly in deciding whether an offence is sufficiently serious to warrant disqualification from office. The clause makes disqualification mandatory and imposes periods for disqualification from office that are severe compared with, for example, the provisions of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986—an Act passed by the Government. Therefore, the amendment allows greater discretion over periods of disqualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right that deliberate and flagrant law-breaking should be punished and that breaches of trust should lead to disqualification. I would not want the Minister to think that any of my remarks detract from that. None the less, I am worried about the lack of discretion and the harsh regime introduced by the clause. We have already discussed offences that are subject to fines. Will the Minister say whether fines will still be imposed, or whether they have, in effect, been abolished and replaced by the clause?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition maintain that fraud on that scale is extremely rare in the trade union movement. In saying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
that, I echo the words of some of my hon. Friends who spoke during the debate on previous amendments. I am also worried about the liability of a group of officers who may be caught by the wording of the clause. I am concerned that if, for example, two out of five officers did not know that an offence was being committed, the clause would not deal properly with the defence that they acted in good faith, which seems rather harsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make no apologies for returning to the point about the punishment fitting the crime, nor for returning to the point about the harsh way in which unions are treated, compared with companies. Because of the nature of trade unions, small sums might be involved. While I would not condone anything on the basis of how small or large the sums might be, we know that, in the case of companies, large sums of money have been involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want there to be a great discrepancy between the deterrents for unions and those for companies so that huge sentences are considered appropriate to deter trade unions but lighter sentences are deemed sufficient to deter companies. I remember during the proceedings on the Bill that passed into law as the Companies Act 1989, many Tory Members constantly preached the virtues of self-regulation for companies. They are not, however, preaching the virtues of self-regulation for trade unions. That is why I make no apology for comparing the two and worrying about the different ways in which each is treated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Democratic structures are at the heart of the trade union movement. Whatever the law may be, it will be exceedingly difficult for an errant branch secretary who has run off with the funds—a far more regular fraudulent activity than more sinister occurrences—to be elected to the executive. The members whose funds have been taken in that way tend to want capital punishment— [	<i>Laughter.</i>]—preferably by the slowest, most awful method available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady would like to table an amendment on that subject, I am sure that it would cause us to have a wide-ranging debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Eagle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should realise that I am much more humane than that and have long opposed capital punishment. Our legislative duty on such occasions is to keep back from the mob and to maintain a sense of balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are already internal checks and balances in place which work extremely well. The Government have come up with very few examples of fraudulent behaviour. They keep referring to same examples, some of which have taken place at times of extreme industrial disruption and could not, therefore, be regarded as normal behaviour, even though we should not condone such examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those checks and balances ensure that anyone involved in such dubious activity is highly unlikely, with or without
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
the intervention of the courts, ever again to hold a position of responsibility or respect in that particular trade union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the points made by the hon. Lady bears out the reason why she should not get too worked up about this issue. She said that there are very few examples. If that is the case, the matter that causes her concern will not arise on many occasions. Therefore it is right for a penalty of disqualification to exist. The amendments are unacceptable, as they would produce an unworkable and inappropriate system for the application of disqualification from union office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conviction for a section 45 offence is a matter for the criminal law courts, specifically magistrates' courts in England and Wales. Those courts are properly equipped to deal with prosecutions for such offences and to determine when they have been committed. They are not at all equipped to make decisions about when it is appropriate to disqualify a person from holding union office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be fundamentally inconsistent with the present law on election to union office to suggest that any court should be able, on its own initiative, to impose disqualification from union office. Under the present law, it is for members to bring complaints to the courts if they believe that their union has breached its duties in respect of election to union office. The provisions of clause 10 are consistent with that principle; those in the amendments are not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of fixed periods of five and 10 years for disqualification, as opposed to the variable system envisaged by the amendments, has three important advantages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that the Minister is unhappy about the fact that too much reference is being made to the law affecting companies. I hope that he will forgive me if I press him one more time: the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986 provides more discretion to the courts as to how far they can go in imposing such penalties, and as to whether they can impose full penalties or lesser ones. That is written into the legislation. Can the Minister explain why, if that is okay for matters of fraud relating to company directors, it is not okay for cases of suspected fraud in relation to trade unions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I might be taking the Committee down a path which we are not here to discuss if I answer that question. We are discussing the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fixed periods of five and 10 years achieve three aims: first, they distinguish between the gravity of the offences which result in disqualification from office; secondly, they relate the disqualification period to the statutory election requirements—the latter provides for election to union office at intervals no greater than five years; and, thirdly, they avoid the need for a court to address the question of what period of disqualification is appropriate in any given set of circumstances. That, in turn, will also give a member contemplating such proceedings greater assurance as to the nature of their outcome. Therefore, it is important that the system should remain. We reject the amendments and I urge my hon. Friends to vote against them, if they are pressed to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
