	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>CARDIFF BAY BARRAGE BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales (Mr. Gwilym Jones)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That, during proceedings on the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></blockquote>
I hope that we shall give the Bill the consideration that it warrants, that we shall proceed amicably and that we shall not need to extend our sittings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Torfaen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Winterton, to an exclusively Welsh Standing Committee. I am sure that you will enjoy our deliberations. You are, of course, aware not just of the history of the Bill and its passage through the House, but of the fact that Opposition Members regard the setting up of this Standing Committee as an error. We believe that Standing Order No. 86 would have given all hon. Members representing Wales the opportunity to discuss the matters with which we shall be dealing. I am only sorry that that has not been the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite convinced, however, that hon. Members from Wales—and, indeed, from England—will consider fully the matters we are to discuss. I agree with what the Minister in his comments about the sittings motion. However, I should like to make a few points which I am sure that the Minister will take on board in our various sittings. This is the first occasion on which a Standing Committee has dealt with the details of the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill. Select Committees have dealt with the Bill extensively, but this is the first occasion on which Members of Parliament have been given the opportunity to examine the Bill line by line. The major difference between what occurred in March before the general election—when the Standing Committee met for only half an hour and had to be abandoned because of disputes over Standing Order No. 86—and now is that at that time the Government had a majority of 100 and they now have a majority of 21. The difference between those two figures must mean that the arrogance demonstrated by the previous Conservative Government—not just to this Bill but to various others—cannot continue. The Government must make various concessions and compromises and listen to what the Opposition have to say. I hope that, in the sittings ahead, the Government will not just mechanically say, "No" to anything that the Opposition proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has aroused enormous controversy. There are those who, quite rightly from their point of view, believe that the establishment of a Cardiff bay barrage would benefit that city, and south Wales in general. They believe that the barrage would bring economic development and, without it, great doubts could be cast over the attractiveness of development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are others, who are equally genuine, who believe that the building of the barrage would present many problems. It is only in Standing Committee that we can consider all those different points of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
I do not propose to go into the pros and cons of the general principles behind the Bill because, Mr. Winterton, you would not allow me to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that we have to ensure that our sittings are set out in such a way that we can look at the various problems, one by one, as the days go by. The first problem—which I think will be dealt with this morning and during the rest of the week—concerns the cost of the project. There will, I am sure, be lively exchanges between the Minister and the Opposition on why the cost has increased, from about £80 million to £112 million, which is an increase well above the rate of inflation. I know that the Minister will have answers to that point, but I think that the general philosophy behind the costing of the Cardiff bay is of great concern to many hon. Members. The total cost of the Cardiff bay barrage—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman refrain from going into the broad purposes of the Bill and direct his remarks to the sittings motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that sufficient time will be set aside by the Committee to consider the costs. I know that that matter will be dealt with in some detail later on today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another sitting should be devoted to a debate on the water quality of the bay, which concerns many environmentalists and many people in Cardiff. Another sitting should be set aside to enable the Committee to deal with the ground water levels in Cardiff. We should be able to discuss in considerable detail the fears of the residents of Cardiff about the problem of ground water levels and the possibilities of flooding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally important that a sitting be devoted to relations with local authorities in Cardiff. Both South Glamorgan county council and Cardiff city council have a considerable interest in what goes on in Cardiff bay. We believe—as we will set out in detail—that there is room for improvement in the Bill to develop relationships between the Cardiff Bay development corporation, which is responsible for building the barrage, and the directly-elected local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that another sitting will be devoted to the general environmental matters surrounding the building of the barrage. The Minister has a good record on wanting to aid and protect the environment surrounding the barrage, particularly the bird population, which migrate through or live in Cardiff bay. The Committee will also consider the recommendations of the Select Committee, some of which are less than acceptable to the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most important aspect of the Bill, and one that the Standing Committee will consider, is the growth and development of the capital city of Wales. There are serious disagreements among many hon. Members on how that should take place, but there is no disagreement that the general area of Cardiff bay should be developed. I hope that we will go through the details of the Bill in a spirit that recognises that the south of Cardiff must be developed. There must be economic regeneration, there must be more jobs, and there must be an end to the dereliction in south Cardiff. That must be done, but not at any price. That is why it is so important that the Standing Committee should consider the Bill in detail. We will look, line by line, at the points that affect not only the capital city of Wales, but the entire Principality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ted Rowlands 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I question whether we should support the sittings motion. I shall not support it unless we get clear-cut assurances from the Minister about information that is required to make the Committee's work effective. We all get our parliamentary kicks in one way or another. This Committee is odd, if not unique, in post-1940 parliamentary activity. The Committee is considering a Bill that started as a private Bill and was converted by the Government into a public Bill, for which there are no known precedents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been through the Journal Office, the Public Bill Office and the Private Bill Office and I have not found a precedent for a Bill being treated in this way since 1940. The Committee is making history and some procedural issues flow from that. That is why I asked a question during the debate on setting up the Committee and why we felt so strongly about the character, nature and composition of the Committee. Even at this late stage, I hope to appeal to the nicer side of the Under-Secretary, who has not been in office long enough to become a ministerial cynic, and suggest that he considers varying the Committee's composition as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary refused to give all Members representing Wales the opportunity to serve on the Committee on curious grounds. He referred to a suggestion made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Swansea West (Mr. Williams) for a larger Committee of some 80 Members or more. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman is correct, but I doubt whether there is any precedent for doing it."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 9 June 1992; Vol. 209, c. 272.]</p></blockquote>
The original Standing Orders that established the principle of Standing Committees such as this, intended Standing Committees to be large because the House was rightly jealous of transferring power from the Committee of the whole House to a smaller Committee. The Standing Orders envisaged Committees of 80 or more members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were not asking for something odd or strange. The strangeness has been the gradual whittling down of the size of Committees. We have a stronge case—and I appeal to the Under-Secretary to think again—for suggesting, in the light of the unique character of the Committee's work, that it should be larger. Even if he is not willing to reconsider the size of the Committee, will he consider sympathetically an alternative proposition? The Standing Committees on Statutory Instruments &c. and the European Standing Committees have a helpful and sensible procedural arrangement. Hon. Members who are not members of those Committees can attend them and speak, but not vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Under-Secretary reflect on the possibility of reconsidering the composition of the Committee, given its curious, unique character and at least consider my suggestion that the Committee consist of the selected Members, but that hon. Members with particular interests in the Bill be allowed to speak. That would be a reasonable procedural compromise and I hope that the Under-Secretary will consider this helpful suggestion. There are hon. Members who are not members of the Committee but who have a special interest in the Bill with its curious and unprecedented history.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that the House would have to make an order for that to happen. It is not for the Minister to make such a decision. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is aware of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am perfectly aware that it is for the House to decide, but we are all aware that the House may well agree to whatever the Government decide. If Ministers decide to revise the composition of the Committee along the lines and in the character that I have suggested, I have a sneaking suspicion that the House might support that decision. All that I am asking is that the Minister sympathetically consider my sensible proposal so that hon. Members who have not been selected to the Committee but who have considerable knowledge of the issues are able to attend. I am thinking in particular of my hon. Friend for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) who is probably one of the top experts in the House on the wildlife issues arising in the Bill. He will be deprived of the opportunity to discuss those matters in detail. Therefore, I think that he, and others, should have the right to attend the Committee and to speak, even if they cannot vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other matters that need to be cleared up before we can support the sittings motion, all of which relate to the evidence and information before the Committee which, in my experience, are central to any sittings motion. First, I note with some alarm that there are no available copies of the original private Bill. That is absurd and silly, given that every clause in the helpful, if somewhat substantial, document—notes on clauses—that was circulated to members of the Committee by the Department is cross-referenced to the private Bill. The private Bill and the cross-referencing to it, which is vital to the whole understanding of each clause, will be the basis of our consideration, so copies should be available. I do not know who is responsible for supplying information to the Committee, but I think that it is perfectly proper to suggest that the Department and those responsible make such information available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Rhodri Morgan. A brief intervention, please.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rhodri Morgan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way and to you, Mr. Winterton, for your guidance. My hon. Friend referred to the non-availability of copies of the private Bill. That may be because I took the last copy from the Vote Office yesterday—the November 1989 version. There have been many versions of the Bill. The November 1988 version is out of print and still unavailable but I have a copy here which is marked Bill 94. That is an exaggeration. There are four versions of the Bill in its pristine state—two private and two Government—and, of course, subsequent versions. Studying the Bills is a mountainous task, but I agree with my hon. Friend that the four original Bills should be available to the Committee so that we can see what has happened to costs and other factors since November 1988.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend rightly points to the dilemmas in which the Committee will find itself because of the history and parentage of the Bill. I have a more modest request; that the private Bill which is cross-referenced with this Bill in the Government's own notes on clauses be made available to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have problems dealing with the Bill. The Minister will say that it was not his Bill in the first place. Behind him are the shadows of the original promotors of the Bill, yet this is a public Bill and, in the valuable notes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
on clauses provided by the Department, there is constant cross-referencing to an original private Bill—to which of the 94 versions it refers is for the Government to reveal. Therefore, before we agree to a sittings motion will the Minister give us an assurance that there will be an adequate supply of the private Bill to which his notes on clauses refer so that we can continually cross-reference the two Bills? That shows the practical dilemmas that we shall face when we come to detailed consideration of the Bill. The issue must be settled now before we agree to any sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly the next of my requests for information to be submitted to the Committee before we agree to a sittings motion is for the minutes of evidence taken when the Bill was a private Bill to be produced. We are in an interesting dilemma. As well as the report of the Bill's Second Reading there is voluminous evidence taken by a small four-man Committee who took the private Bill through the private Bill procedure. That evidence reflects the fears and anxieties of thousands of householders and objectors as well as the promoters' defence of the Bill. Surely that material is fundamental to our consideration, yet I cannot see it in the Room. Of course we can ask for that elaborate collection of evidence from the Bill's promoters or from the Private Bill office, but before we vote on the sittings motion we should tackle the fundamental problem of the lack of evidence in an easy and manageable form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have taken advice from the Clerk on the matter. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows from his ministerial experience and from his many years in the House that it would be impossible to bring all the evidence to which he has referred into a Committee Room. All that information is available to members of the Committee in the private Bill Office if they wish to study it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton, for that advice, but in my ministerial and parliamentary experience I have not encountered this situation before. This Committee is unique. As a long-standing, practising Member on both the Front and Back Benches I have never come across such a dilemma or problem. There has never been a private Bill that became a public Bill and went to a Standing Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My request is more modest than you may think, Mr. Winterton. Evidence given to a Committee of the House has been minuted, so it is not necessary to fetch shelf-loads of original evidence submitted by the promoters. If we want to bury ourselves in the original memoranda, it is up to us to do that in the diligent fashion that we shall all employ in considering the Bill, but surely the evidence of the cross-examination by Members of this House who took the private Bill through the private Bill procedure should be easily available to the Committee, because it shows the worries and wishes of those in the community. Although those worries have been aired, this Committee cannot take such evidence. That is why I hope that the evidence given to the private Bill Committee can be easily reachable during our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental need for an updated economic appraisal of the project. The basis of the Government's case for supporting a private Bill that involves so much public expenditure is that the amount of public money going into the scheme will have enormous consequences for private
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
investment and will create new jobs. The economic appraisal available to members of the Committee was made in 1989 and published in January 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me remind new Members of the House who are serving on the Committee of the nature and character of the public expenditure consequences of the Bill. That is part of why I am making such a powerful case, which I hope that the Committee will support, for not accepting a sittings motion until the Minister assures us that we shall get an economic update and reappraisal of the whole scheme. The works authorised by the Bill were initially to cost £85 million. With additions and inflation, the price tag on the Bill as it stands now has virtually doubled. During the time that the Bill has been under consideration, the cost has risen from £85 million to £152 million. That is not private investment, but public investment; it is state capital expenditure from the Welsh Office's budget, through the Cardiff Bay development corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this day and age, such a sum may sound modest, but the barrage-related cost shave risen from £402 million to £547 million. Therefore, we are considering not just a sum of about £150 million—roughly double the original amount—but additional expenditure which totals £550 million. In a letter of 13 December 1990, Mr. Nicholas Bennett, the former Under-Secretary of State, stated that £335 million of that £550 million would come out of Welsh Office funds. What is involved is not a modest public expenditure scheme in a corner of the city, but huge public expenditure of a kind and character that should make us ponder its worth and whether the claims made for such public expenditure will be justified subsequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original cost has doubled and barrage-related costs have risen from £402 million to—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must ask the hon. Gentleman to speak to the sittings motion and remind him that clause 1 and the first amendment that I have selected will enable him to develop his argument. I do not wish him to develop that argument now during the debate on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your advice, Mr. Winterton, but the barrage-related expenditure that I am describing is not related to clause 1. I should have thought that it was perfectly proper to raise that issue in demanding an economic reappraisal of the scheme before the Committee approves a sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example of a capital expenditure not related to clause 1—and this may surprise new Members who are serving on the Committee—is the approval of a one and a quarter mile road going through the area, which will cost £90 million: that is £60 million a mile. The hon. Members for Monmouth (Mr. Evans), for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans) and for Ceredigion and Pembroke, North (Mr. Dafis) can envisage as well as I can what could be done with £90 million worth of road expenditure. I have a sneaking suspicion that we could manage more than one and a quarter miles. However, the Bill and the barrage-related costs will incur such expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis and justification of such costs were the economic appraisals presented to the House in various forms during the proceedings of the Bill so far. It is perfectly proper to draw attention to what has happened to those economic appraisals since they were presented to the House and to demand that they be updated before the sittings motion is agreed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) should not probe keenly the questions of cost and finance, but there is a point about the road that I hope that he will take on board. There has been much anxiety that that road, which would go through Cardiff's docks area, would divide the community in half. I worked in that community for some years. It is a very deprived community and belongs to my constituency. The cut and cover that is envisaged is a positive factor as it will ensure that the community is not divided. I am sure that my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Briefly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Public expenditure involves the language not of envy but of priorities. I support schemes of such environmental and social importance. However, the same expenditure would have allowed a considerable start to be made on the dual-carriaging of the heads of the valleys road, which is vital to the economic regeneration of the whole area. It is a matter of comparative priorities, but I shall pause there, Mr. Winterton, having made enough of an allusion to deal with my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My point is that we cannot support the sittings motion until the Minister assures the Committee that an update of the scheme's economic appraisal will be supplied. That appraisal is the basis of the Government's justification of the expenditure on the barrage itself and on related schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am showing the Committee the economic appraisal that is presently available to hon. Members. It is dated 5 January 1990 and is based on information provided in 1989. It makes a series of massive assumptions about the nature of demand for commercial and residential property and about the future trend of land values. It provides the basis for the claim that 30,000 jobs will be created and that private and public investment will be in the ratio of 6:1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Committee believe that a report on property values and prices compiled in the 1989–90 period does not include outdated assumptions about the philosophy of the economics of property development? Have we not seen, since the economic appraisal was published, a massive collapse of confidence in property market values? The most dramatic example is the Canary Wharf scheme, but similar schemes exist in smaller degree, up and down the country. Property companies as well as property assessments and values are undergoing a sea-change in thinking and approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will this economic appraisal be the only one to be made available to the Committee? It is two years out of date, and in those two years the whole world of property values and finances has altered. Does the Minister mean to defend this
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill by saying that the commercial, industrial and residential property developments in Cardiff bay, and its estimated values and rentals, are innoculated against and immune to the national and international property market? If that is the Government's case, they will have to prove it. No one else believes that the world of property financing and property values has not changed, but we are asked to scrutinise the Bill and consider a sittings motion with an economic appraisal that is two years out of date. Wonderful statements appear in the appraisal. Page 37 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The estimates of value have been set against a number of underlying general assumptions, the main ones of which are as follows … gently improving UK economy"—</p></blockquote>
we can have a debate about that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and a stable national and international property market."</p></blockquote>
Will any member of the Committee dare to suggest that we have a stable national and international property market?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not half as bad as his brother.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I should follow that avenue, although I am sure that you might be interested in the matter, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an article on the world of property and the assumptions behind it, Mr. Sam Brittan quotes, as late as Thursday 18 June, from the Bank for International Settlements:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Real estate price deflation, if that is what it should be called, might be considered to be a new phenomenon in the postwar economic history of industrial countries … If not contained, it could not only have further repercussions on financial institutions in the countries concerned but also affect the prospects for full economic recovery."</p></blockquote>
Here is a major international organisation forecasting a sea change in the whole attitude towards property prices and the assumptions behind them. Yet we are supposed blindly to go on with a Bill that will have consequences for public expenditure and implications for and jobs, which is based on an economic appraisal that is out of date because it was written before the property market crashed. I recommend that members of the Committee read the article.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that the economic appraisal refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"a stable national and international property market".</p></blockquote>
Does the graph in the article show a stable international property market? The United Kingdom, Australia, the United States and Japan are shown in the graph. Dramatic changes in the assumptions behind property values are evident. Are the Government going to defend the Bill and the public expenditure that will flow from it, by quoting an estimate made in 1989–90 and claim that the nature of property values is the same now as it was then? Will any member of the Committee make the case that Cardiff is immunised against any change in the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
We have a problem—I throw myself at your feet, Mr. Winterton, as I know you to be a kind and gentle man—in that, if we do not discuss the fundamental economic assessment behind the scheme now, we shall not have the opportunity to do so unless we consider it when we discuss clause 1, as we could if you, Sir, allowed some latitude. Much of the expenditure to which the Bill refers and many of the assumptions behind it are related not only to capital expenditure on the barrage. Behind the justification for the Bill lies a series of assumptions, made by the Government and economists, that are two years out of date. Before we accept a sittings motion, the Minister should assure the Committee that he will produce an update of the economic appraisal. Most of the value assumptions in the original assessment have been knocked for six by the change in the property market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all fishing in the same public expenditure pot as regards the Welsh Office budget. I represent a community that has lost a fifth of its jobs in the past 10 years: 17,000 jobs have been destroyed. Yet, in the same period, in south Glamorgan—the beneficiary of the large chunk of public investment set out in the Bill—jobs increased by 11,000. At a time when we are discussing a form of convergence between the 12 European economies, a huge divergence exists between two counties and two communities that are only 25 or 30 miles apart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) agree that, although unemployment in his constituency has remained remarkably high, unemployment in my constituency, which is in the centre of Cardiff and which will be affected by the Bill, is even higher? Unemployment in south Cardiff has reached historically higher levels than unemployment in the valley communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Comparisons over a decade show that 11,000 extra jobs have been created in south Glamorgan, whereas 17,000 fewer jobs exist in the valley communities. That is divergence, not convergence. I am sorry to hear about unemployment in my hon. Friend's constituency, but we need a programme of positive discrimination in capital investment for the valley communities, and we seek funds from the same budget that provides money for the Cardiff bay barrage development scheme. The valley communities have a greater claim to priority in public expenditure. We could use £90 million to create dual carriageways along the heads of the valleys road. We should not sign the blank cheque that the Government have provided for the Bill. Until the Minister gives us the assurances and information that I have requested, I do not know whether I shall support the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to continue where my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney left off in presenting various points that need to be clarified before the Committee can judge how many sittings we want and how much material should properly be considered as we tackle the Bill line by line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is important and the amount of public expenditure involved is large. Most important, however, the Bill is a shambles. A measure is described as a hybrid Bill if it contains elements of a private Bill, which is considered by a Select Committee, and elements of public
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Bill, which is discussed in a Standing Committee. The present Bill is not a hybrid Bill, but a mongrel Bill—or worse, a cross between a mongrel and a hybrid Bill. The Government know that the Bill is defective, and the Select Committee made recommendations to which they agreed in principle, the Government will adjust the Bill in accordance with those recommendations when the Bill goes to another place, as they do not wish to make those adjustments in Committee. Is it right for us, at the beginning of a new Parliament, to support a procedure that will make the Bill even more shambolic by accepting that the recommendations of the Select Committee to which the Government agreed at the end of the last Parliament should be incorporated in the Bill not now, but when the measure is considered in another place? The Government wish to do that because it would re-hybridise the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am always fascinated by the hon. Gentleman's arguments, but his current argument has no relevance to the sittings motion. That hon. Gentleman can develop massive arguments when the Committee considers amendments, but will he please now direct his remarks exclusively to the sittings motion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to cross swords with you, Mr. Winterton. I was trying to express the amplitude of considerations that we need to bear in mind when we decide how many sittings we require. Will we wish to adjust the Bill to include the Select Committee recommendations in this House? The Government accept that those recommendations need to be included, but do not wish to include them in Committee. If we wish to make those adjustments in Committee because we believe that that is the right democratic way to handle the Bill, we shall need additional sittings, or more time within the sittings. That is why I describe the measure as a mongrel Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is also defective because the Government have decided to reverse a Select Committee recommendation, which may not re-hybridise the Bill. I hope that when the Minister gives the Government's estimate of the number of sittings that we need and whether we require afternoon sittings, he will tell us whether the Government intend to adjust the Bill further and reverse Select Committee recommendations? That will require time and will affect the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do the Government intend to re-introduce the provision dealing with the Wentlooge foreshore alternative feeding grounds? That proposal is included in the November 1991 Bill, but not in the 8 May version, which was drafted after the proceedings of the Select Committee. Before we can decide finally how many sittings we need, we need to know whether the Government will re-introduce that provision in Committee. If not, will the proposal be re-introduced in another place? We understand that the Government intend to re-incorporate the proposal for the Wentlooge tidal lagoon, which was removed on the recommendation of the Select Committee. The Government's decision will affect the amount of time that we need to consider the measure, because the proposal will mean substantial additional expenditure. If the proposal is not to be re-introduced at this stage, the Committee is being asked to participate in a confidence trick by happily passing a Bill which is defective or which will be adjusted in another place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The Government find themselves in a shambles: they have to re-introduce into the Bill proposals that the Select Committee has taken out. They also need to comply with Select Committee recommendations that they resisted until the last minute. The Government finally backed off and accepted some of the recommendations made by Cardiff city council; they decided abjectly to surrender. How will the Government effect the shake-hands deal that they had to make when they surrendered to the superior knowledge and skills of Cardiff city council in relation to drainage ditches, which need to be retro-fitted into terraced houses in large areas of inner-city Cardiff? Until the final hour of the Select Committee's proceedings, the Government claimed that that was not necessary and did not require any change in the Bill. How will that be dealt with, and what effect will it have on the sittings motion? I hope that the Under-Secretary realises that he must clear that up before we can make a decision on the sittings motion. I am looking for a movement in the hon. Gentleman's sphinx-like expression but receiving no guidance as to whether he will be dealing with these matters—which is why I want to draw them to your attention, Mr. Winterton. Will the Government come clean, for once, on this Bill and try not to carry on in such a shambolic fashion?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) mentioned finance, which will be dealt with when we reach clause 1, but the question whether the Government have got their act together and are ready to give us the assurances that we need—that they have costs under control—is material to the sittings motion. There has been so much of a shambles surrounding the Bill that the Government must realise how seriously the Opposition take tight control over public expenditure. The conventional wisdom in politics is that we chuck money around as though it were going out of fashion whereas the Government are tight-fisted, and evaluate and do cost-benefit analyses before they will part with so much as a farthing of maundy money on Good Friday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the reverse is the case. If a project is a favourite plaything of the Government, they chuck money around as if it were going out of fashion, saying, "£20 million here, £5 million there. Who cares? This is one our Bills." The Government's philosophy as regards the present Bill, unfortunately, is that they are prepared to approve increases in public expenditure without giving them proper consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know from the Under-Secretary, before we approve the sittings motion, exactly how firm a grip the Government have on the costs of the proposed barrage. Do they have a document that they can give us—perhaps by Thursday—which says what the cost was in November 1989, using the financial memorandum based on November 1988 prices which was on the face of that private Bill? The document should list the cost of each element of the work proposed, including, possibly, the Wentlooge foreshore lagoon, if the Government intend to reincorporate it in the Bill to take it back to its pristine November 1991 state. My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked for the November 1989 costs, based on the November 1988 memorandum, so that we could compare those figures with the financial memorandum on the face of the November 1991 Bill on which the Bill before the Committee is loosely based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney also made a point about the apparent rate of inflation. Before we can approve the sittings motion, we want to know both the real rate of inflation in relation to the costs of works in the Bill, and the consequences of the design changes. Can the Under-Secretary provide the Committee with an updated financial appraisal of the works that we are being asked to authorise and with a cost-benefit analysis showing the demand for and supply of land for the offices, leisure facilities, housing and industry that are the indirect consequences of the Bill. Those are separate consequences to which my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and will no doubt return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot approve the sittings motion if the shambles of last week is continued. I need to tell you, Mr. Winterton, why I am emphasising this point in the sittings motion debate. Last week I had an apology from the Secretary of State for Wales because the Welsh Office had submitted a document in relation to the advertisement of the bay barrage scheme for tender in the 	<i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities. That document contained an error of £5.7 million. Such projects have to be advertised under the single market public procurement policy of the European Communities, otherwise large grants from the EC of £40 million may be lost. I do not want to go into too much detail about that, except to say that, having advertised the project, the Welsh Office had to admit that it had used the wrong figures. It said that the project would cost £113 million, forgetting that, because of the Select Committee proceedings, it had taken out the £5.7 million-worth of expenditure on the Wentlooge lagoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, later this morning, the Government say that some of our sittings will have to be devoted to consideration of a Government amendment, or give an undertaking that the second-House proceedings will re-incorporate the Wentlooge lagoon and the collector drain, costing £5.7 million, that will be relevant to the motion. If we are to consider it in the Committee, it will be an extra debate, if it is to be considered in the other place, that will be one fewer debate here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the only shambles. Standing Committees are given estimates of the public expenditure costs of a project and a price base for them—whether in November 1988 or July 1989 prices. On any project that will take more than a year to construct, the outturn cost is highly relevant. The Under-Secretary's predecessor but two—there may be a lesson for the Under-Secretary in that the previous two Ministers who have dealt with the project both lost their seats at the general election—the then hon. Member for Cardiff, Central who was dealing with the project until November 1990, is the most recent Minister to have provided an outturn estimate. On a project that will take four and a half years to construct, an outturn estimate is highly relevant, so I tabled a parliamentary question for answer yesterday afternoon, asking for the most up-to-date outturn estimate. The Government were unable to give one; they simply repeated the snapshot estimate at 1990 prices given by the Under-Secretary of State's predecessor but one in the debate in November 1991—£152.5 million, including the barrage, the sewer diversions and the ground water compensation works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister winds up the debate, before too long, he must tell us his present inflation and outturn estimates. Does he have them? Will he be able to present them to the Committee when we debate clause 1, the works and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
finance? Reading the previous Bills which go back to November 1989, the degree of freedom that the Government think that they have alarms me. That is completely unacceptable in a Standing Committee, which is set up to examine the Bill line by line. Second Readings tend to be discursive, but the Committee must have all the figures nailed down. Before we approve the sittings motion, the Government must be completely open and honest and tell us the exact figures for the inflation estimates and the outturn cost over the four and half years of construction on a comparable basis to that given by Ian Grist when he was the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central. He put figure at £147.7 million. It is not enough merely to have the snapshot figures, which are not meaningful for a four-and-a-half-year project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lack of precision so far, which must end this morning before we approve the motion, is further reflected in a letter I received from the House of Commons Library. I wrote to the Library to elicit the most reasonable figures one could assume for the cost of inflation associated with the scheme. That letter followed a parliamentary question I tabled on the 16 June, asking how the Welsh Office had arrived at its figure for the cost of the barrage and the drainage works at the Wentlooge—which was included then, as the Government had forgotten that the Select Committee had removed it from the scheme. What proportion of the increased cost arose from inflation and what proportion arose from design changes? That is a reasonable question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not prepared to tolerate the development of that argument any longer. It is a waste of time and is not directly related to the sittings motion. If the hon. Gentleman has other points that he wishes to make querying the motion, will he raise them now? I have heard enough about the economic argument. It is not relevant and is tedious repetition of what was said in a different way by the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. Will the hon.

	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Winterton, for your comments. The points that I am making are not directly related to the cost benefit analysis of, or the demand for, the land that will be enhanced in value, but to the works which my hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney mentioned for, no more than a few seconds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If that is the case, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney because, I repeat, that issue will come up under clause 1. Will the hon. Gentleman direct his remarks to that issue at the appropriate time and not on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raise this matter on the sittings motion to question whether the Government know what they are talking about? Have they got their figures in order? If they have not, we cannot approve the sittings motion. If the Government's figures are in a shambles, we are not in a fit state to move on from the sittings motion to the substantive motions. That is how I feel although I am mere amateur in these matters when compared to you, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been trying to elicit a response from the Minister by telling him what public expenditure control we consider important on a major item of public expenditure. Are the Government's figures in order? The letter that I have from
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
the Library which, although very short, I will not read out, simply says that the Welsh Office did not know which inflation adjustments it was using in calculating the rise in costs from £85 million to £113 million. I make that point in the debate on the sittings motion to show the shambles that consideration of this Bill is in. Perhaps the most important point to be considered in the debate on the sittings motion is the fact that Government's sometimes find it difficult to adjust policies that were decided upon in a completely different economic climate. When a Government have to reconsider their policies, they find that it is like trying to reverse the Titanic before hitting the iceberg.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is continually being changed—items are being taken out of the financial memorandum and are then put back into it. That gives us very little confidence. The less confidence Opposition Members have in the state of the Government's updated cost benefit analysis and in their mastery of what inflation estimates they are using and the type of outturn costs which, in turn, will affect the economic viability of these projects, the more we need to discuss those subjects. They are the very material of a sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have evidence that various committees are being used as ramps to reward faithful servants of the Conservative party. The Government have used the Cardiff Bay development corporaton in that way. When the late and much lamented councillor Ron Watkiss died, he was replaced not by councillors John Phillips or Geoff Mungham from Splott, who were the choices of Cardiff city council but, on the insistence of the Government, by councillor Jeff Sainsbury, who was then Lord Mayor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. All that is fascinating information. I am tempted to ask the hon.

One problem is that the Committee has been stuffed full of English Members of Parliament in order to provide the Government with an artificial majority because they could not win a majority in democratic elections. That is why the Committee has a large carpetbagging element on the Conservative Benches. Because they are unable to win elections, the Conservatives need to reward their party members with seats on quangos such as the Cardiff Bay development corporation. That is why I raised the point in the first place and why, in my opinion—which I submit for your guidance, Mr. Winterton—it is highly relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall skim over the point that I was making earlier and simply say that it grates on people in Cardiff that this Committee has been abused by the bringing in of a Conservative majority which cannot be won by democratic means. It is very wrong to incorporate that majority into the Committee by undemocratic means. It is, in a way, a parallel to the way in which people from the same masonic lodge as the Under-Secretary of State for Wales—Mr. Sainsbury and, before he died, Ron Watkiss—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall allow the hon. Gentleman one more warning before I ask him to resume his seat. Will he please direct his remarks to the sittings motion and not make extraneous comments which have no relevance at all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One other point is relevant to the sittings motion—it relates to the environment of the south Wales foreshore, of which the bay is a critical part. We do not know whether it will be debated in Committee, because we do not know whether the Government will bring in their own clause or whether it will be up to us to raise the matter. We have tabled a few trial amendments, mainly to see whether they will stimulate the Government into tabling their own. We understand that they will deal with the matter because they have given a written undertaking to the Countryside Council for Wales to reincorporate the Wentlooge lagoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to the other matters with which the Government have not yet dealt, so shambolic is the Bill at the moment. They have not been able to tell us—I hope that they will this morning, otherwise it will be difficult for us to accept the sittings motion—what approach they will take to the low flow, or dry weather flow, water budget, an issue which has been raised before. We understand that they said that they would deal with that by private treaty with Associated British Ports, which controls the Blackweir lock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into the matter in detail. The question is simply whether the Government are going to come clean and tell us that they have a deal with Associated British Ports, which is to the satisfaction of the National Rivers Authority and in line with the written undertakings given to that authority by the Secretary of State for Wales before Second Reading, in return for which the authority agreed not to oppose the legislation. The result is that we are not discussing the issue at this stage, but there is an undertaking that it might be discussed at a later stage in another place if the Government cannot give satisfaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that we should have an assurance this morning in the debate on the sittings motion that the Government can clear up the point. Will they tell us that they now have an agreement with ABP over the control of dry weather river flow into the impounded bay—without which it will be very difficult to control the water quality? About half the flow down the Taff and Ely will be treated sewage, which will create an algal scum. We do not wish to deal with that matter now and will return to it later, but we hope that the Minister will be able to tell us something about whether the Welsh Office has cleaned up its act in respect of water quality guarantees. It cannot give such guarantees unless it has control of the Blackweir lock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those points were, I believe, made by some Conservative Members when they were campaigning against the Usk barrage during the general election campaign and, in one case, during a be-election campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want the Minister to tell us this morning not whether the Government approve of this barrage, but whether they have a policy on barrages in general. The Usk barrage is only nine miles east of the Taff and Ely barrage. We understand that two Conservative Members on the Committee campaigned against the Usk barrage with the full support of the Secretary of State for Wales, who described it as a temple to municipal socialism when he launched the Conservative local government campaign in April this year. Although the Secretary of State was against
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
the Usk barrage, he is in favour of the Cardiff barrage and is willing to throw at it £152·5 million not on an out-turn basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During a sittings motion debate it is right and proper to ask the Welsh Office to come clean and explain its policy on barrages. Does it have a device for discriminating between two barrages? Was it against the Usk barrage because that scheme was promoted by a Labour local authority and it is in favour of the Taff and Ely barrage because it is promoted by a Conservative Government and because the board is stuffed full of the masonic lodge mates of the Under-Secretary of State? If so, that is an inadequate approach to policy and I hope that the Under-Secretary will clear up that issue this morning. What is the policy on barrages into which the proposed Taff and Ely barrage is meant to fit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just seen the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Evans) pass a note to the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans) who is constructing a reply. Does my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend; he is more observant than I am when it comes to what is going on among the stony-faced carpetbaggers on the Conservative Benches. Perhaps the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans) will read out what the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. Evans) said in his little note. I shall give way to him now if he wants to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary will give a hint of the Government's policy on the clutch of questions relating to the environment. Where do negotiations stand on the European Community Municipal Waste-water directive? That is relevant to the sittings motion because, without such knowledge, we cannot know how many sittings will be necessary. If the directive defines as sensitive certain waters adjoining the barrage, that will have a colossal impact on water standards, to which some clauses in the Bill refer. However, if there are ongoing negotiations between the National Rivers Authority, Welsh Water, the Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office, which will take months, perhaps we should adjourn consideration of the Bill until we know whether the directive's references to sensitive water will apply to waters just inside or outside the proposed barrage. Those negotiations started six months ago and were supposed to finish by Christmas but have been delayed and delayed. Before we can decide how many debates we shall require on the Bill, we need to know the exact state of the negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy on the Bill is either, "Don't know" or, "Won't tell", which makes it difficult for us to approve the sittings motion. The Stoner report, which was published in February this year, made recommendations on studying dewatering wells. The Cardiff Bay development corporation was to commission the study and Hydrotechnica was to carry it out. Has that process been completed? Will the Minister publish the conclusions on dewatering wells, which, in turn, will have a major impact on the financial memorandum and the amount of money to be spent on groundwater compensation? Can the Minister tell us whether the Stoner recommendations on groundwater dewatering wells as an alternative to tanking basements have been completed? If they have, that would have a tremendous impact on our consideration of the Bill and the enormous 14-page schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
How can we decide on the sittings motion this morning if the Government do not come clean on the follow-up to the Stoner report, the second Hydrotechnica report as it may be called, which the Cardiff Bay development corporation commissioned from Hydrotechnica, on the Secretary of State's instructions, following the publication of the Stoner report? There is an enormous schedule to the Bill dealing with groundwater compensation. Considerations of that and of whether dewatering wells are an effective alternative or supplement to basement tanking are enormously important to thousands of my constituents. Half of the private version of the Bill dealt with groundwater compensation, but we have not had a word from the Welsh Office about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the economic and engineering feasibility study on the centre for performing arts, which is sometimes known as the alternative home for Welsh National Opera on Cardiff Bay, which was commissioned after Second Reading. We believe that it has been completed but we do not know whether it has been published. How do we decide on our sittings if the Welsh Office will not part with information that will help us?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Welsh Office is hiding the truth on all factors relevant to the Bill. It will not come clean, which makes everybody suspect that there is something fishy going on that the Government are anxious to hide. They should produce all relevant information which will enable the Committee to decide how many debates we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other changes have been made very recently. We need some comment from the Government because they are relevant to the work of the Committee. What will the Government say about the application of minimum statutory distances between houses and refuse tips?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have already drawn the Committee's attention to irrelevance and tedious repetition on the part of the hon. Gentleman. I now instruct him to resume his seat. I have heard quite enough of his arguments, which have absolutely nothing to do with the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jon Owen Jones 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can assure you, Mr. Winterton, that I shall be brief. My experience is in local government rather than in Parliament and I have not yet learnt how to spin out my contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we can agree to the sittings motion, I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Committee will be able to consider the Opposition's amendments. They will strengthen the Bill and gain the confidence of those most affected by it. As a new Member representing a Cardiff constituency, I know that the Bill provides an exciting development for the people of the capital city. However, like most exciting prospects, it is not without its dangers, and some may consider that those dangers are great. I am concerned about how those dangers will affect my constituency of Cardiff, Central, but also about the general effect on the city. I would like the Minister's assurance on three issues before I agree to a sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, Mr. Winterton, one important issue is groundwater. Although the major effect is in Cardiff, South and in Cardiff, West, the issue greatly concerns two wards in my constituency, Adamsdown and Plasnewydd, where
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
the houses may be affected by groundwater problems. Provision for compensation should be strengthened and supported by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I would be brief, Mr. Winterton. The second issue is water quality. Many reports commissioned by the Cardiff Bay development corporation have shown that the Taff and Ely are nutrient rich rivers. That is a nice way of saying that they contain a large amount of sewage. The algae in water impounded behind the barrage will benefit from the high nutrient level. In good summers—of which we seem to be getting more and more—there will be a huge algal bloom across the lake. In technical terms, that is called a eutrophication of the lake. The greatest danger is that, when the algae begins to rot in late summer, there will be a massive development of bacteria in the water. That bacteria would not necessarily be harmful, but would lower the water's oxygen level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, water quality would be poor. Before the sittings motion is agreed, I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that he will examine the problem and its solutions with care. Those solutions include skimming material off the top of the water and pumping oxygen into the water, but will they be enough to ensure a reasonable water quality? Will they allow normal watersports to be pursued and will they prevent the water from becoming unsightly?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of keeping the water clean will not go away once the Cardiff bay development corporation has built the barrage, and neither will the problem of dewatering to ensure a low groundwater level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have shown the hon. Gentleman considerable discretion. I realise that he is a new Member of Parliament, but he is going into far too much detail on this matter for a debate on the sittings motion. What he has to say will be very relevant later in our proceedings. He has made his point in seeking an assurance on this matter. I suggest that he moves on to other matters, or sits down if he has nothing else to say to the Minister on the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Owen Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do have one last point, Mr. Winterton. I did not understand that I had to adhere so closely to the sittings motion, given that I was trying to be as brief as possible. My final point is that the costs incurred in dewatering and in pumping oxygen into the lake will be borne by the local authority. Will the Minister give an estimate of those costs? I have not found any reference to them in the Bill. I should be grateful for some enlightenment, as it would enable me to get the sittings motion into better perspective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alan W. Williams 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Carmarthen)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked to serve on the Committee because the Cardiff bay barrage, if it is built, will represent the investment of the single largest tranche of public money ever to be put into Wales. As a result, money that otherwise would go into alternative projects will be concentrated on one small area of Wales. In addition to my anxiety about the economic costs and consequences, I am also worried about the environmental implications for the birds that feed on the mudflats. I share the worry about water quality expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Owen Jones). I hope that there will be enough sittings for the Committee to examine clauses 1 and 10, which deal respectively with the economic and environmental effects of the Bill, in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The mudflats are very important. They are used by wading birds that migrate from Alaska, Russia and Greenland. The Government have just signed a biodiversity treaty at the Earth summit in Rio, but in Wales we are about to ruin a precious square mile of mudflats in Cardiff bay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am even more worried about the quality of the impounded water behind the barrage. The Taff and Ely are the dirtiest rivers in Wales. It gives me no joy to say that but it is a fact of life. Last year the National Rivers Authority published a national survey of rivers. A stretch of the Towy below Carmarthen has been labelled fair in quality because it contains sewage, but the Ely is the dirtiest river in Wales; the water quality is bad throughout virtually the whole of the river's length. The survey of the Welsh region shows that 54 per cent. of our rivers are very good, 32 per cent. of river length is good, 8 per cent. is fair, 6 per cent. is poor and 1 per cent. is bad. Most of the Ely falls within that 6 or 7 per cent. range. Parts of the river Taff are classified as being in the bottom quarter or fifth of Welsh rivers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best thing to do with water in the Taff and the Ely is to let it go into the sea as quickly as possible because it is so dirty and full of partially treated sewage and the nutrients that my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central mentioned. I hope that we shall be reassured that, by impounding such water, we are not building up a severe environmental problem for ourselves by the end of the decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In summer, when river flow is slow, the mean time for water to be impounded behind the barrage will be 50 days. During that period, the levels of nitrates and phosphates will build up and cause euthrophication problems. My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central talked about smimming off the surface of the water: that sounds a pretty desperate measure. He also mentioned pumping in oxygen. We have an oxygen injection system on the Towy below Carmarthen but I regret to say that the technology does not work. I have studied the Library's research notes on the Bill, which concede that oxygen injection is almost an experimental system. There is no proof that it works. If it does not, a square mile of grey-green soup will appear in hot summer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I echo a remark made by my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney about the inadequate information provided on the Bill. I should like to have available the NRA's views and comments on the scheme. I have a high regard for the work of the NRA: its establishment is one of the great successes of the previous Government. The NRA's analysis of the Taff and Ely and of the problems of impounding the water needs detailed consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about the difference in estimates of the cost of the project. We have figures of £85 million, £150 million, £300 million and even £547 million—a sixfold variation in the public sector input into the scheme alone. As we consider the clauses, I hope that the cost will be established. Again I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, who said that we need an updated economic appraisal of the true cost and potential benefits. Calculating those benefits on 1989–90 assumptions—for the period of that brief economic miracle when property prices were rocketing and house prices zooming—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should now recognise the mood of the Chairman, who is not very happy to hear further economic arguments. The hon. Gentleman is trespassing on the Second Reading debate. He must relate his remarks entirely and exclusively to the sittings motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Williams</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, Mr. Winterton, I hope that if the Committee confines itself to morning sittings over the next few weeks, there will be enough time to go through the economic arguments, for which we need the updated appraisal. Also, I hope that the hon. Members for Brecon and Radnor (Mr. Evans) and for Monmouth (Mr. Evans) will explain why they and the Secretary of State believe that a barrage is a good idea for Cardiff but not for Newport. There is a flagrant contradiction in their position, which I hope that they can explain during our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns the democratic deficit in the Committee, about whose composition there was a debate two weeks ago on the Floor of the House. We were very disappointed that the Government steamrollered through a motion excluding about 50 hon. Members, 20 of whom were Opposition Members. If public expenditure in Wales were administered by a Welsh assembly in Cardiff—which Opposition Members believe should be the case—there is no doubt that the Cardiff bay barrage would not be built. There is no justification for spending £300 million or £400 million on a prestige project in Cardiff when we need to provide for our health service, schools, transport infrastructure, and housing. Our communities in all areas of Wales need jobs, not just those in the corridor along the M4 and the A55. The Bill would be rejected out of hand if there were a Parliament in Cardiff. Over the next few weeks, I shall seek assurances that matters are not as bad I perceive them, and I hope that the Committee has sufficient time to explore the Bill in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Alun Michael: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cardiff, South and Penarth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure, Mr. Winterton, to work under your chairmanship of the Committee once more. I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) was about to say that membership of this Committee under your chairmanship was a reward for good behaviour by Government Members, but then he went on to talk about quangos. However, your chairmanship undoubtedly makes the Committee more attractive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, I feel sorry for the Minister. He must pick up the problems bequeathed by his predecessor, whose unhelpful approach and style was a direct cause of delaying consideration of the Bill before the general election. I hope that the Minister will learn a lesson from that and set the tone for our proceedings in his response to the debate on the sittings motion. He must give serious consideration to amendments that would improve the Bill. He must also answer seriously probing amendments and questions from Opposition Members, while explaining clearly his rejection of any amendments that he feels would undermine the purpose of the Bill. A positive response from the Minister will be helpful in our consideration of the sittings motion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) has referred to the mass of evidence that has accrued in the long-drawn-out journey—one might even call it contorted—from initial proposal to legislation and eventual Royal Assent. I remind the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Committee of the massive investment of time and effort made by the Bill's supporters. Many Opposition Members were puzzled that a Bill of such public importance should have to endure the truly awful private Bill route. Originally, the Bill was submitted as a private measure by the choice of the Government, the Welsh Office and the then Secretary of State for Wales. I also remind the Committee of the sterling work of the Labour-controlled South Glamorgan county council, whose courage in locating its new county hall in the dereliction of the docklands was the first step in the redevelopment of south Cardiff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has already been said, consideration of when the Committee should sit requires that relevant costs and figures be probed, and justified by the Minister. I hope that he can give us precise answers. For legal reasons, the Bill must include figures that have nothing to do with the barrage, such as those for the primary distributor road which was referred to earlier and which, to the relief of the people of Grangetown in my constituency, was to have been built anyway. That cost is the greater because a major improvement has been to create the cut and cover that will avoid the division between the two halves of the Butetown ward in my constituency. I hope that the Minister will deal with that when he explains the costs, so that we can be clear about which costs are a direct result of having to construct the barrage and which have been brought into the Bill for legal and procedural reasons, which we have discussed many times during consideration of the private Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has implied that the barrage-related costs are a technical, legal requirement. In all the documents, including the major economic appraisal, the Butetown fink is referred to as barrage-related expenditure. Therefore, it is legitimate to make that connection because the economic appraisal connects the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand fully that reasoning, but, as I probed at considerable length some time ago, the road would have been built irrespective of the barrage. Yet, because of the legal and technical requirements of the legislation, it must be included as if it were simply a barrage-related matter. That seems ludicrous to the honourable punter—the person who knew that the road would be built anyway. I have probed the issue and am satisfied that, for technical and legal reasons, it must be included in the costs as "barrage-related", although it is clearly not related to the cost of building the barrage. The same applies to the cut and cover costs. I make that point because it is clear that the cost of building the barrage is only a part of the figures that appear in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can all agree that the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill exposed the inadequate nature of the private Bill procedure and I hope that it proves to be the last nail in the coffin of that procedure, whose only fairness is in being equally unfair to supporters and opponents of any measure. All the delay is not the fault of my constituents or of the people in the wider area of Cardiff and south-east Wales who will benefit from the investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appropriate that some of my hon. Friends, such as my hon. Friends the Members for Carmarthen (Mr. Williams) and for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands), will want assurances on specific issues even though they do not have the direct constituency interest or the expectation of direct benefit that I have from
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
acceptance of the legislation. I remind them that the Bill deals with serious issues. In particular, I endorse the plea of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Owen Jones) that we should spend time dealing with the three specific issues of ground water compensation—I appreciate the priority that he puts on water in his constituency—of water quality and of the on-costs to local authorities after the construction of the barrage. We must give time to those important issues so that the legislation can be clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will appreciate that the councillors, individuals and organisations who have supported the Bill, as I have, deserve an end to the process, so that the benefits to the environment, in jobs and in homes can come to the heart of a city that desperately needs them. That will be assisted greatly if the Minister responds to the serious questions posed by the hon. Members who have spoken so far and considers positively the constructive amendments. I hope that the Minister will not be unresponsive in this Committee, but will accept it as the opportunity it should be to give a positive response to constructive amendments. Our job is to improve the Bill and ensure that the people of Cardiff have the best possible piece of legislation in place as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that we have reached the end of the debate on the sittings motion. It might be helpful if I tried to respond to various points. Before I do that, I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Winterton. The qualities that you will bring to bear will ensure that our deliberations are effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree essentially with the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy). He said that we must consider costs, water quality, ground water, relations with local councils, general environmental matters and how the Bill relates to the development of Cardiff and South Wales. I hope and expect that we shall have an opportunity to discuss all those important points, which were echoed by other hon. Members, for example the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Owen Jones) who referred especially to water quality and ground water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Torfaen told me to listen and the hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Mr. Michael) told me to display consideration and provide answers. I shall try to do that and I hope that those hon. Members will not find me lacking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr. Rowlands) reminded me of the precedent in which we are involved. I promised to write to him after our last debate on the measure—I hope that he received my letter. We are breaking new ground; we "boldly go where no man has gone before". There is nothing wrong with being a pioneer. I shall not go into the hon. Gentleman's suggestion of a Committee of 80-plus. That is a matter for the House. However, I believe that what we lack in quantity, we more than make up in quality on both sides of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney asked about the availability of past private Bills. I shall see what arrangements can be made to ensure that copies are available to members of the Committee. The hon. Gentleman also asked about the availability of the evidence of previous Committees. I agree with you, Mr. Winterton, that the minutes of the evidence on the private Bill are extensive; the Committee sat for 26 days. The hon. Member for Torfaen kindly referred to my anxieties about the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0202">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
environment. I suggest that hon. Members do their own research so that we do not cut down too many trees to supply all the extra paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask that one set of the minutes of the evidence be made available on the Committee Table? I do not know how many trees that would take-perhaps a twig or two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The learned Clerk says that it would be possible to place the originals on the Table.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney expressed the need for an economic appraisal. We shall cover that adequately in Committee. I assure him that the original economic appraisal was carried out in 1988; it was thoroughly up-dated in 1989 and again in 1990. The appraisal's sensitivity to large, unfavourable changes was tested at each stage and the conclusions proved and remain, robust. The appraisal considered economic benefits, not short-term business gains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister telling the Committee that the Government will not commit themselves at any stage to an up-dated, cost-benefit analysis, despite the collapse of Canary Wharf between the last update and today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, the economic appraisal has been up-dated. I am sure that we shall have more than adequate opportunity to discuss it, either under clause 1, which I hope that we shall move on to consider now, or later this morning, under clause 8, if we make sufficient progress. That leads me to the contribution of the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan). Earlier, Mr. Winterton, you seemed to think that the hon. Gentleman was waxing lyrical. Dare I suggest that those who come from Wales know that it is merely the same old song and one of which one can tire easily.

I am cautious about responding to the points made by the hon. Member for Cardiff, West in view of what you have said, Mr. Winterton, but I shall try to stick to the most germane. The hon. Gentleman referred to land drainage powers. We have been considering how best to meet the Select Committee's fears about the adequacy of local authorities' land drainage powers to deal with saturated land. A proposal to extend certain provisions in the Land Drainage Act 1991 so that they would apply to saturated land as well as to flooding has been put to the three local authorities. The National Rivers Authority and Welsh Water have also been kept fully informed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cardiff city council, which first raised the point before the Select Committee, has said that it is generally content with the proposal. Some minor points remain to be resolved with the council. Responses have also been received from the Vale of Glamorgan borough council, the National Rivers Authority and Welsh Water: none has raised any objection in principle. We have noted the remarks of the Chairman of the Select Committee on when those concerns might be met. We intend to table an amendment at the appropriate stage in another place.

The hon. Member for Cardiff, West also asked about arrangements with the NRA on river flow. Negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily. There is no need for the Government to table an amendment to the Bill on that account because there are already full controls in schedule 2 at paragraph 11(2)(c). The hon. Gentleman also asked whether the Government would say what was the projected cost of each work in 1989 in the private Bill and what it is in the current financial memorandum. I can answer yes to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the EC advertisement. The Cardiff Bay development corporation and not the Welsh Office was responsible for that advertisement. On alternative feeding grounds, we do not plan to re-insert the alternative feeding ground provisions in this Committee. Indeed, I doubt whether we shall introduce that proposal at all. However, we are exploring alternative mitigation measures with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Countryside Council for Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's answers. In reading them out so competently he has demonstrated why he is vice-president of the Dyslexia Institute. However, my question was whether the Minister can confirm that, following his agreement with Cardiff city council, he is asking the Committee to pass a measure that will rehybridise the Bill in the other place. That would mean that if the Bill completes its passage in the House of Lords, it will have to come back to this place to resolve the difference between the two Bills. Surely it would be better if we dealt with the matter in this House rather than have a Bill that we know to be defective going to the other place only to have it come back here again next year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Jones</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think that I can reassure the hon. Member for Cardiff, West that the most careful consideration has been give to how to handle the matter. All the adequate opportunities will be taken in the other place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised one last important point about dewatering. When my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made his statement after the completion of consultation exercises on ground water he said that, in view of the prospect of reducing the disruption to householders, he had asked the development corporation to commission a study of the proposal to control ground water levels by dewatering wells. My right hon. Friend also made it clear that he had not relied on the prospect of dewatering wells in making his decision that public funding would be made available for the construction of the barrage. The Select Committee was content to consider the Bill on that basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dewatering does not add uncertainty. If it proves to be feasible it offers the prospect of considerable greater certainty. However, if it is not feasible, the full range of protection in the Bill remains available. There is no need for the Committee to delay its consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer the hon. Members for Cardiff, Central and for Carmarthen the assurance that I am confident that the points of detail that they raised will be adequately covered in the Committee, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central on his tendency not to spin out his speeches based on his experience in local government. If he can maintain that talent for as long as possible, he will be increasingly appreciated.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. May I seek your guidance to facilitate the logical discussion of the Bill?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was surprised to find that the Under-Secretary of State has not tabled a motion on the order of consideration of the Bill, as it would be simple and logical to group schedule 1 and clause 1, as they go together. It is normal for a Minister to propose such a motion. I am making a constructive rather than a destructive suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can a member of the Committee propose a motion for the re-ordering of the consideration of a Bill? If so, are you willing to accept a manuscript amendment to the effect that clause 1 and schedule 1 should be taken together?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Member. It is normal for the Minister to table such a motion, but I do not think that the Under-Secretary of State intends to do so. Furthermore, discussions take place between the Minister and the Opposition through the usual channels. If Conservative and Opposition Members of the Committee feel that the Bill should be considered in a certain order and if the Government agree, the appropriate motion will be tabled. However, it is my understanding that the Government do not intend to table such a motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I hope that I can provoke the Under-Secretary to respond to my suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is utterly logical to consider clause 1 and schedule 1 together. The debates on clause 1 will refer to the works listed in schedule 1: the two go together. It is ridiculous to return to schedule 1 at the end of the Bill after we have spent a great deal of time discussing the works listed in clause 1. Would you consider adjourning the Committee, Mr. Winterton, to see whether the Under-Secretary is prepared to consider the matter or, if we proceed to the debate on amendments to clause 1, are we precluded from tabling a motion later to link clause 1 and schedule 1?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been helpful and constructive. In a moment or two I shall propose that we proceed with the amendments to clause 1. The Minister and the Government have heard what the hon. Gentleman has said. Perhaps it will be possible to table a motion that can be considered at our next sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. I know that the Government and the hon. Member for Torfaen (Mr. Murphy) have noted what he has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I call the first amendment, I remind the Committee, as I am bound to do, that there is a financial resolution on the Bill and that copies of it are available in the Committee Room. I also call attention to the fact that
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
adequate notice—this touches on the matter that we have discussed briefly—should be given to amendments. As a general rule I do not intend to call starred amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With reference to the point made by my hon. Friend the Minister for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, there are no amendments to schedule 1 so it does not appear on the amendment paper. I hope that we can discuss the question raised by my hon. Friend after this sitting because it is important that we debate clause 1 and schedule 1 together. Essentially, it is all about money; clause 1 rests on the costs of the projects under consideration in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be brief because I know that a number of my hon. Friends wish to speak before we finish this sitting. We are concerned to know why the expenditure has risen from £86 million to £112 million, or, excluding the alternative feeding grounds, to £106 million. We are told that the reason for the increase is inflation and that design changes have been recommended. In a written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West, the Secretary of State for Wales said that the design changes that accounted for the increase included: outer harbour dressing; additional fish pass requirements; changes to the way in which barrage meets land at Queen Alexandra dock; a change of embankment cross-section; and amendments to the design and the size of the then proposed feeding grounds of the Wentlooge lagoon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was only by chance that my hon. Friend and others saw that, in the first supplement of the 	<i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities the estimated cost was £86 million. By careful scrutiny of a later supplement of the 	<i>Official Journal</i> they noticed that that figure had risen to £112 million. I am not saying that the design changes that the Secretary of State outlined to my hon. Friend are unsatisfactory or unwanted. My anxiety concerns the way in which expenditure on the Cardiff bay barrage has been dealt with all along. Bearing in mind the extreme limitations put on local authorities in Wales—county councils and district councils—regarding revenue and capital expenditure, I suspect that no local authority would have got away with the enormous increases in capital costs that have been evident in relation to the development corporation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is fair to say that many people in Cardiff, or at least in my constituency, would maintain that, since the first advertisement of the barrage appeared in the 	<i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities, the £26 million inflation cost alone could have been used to refurbish every council home in Ely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend's point is well noted. My point is that the history of the costing of the project has been vague, and built, to use a maritime expression, on shifting sands. Almost from day to day different figures have appeared. There is a problem of accounting and accountability. The body mainly responsible for carrying out the project, the Cardiff Bay development corporation, is accountable to no one except the Secretary of State. That is a grave error in terms of financing. More technically, the accounting procedures themselves must be brought into question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 13 December 1990, the then Under-Secretary of State for Wales, Mr. Nicholas Bennett, wrote a long letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney in which he stated in detail why money was supposed to be spent on different measures. The overall expenditure amounted to £126 million. Just under a year later, in November 1991, in the debate on the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill money resolution, the figure was changed from £126 million to £152 million. I know that that debate took place on my 43rd birthday, but I do not think that that can have accounted for £25 millions worth of extra expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have heard, £547 million is now the overall cost of the Cardiff bay project. That figure breaks down as follows: £ 125 million for the barrage; £ 148 million for infrastructure sites; £152 million for improved access; £96 million for environmental improvements; and £25 million for "people-draw" facilities. That dreadful term means entertainment and leisure facilities that draw people into the district. One good thing will come out of the Committee if we can bury that expression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of that money, £335 million comes from the public sector; the remainder comes from the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been following my hon. Friend's argument. Which document did he read those figures from?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reading from 	<i>Hansard</i> of 25 November 1991. At the bottom of c. 728 the then Under-Secretary of State for Wales gave the breakdown of the £547 million, which is the overall cost of the barrage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not say that the expenditure is unnecessary—far from it, My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, Central (Mr. Owen Jones) made a clear case that unemployment levels in the capital city of Wales are as high, if not higher, than in parts of valley constituencies such as mine. We all agree on the general expenditure to reduce dereliction and build houses and roads and to ensure that the economy in the south of Cardiff is developed. My disagreement arises because the figures seem not to have been carefully scrutinised. We have been given different figures in different debates; that is what lies behind the amendments. We need a better idea of how the money is spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did the figure of £126 million, which was given as the cost of the barrage to my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney in December, increase to £152 million the following year? We need to know why the figures increase so dramatically. If the Standing Committee continued after the summer recess we might find another £10 million or £20 million in the total bill. That is not good costing or management and is bound to fuel speculation that the way in which the figures are estimated is both amateurish and wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment—perhaps the most critical one of all. The Opposition have little confidence in the figures and in the Government's state of preparation. The conventional test of parliamentary questions and letters is the way in which the Opposition try to elicit honest and clear responses—in this case, on the cost of the project and the reasons for the change in estimates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to give an example. We feel that things are taken out and put back in after the Government have decided what total cost to show. They then decide what components to use to fit the total. They do that rather than add up all the components honestly and openly to present a figure in the way that a Government should, especially when the debated is initiated in a Standing Committee, whose members have to do a job to feel justified in collecting their monthly salary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of our worries, by comparing financial memoranda. The November 1989 Bill was a major Bill. It was discussed in another place, then came before this House and fell in March or April 1991. As far as I know, the quality of information contained in financial memoranda for both private and public Bills has to abide by the same Standing Order. I believe that it is Standing Order No. 169. The financial memorandum to the Cardiff Bay Barrage Bill [	<i>Lords</i>], which was considered in November 1989, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The expenditure on construction of the proposed works is estimated at £82·2 million".</p></blockquote>
It then estimates the cost of the accompanying land at £2·5 million. We thus arrive at the figure of £85 million given by my hon. Friends the Members for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney and for Torfaen. The 1989 Bill describes how the total is made up of works to which the Bill refers in clause 17. The schedules to the 1989 Bill were short, but the Bill was long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend talks, rightly and appropriately, about the private Bill. Unfortunately, none of us can follow the text. Does the Minister have a copy before him? He must follow the argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister has a copy of that Bill. I am happy to pass him my copy if he is unable to obtain one by the time I have finished referring to the contrast between the two Bills and how they differ in the information upon which they ask us to judge in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 17 in part III of the 1989 Bill refers to five works, which are the barrage, the Penarth head foreshore reclamation works, the breasting dolphins, the tidal lagoon and the collector drain attached to the lagoon. The outer harbour is missing from that list.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The financial memorandum to the present Bill, or Bill 6, in the form that it took on Second Reading, states on page iv:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The cost of constructing the barrage and associated works is estimated at £113 million".</p></blockquote>
At that stage, land acquisition was still estimated at £2·5 million. Either the land had already been bought or the Government did not bother to reconsider that figure. It is such a small figure that we shall not quibble about whether it should have been inflation-proofed. Let us compare the two financial memoranda and the jump from £82·5 million to £113 million in the two years from November 1989 to November 1991. It is an increase of 30 per cent. but only if the November 1991 Bill includes the same components as the November 1989 measure.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
I now refer to the famous letter, about which we all preach sermons on Sunday mornings, from Nicholas Bennett, the former Under-Secretary of State for Wales, to my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. We are almost totally dependent on the annexes at the back of the 10-page letter. They are the nearest thing that we have to a balance sheet for the Bill, although it is almost two years out of date. I hope that the Minister will reconsider his decision not to provide an up-dated version of the financial estimate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Annexe B explains that the financial memorandum of the 1991 Bill did not include the Penarth head foreshore works and that the £113 million does not include reference to work No. 2 in the list of five in the original private Bill. As a result, we do not know how the £113 million figure would be updated to include work No. 2, which was referred to also in the list of six works in schedule 1 of the November 1991 version. The May version contained a list of four works, as the Select Committee omitted works Nos. 5 and 6—in connection with the Wentlooge lagoon and the attendant collector drain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must make a clear statement of his willingness to place before the Committee details of the four works that remain. In addition, when he described, in response to a question that I asked him during the debate on the sittings motion, what the Government proposed to do to reach an arrangement by private treaty in respect of mitigation works, the Minister made it clear that such works would be undertaken. It may emerge as the Bill progresses that such mitigation works will not be additional to the four works outlined in schedule 1. However, I think that the Minister realises that reference to mitigation works means that the Bill will have to be amended, or at least that the Government must report to the House on the additional expenditure that will be incurred. The Bill lists the works to be undertaken—the barrage, the foreshore works, the outer or yachting harbour attached to the barrage at the Penarth end, and the breasting dolphins that are fixed to the Cardiff end. Schedule 1 does not include the Wentlooge lagoon or the collector drain, but, if those mitigating works are undertaken, Parliament will have to account for the money spent on them. The Minister will then have to make clear how much such works will cost. Obviously, the Minister cannot give away too many details now. In purchasing by private treaty, he will not want to give his hand away and say, "We'll spend up to 10 million quid". That might cause the odd landowner to think that he could make a quick profit. Opposition Members would be happy to accept an undertaking from the Minister that he will give the House an actual figure at a later stage, when the money has been spent on land acquisition and when he has been able to add in the engineering costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am following the very important unravelling by my hon. Friend of the respective costs, and wonder whether he has resolved the following conundrum. Rightly, he has pointed out that annex B to the famous letter of December 1990 did not include in the estimated costs a figure for work No. 2. Strangely, however, the figure including land acquisition came to £113 million. Subsequently, when the then Minister came to discuss the money resolution for the Bill on 25 Novmeber 1991—the reference can be found at the top of column 728 in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<i>Official Report</i> for that date—he said that all the main works in schedule 1 would cost £113 million, and that land acquisition would requre an additional £2·5 million. Does that mean that the standard £2·5 million for land acquisition is also the cost of work No. 2? It is curious that the figures should have remained identical at £113 million, even though annex B of the letter excludes work No. 2 from the costs, whereas it is included in the money resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That just shows the struggle that we will have resolving this problem, and it reinforces my earlier point that we should take schedule 1 with clause 1.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Morgan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney has drawn the Committee's attention to the curiously coincidental nature of the figures. They keep popping up but meaning different things. The figure of £113 million seems to have a strange, totemic significance for the Welsh Office and the Cardiff Bay development corporation. Originally, at November 1988 prices, it covered the total cost of the barrage package, inclusive of works on sewerage, land acquisition and the cost of oxygenation of water under the water quality management objectives. That £113 million was the all-up cost under the private Bill, but the Government Bill in November 1991, which was dealt with on Second Reading by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, the former hon. Member for Pembroke, Nicholas Bennett, did not give that figure for the total package. That figure was simply the cost of the works—the six items of physical expenditure on civil engineering. So the figure no longer includes the cost of sewer diversions, water quality expenditure or the ground water compensation works, which is the biggest interest of all to my constituents and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff Central. Those extra costs added another £37 million. Furthermore, as far as we can tell, the cost of the foreshore reclamation works in Penarth appear to have disappeared. They are listed in the schedule, but they do not appear to be costed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can intervene to clarify how the figure has been arrived at. On what is it based? Does it include the cost of all four works listed in the schedule, plus or minus an allowance for the extras such as the ground water compensation and the water quality protection works that have taken the cost from £113 million? Does it include the two works that have now been eliminated by the Select Committee's proceedings on the Wentlooge? That takes us to £ 152 million, but is nowhere near the cost of the barrage and allied works. It is merely a snapshot estimate based on late 1990 figures and not an outturn estimate. In no way is it comparable with £147·7 million, which was the figure to which Nick Bennett referred in his letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, although it was the figure given by his predecessor, Ian Grist, when he was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A figure of well over £200 million would appear to be the actual outturn cost—the cost of the barrage if built. The outturn estimate given by Ian Grist, which is the one that we are really interested in, was £147·7 million and was based on 1990 figures but it made an allowance for inflation by a 1991–92 start date and a four-and-a-half-year construction period. We are no longer at that stage, but if the Government made an assumption on the date when the Cardiff Bay development corporation might be ready to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
start, what would be a comparable figure? I should be amazed if it were less than £200 million, bearing in mind that two years have elapsed and that we are looking ahead for four-and-a-half years. I shall be happy to be corrected. I am trying to stimulate the Minister into coming clean and giving us a real-terms estimate for 1993 expenditure at 1993 prices, 1994 expenditure at 1994 prices and so on to the putative ending of construction four-and-a-half years after the start date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to the advertisement in the 	<i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities that is the way in which estimates were supposed to be given under the public procurement Acts. The November 1990 advertisement in the 	<i>Official Journal</i> gave a figure of £86 million for the project, which was due to start in early 1992 and last for four and a half years. Clearly, that figure died with the private Bill. However, the second advertisement in the supplement to the 	<i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities which was published two weeks ago and therefore must be up-to-date, gives no start date, although the construction period is still quoted as being four and a half years. The out-turn estimate to compare with £147.7 million has been avoided. The Government cannot say that it cannot be done, because it was done by the Minister's predecessor but two. I hope that the Minister will come up with similar figures. The best thing would be if he could tell us by Thursday the estimated cost of the four separate works listed in schedule 1 as given in annex A of the letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney in November 1988. Let us say there was inflation in the following two years and by 1990 there was a pre-costing exercise. The latest construction estimates for 1992 are up to two months behind. I obtained some from the Library. The Property Services Agency does the work for building and civil engineering companies. It is not that difficult to get inflation estimates. The Library is willing to tell me the PSA inflation figures for cement, tarmac, bricks, labour and supervision of labour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
April 1992 estimates are available, so the Government should at least provide the Committee with up-to-date costings of the four works specified in schedule 1. They should then cover other elements that are part of the barrage package such as the diversion of the sewers and the oxygenation of water. The extra elements are not listed in schedule 1, but without them the barrage cannot be built to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will add to their list of estimates in case the Committee has to consider the reinstatement of mitigation works even if they are different from what was contained in the November 1991 Bill. We are happy to be flexible,but we cannot proceed unless the Minister is open about the likely costs. On Second Reading in November 1991, £5.7 million-worth expenditure was envisaged. That has been taken out on the recommendation of the Select Committee, in breach of the undertakings given by the Under-Secretary of State to the Countryside Council for Wales in return for that council's not petitioning against the Bill or by way of a second House undertaking. The council will ask about mitigation works, so a figure must be put on them. If the Government are unwilling to do that, we can only think that they want to hide the truth, that they have something worth hiding and that they do not want to give us an updated, inflation-proofed, reasonable estimate of the true cost of what we are being asked to approve today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
Our plea is simple. It may require the Minister coming to the Committee on Thursday with a paper on the basis of the letter written by Nicholas Bennett to my hon. Friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney. Is the Minister willing to undertake to come forward with that information in the next 48 hours? The Committee's proceedings will be difficult if the Welsh Office continues to give the impression that it has something to hide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rowlands</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment. I should have thought that it would appeal to Conservative Members, because it is an expenditure-capping amendment. It would cap the total cost of the barrage. We have tabled the amendment for the reason given by my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West—that we already have a labyrinth of figures—and also because of the inexorable rise in costs. That gives us no confidence that we have any idea what the ultimate outturn costs of the scheme will be. The costs will come out of the same budget from which we are all campaigning for expenditure for other projects. Therefore, we fear that money will be diverted to pay for an expanding scheme with increasing financial consequences, which will be out of the financial control and detailed scrutiny of the Welsh Office.

The history of the debate is important. My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) was right to give the Under-Secretary a gentle warning that as this Bill has been a jinx on two previous Under-Secretaries who have come and gone during the course of its proceedings, he might be the third. It was the remarks of Mr. Ian Grist when he was Under-Secretary that sent the alarm bells ringing for me. Those remarks were quoted in the famous letter to me from Mr. Nicholas Bennett dated 13 December 1990. I hope that you, Mr. Winterton, have a copy of that letter, which has become the standard text from which we all work.

In that letter Mr. Grist is quoted as saying on Second Reading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'we will ensure that sufficient funding will be made available to enable the Corporation to carry through its task'."</p></blockquote>
We saw that as an open-ended blank cheque for the scheme. There was no suggestion but that whatever the Cardiff Bay development corporation came forward with to build the barrage, the Welsh Office would fund it. There was no idea that a moment would come when the cost of the barrage would outweigh its advantages; the Under-Secretary had made an astonishing statement, offering an open blank cheque.

Those of us who had been around a long time knew that, particularly in the current economic climate, such a statement was surely impossible to sustain. The letter of 13 December was written partly to assuage our fears that a blank cheque had been signed. The woolliness and ambivalence in the letter has prompted us to try to fix a meaningful cap on the expenditure that will occur as a result of the clause. The letter and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West said, the subsequent confusions over the detailed finances of the scheme, with its escalating costs, have prompted us to try to cap the expenditure that will be incurred from the clause and the Bill.

Annex A of the letter of 13 December 1990 outlines a list of the works in clause 17 of the private Bill. Whereas the private Bill listed the works in a clause, this public Bill describes them in Schedule 1. That goes back to the procedural point that I made earlier about the need to consider that Schedule together with clause 1. Annex A of

the letter costs Work No. 1 at £68.89 million, Work No. 2 at £7.60 million, No. 3 at £2.12 million, No. 4—the tidal lagoon—at £3.25 million and No. 5 at £0.37 million. That adds up to £82.23 million which, plus the acquisition of lands, means a total of £84.78 million. That £85 million became the standard figure and is the reference point for all calculations, including amendment No. 71. That is the base from which not just ourselves, but the Under-Secretary and the Welsh Office operated.

However, there is confusion even within the terms of one letter. Annex B of the letter lists an update of the costs of the original figures, but for some reason leaves out Work No. 2. There is a footnote and I should be grateful if the Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
