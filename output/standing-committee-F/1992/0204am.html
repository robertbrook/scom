<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New clause 8 will correct a small anomaly and goes a small way towards the proposals sought by new clause 11 that has been tabled by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith). I shall explain why I consider that new clause 8 is more preferable than the hon. Gentleman's new clause.<br><br>
New clause 8 will rectify an anomaly in compensation for employees who have been unfairly dismissed and whose employers fail to comply with industrial tribunal orders to reinstate or re-engage them. The anomaly means that in a small number of cases there may be a financial incentive for employers to disregard the order made by the tribunal.<br><br>
When an industrial tribunal decides that an employee has been unfairly dismissed, it may order that the employee be reinstated, or re-engaged to do a similar job. In doing that, it will specify an amount payable by the employer in respect of benefits and arrears of pay that would normally have been due to the employee in the period between his dismissal and his reinstatement or re-engagement, had he not been dismissed. In addition, a re-engagement order will also specify the remuneration for the new job.<br><br>
The amount payable by the employer is not subject to any limits and if the employee were on a high salary, it could be considerable.<br><br>
If the employer re-employs the individual, but otherwise only partly complies with the order, the industrial tribunal may make an award of compensation having regard to the loss sustained by the complainant as a result of the failure to comply fully with the order. If the employer does not comply with an order, the tribunal may make a basic and compensatory award as in ordinary cases of unfair dismissal, plus an additional award, unless the employer can satisfy the tribunal that it was not practicable to comply with the order.<br><br>
All the awards made in circumstances when the employer does not comply fully or at all with a tribunal order are subject to a monetary unit. As a result, in a few cases the employer could end up paying less than if he or she had fully complied with the original order.<br><br>
That situation, although it arises infrequently, is clearly unsatisfactory, providing, as it does, an unintended incentive for employers to flout the authority of the industrial tribunals. As hon. Members who follow the law reports will recall, it has attracted criticism in the courts in the case of O'Laoire <i>v.</i> Jackel, where the then Master of the Rolls drew attention to it. The amendment rectifies the anomaly by giving the industrial tribunal new powers to exceed the normal compensation limits in such eases, so that the total compensation awarded, excluding the basic award, can equal the arrears of the pay element of the original award with which the employer has refused to comply.<br><br>
The clause will go some of the way towards meeting the points that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden also wants to be covered. It will deal with a minority of cases, and the Bill gives us the opportunity to implement such an important change. I am sure that it will be welcomed by the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members welcome the slight changes that the new clause will make. It does not, however, deal with the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0756">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 733</span>
basic problem that would be met by new clause 11. The Minister said that new clause 8 will deal with a small anomaly that does not occur very often. The problem is that when an industrial tribunal has ordered reinstatement, no statutory onus is placed on the employer to comply with the order—the employer can ignore it. Many reasons can be given under the Act for not enforcing a section 69 order. If an employer wants rid of someone, he can get rid of them, attend an unfair dismissal hearing, accept that the dismissal was unfair, receive and order to reinstate which he does not follow, and then pay compensation. Some employers are quite prepared to do that.<br><br>
The Minister said that the new clause addressed a "small anomaly". I do not know the figures, but it is not a small anomaly to lose a job unfairly and not to get it back. Financial compensation is no substitute for regaining a job. One case is that of Peter Hutton, who was a technician for the Royal Mail in Plymouth until he was sacked for insubordination in December 1991. The case came before an industrial appeal tribunal, which found that his manager had engineered the crisis that led to his dismissal and that he had been unfairly dismissed. Furthermore, it found that spurious allegations had been made against him. It ordered his re-engagement in a suitable job with the Post Office elsewhere in the south-west of England or south Wales. The tribunal found:
<br><blockquote><p>"He is very highly qualified … Almost anything in the motor trade would be within his capabilities and in the Post Office there is a considerable fleet of motor vehicles."</p></blockquote>
He was also awarded £6,700 for loss of eanings.<br><br>
However, the Royal Mail said that it was "unable to comply"—unable to employ him—and he received a compensatory award of £12,000. That is barely a year's wages, and just not good enough. People who are unfairly dismissed need to be reinstated. I know that under section 69 there are various reasons for that not to occur, but that is taken into consideration by the industrial tribunal before it makes its decision. If it orders reinstatement, that order ought to be complied with.<br><br>
One sanction regarding which we seek to ensure compliance is an increase in the amount of compensation. That is the purpose of our new clause, which would increase the relevant periods from 26 to 52 weeks and from 52 to 78 weeks. That financial constraint on the employer would make it more likely that he or she would accept the individual back. The problem with industrial tribunals—good as they are—is that they have no power to enforce reinstatement. That is what new clause 11 seeks to provide. Although we welcome the Government's new clause, it does not go far enough.</span></p>

New clause 9</div> <!-- clause -->
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
FEES FOR EXERCISE OF FUNCTIONS BY ACAS</div> <!-- title -->
<p>" . After section 251 of the 1992 Act there shall be inserted the following section—
<br><blockquote><p>'Fees for exercise of functions by ACAS.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>251A.—(1) ACAS may, in any case in which it thinks appropriate to do so, but subject to any directions under subsection (2) below, charge a fee for exercising a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
function in relation to any person.
<ol>
<li>The Secretary of State may direct ACAS to charge fees, in accordance with the direction, for exercising any function specified in the direction, but the Secretary of State shall not give a direction under this subsection without consulting ACAS.</li>
<li>A direction under subsection (2) above may require ACAS to charge fees in respect of the exercise of a function only in specified descriptions of case.</li>
<li>A direction under subsection (2) above shall specify whether fees are to be charged in respect of the exercise of any specified function—</li>
<ol>
<li>at the full economic cost level, or</li>
<li>at a level less than the full economic cost but not less than a specified proportion or percentage of the full economic cost.</li>
</ol>
<li>Where a direction requires fees to be charged at the full economic cost level ACAS shall fix the fee for the case at an amount estimated to be sufficient to cover the administrative costs of ACAS of exercising the function including an appropriate sum in respect of general staff costs and overheads.</li>
<li>Where a direction requires fees to be charged at a level less than the full economic cost ACAS shall fix the fee for the case at such amount, not being less than the proportion or percentage of the full economic cost specified under subsection (4)(b) above, as it thinks appropriate.</li>
<li>No liability to pay a fee charged under this section shall arise on the part of any person, in a case where that person had made no request for the function to be exercised, unless ACAS has notified that person that a fee may or will be charged.</li>
<li>For the purposes of this section—</li>
<ol>
<li>a function is exercised 'in relation to' a person who avails himself of the benefit of its exercise, whether or not he requested its exercise and whether the function is such as to be exercisable in relation to particular persons only or in relation to persons generally; and</li>
<li>where a function is exercised in relation to two or more persons the fee chargeable for its exercise shall be apportioned among them as ACAS thinks appropriate.'.".—[<i>Mr. Michael Forsyth.</i>]</li></ol></ol></p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
New clause 9 gives effect to the provisions of charging for the services of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. With clause 32, it implements our reforms to the statutory framework of ACAS. Our legislative changes modify and update the existing framework set out in the 1992 Act, but do not overturn it. They will enable ACAS to continue to make an effective contribution to the future improvement of industrial relations.<br><br>
The clause has two main elements. Subsection (1) will enable—I stress that word—ACAS to charge for its services. The Committee will recall that our amendments to clause 32 remove the prohibition against charging for advisory work, but without a power to charge and a clear framework for doing so there could still be obstacles and uncertainties. Subsection (1) remedies that deficiency by giving ACAS the express power to charge a fee
<br><blockquote><p>"In any case in which it thinks it appropriate to do so".</p></blockquote>
The second, at subsection (2), gives the Secretary of State for Employment a reserve power to require ACAS to charge for a specified service. Subsections (3) to (8) set
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0757">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 735</span>
out how that power would be exercised. The Secretary of State can require a fee to be charged at the full economic cost of the service in question, or at a specified proportion of the full economic cost.<br><br>
The power to enable ACAS to charge allows it to offset the costs of certain services, if it so chooses. The power does not apply to conciliation in tribunal cases. ACAS has made it clear that it would be likely to take advantage of this provision to charge in certain cases—for some publications and events, for example. This year, ACAS will cost over £22 million. The taxpayer meets that cost and we would be failing in our duty to the taxpayer if we did not put in place mechanisms to allow at least some of those costs to be recovered from those who benefit from the service in question.<br><br>
We have no current plans to use the reserve power to require ACAS to charge for a service, but in the light of the heavy demand for its services, continuing need to bear down on all aspects of public expenditure, and ACAS's independence from ministerial control, we believe that it is right to take such a power as a reserve measure.<br><br>
The new clause reflects a pragmatic approach to the issue of charging. We recognise that charging can be a sensitive issue for ACAS and may not be appropriate for all its services. But it is clearly right for ACAS to charge in circumstances where it is sensible to do so. The new clause will give clear powers to enable this to happen and I commend it to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The new clause represents a fairly serious intrusion by the Government into the affairs of ACAS and it does not welcome it. At our previous sitting, the Under-Secretary tried to convey the impression that that is welcomed by ACAS but I shall show that it is not. Its welcome is strictly limited to a power to charge for some publications. The whole principle and thrust of the new clause is rejected by ACAS.<br><br>
The Minister of State was not present on Tuesday when we spent a long time discussing sophistry and the nice phrases turned out by the Under-Secretary, some of which we are hearing again. I especially liked the phrase "no current plans" which means: "Not at the moment, but you can bet your bottom dollar that when everyone has forgotten about it we will do so". The Minister tripped out the words that he "had no current plans" to charge for various functions. We can be assured that, given the opportunity, the Government will do so.<br><br>
The basis for the new clause is the Government's claim that they want to save taxpayers' money and that it has nothing to do with ACAS or the rights of individuals. It is all about their great championship of taxpayers and they say that they would be failing in their duty if they did not protect them by obliging ACAS to make charges. We are asked, however, to ignore the fact that the Government stuffed £4 billion down the drain in trying to prop up the pound and another £14 billion on the poll tax.<br><br>
Another of the Minister's phrases was that it is "just an enabling power" which the Government "have no current plans" to use.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must not mislead the Committee. I said that ACAS wished to have the opportunity to charge and that the provisions would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
enable it to do so. I also said that we had no plans to use the reserve power of direction to charge which is included in the Bill.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that semi-clarification from the Minister who tries, again, not to mislead the Committee but who leaves unanswered all the points that I have made.<br><br>
The claim is that ACAS wishes to have the power to charge, but ACAS did not ask the Government for that power. It was the Government's idea—although, of course, ACAS was consulted. I shall read some of the correspondence, to parts of which I have already referred.<br><br>
The second paragraph of the letter dated 13 January from Sir Douglas Smith of ACAS to the Secretary of State begins:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Council is deeply dismayed to learn that you propose to seek a power of direction concerning ACAS's activities, notwithstanding that this would be limited to the possibility of requiring it to charge for specified services and you have no current plans to exercise such a power.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Since its establishment in 1974, ACAS has been entirely free from the possibility of Ministerial direction of any kind. This has been the essential feature of its independence and the foundation of its proven impartiality with which it wins the widespread public acceptability of all its services. A reserve power could well be regarded as a continuing threat to seek to influence or govern the ways in which ACAS exercises all or any of its statutory duties so as to ensure they are peformed in ways preferred by Ministers."</p></blockquote>
That is not mealy-mouthed civil service-speak. Most of us could get the message that ACAS does not like what is happening. The letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"This would bite deeply into the very concept of independence, and would greatly diminish the authority of the Council itself. The Council finds such considerations as are adduced in the Department's letter for the need for a reserve power wholly unconvincing."</p></blockquote>
ACAS does not suggest that there might be a case for such a power, or that it sees the point of introducing one, because it is only a reserve power and will not be used. ACAS is up-front about its view. The letter continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"It also does not see the need for the further amendment to be proposed to ACAS's statutory terms of reference."</p></blockquote>
There is more:
<br><blockquote><p>"As its response to the review made clear, the Council was content that the total prohibition on charging should be lifted and suggested a reformulation of Section 213 of the 1992 Consolidation Act which, among other things, would secure such a change."</p></blockquote>
Again, that is the basis for the Minister's impression that ACAS agrees with the Government that there are no problems and that all is rosy. In fact, it has always been ACAS's opinion that what the Minister wants could be achieved without the new clause.<br><br>
I shall skip some of the letter and read the third last paragraph:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Council is also unclear whether you are accepting two very important specific recommendations in the report on the first stage of the review. The first was that collective conciliation should continue to be publicly funded and available without charge; the second that individual conciliation should remain a fully publicly funded service and charging for it would not make sense. The Council readily endorse these recommendations and the reasons for them. It would welcome your assurance that you too have accepted them."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to give us those assurances this morning: first, that collective conciliation should continue to be publicly funded and available without charge and,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0758">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 737</span>
secondly, that individual conciliation should remain a fully publicly funded service. I should be grateful for the Minister's comments.<br><br>
The Secretary of State replied to that letter. Unlike ACAS's letter, which was blunt and to the point—we do not like the idea, drop it, it is nonsense—the Secretary of State replied in the usual civil service-speak. She suggested that she had no plans to exercise the reserve powers bearing down on all aspects of public expenditure. Her letter did not refer to flexibility, customer satisfaction and time-limited, targeted consultation. However, the Secretary of State did accept—for I see that a provision has been included in the new clause—that the Government would not exercise the reserve powers without consulting ACAS.<br><br>
Notwithstanding the letter from the Secretary of State, ACAS replied on 28 January in a shorter letter of three paragraphs, but no less punchy, which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Council was both deeply disappointed and disturbed that you have felt unable to accept its unanimous representations on this issue. The Council maintains its view that the power of direction is unnecessary and, much more importantly, that it challenges the independence of ACAS and seriously diminishes the authority and responsibility of the council itself. The Council was most anxious that you knew the strength of its views."</p></blockquote>
That puts the new clause in perspective.<br><br>
The new clause is not welcomed by ACAS. It realises that it will cause problems and that it will infringe on ACAS's independence and impartiality. The Minister suggests that the new clause would simply be a method of charging for the latest glossy booklet. The Government maintain that that should be done by amending the legislation. The new clause is unnecessary. Therefore, we shall oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has stressed the pragmatic purpose behind the new clause. As he was speaking I could not help but think back to our debate about ACAS on Tuesday. The Minister has stressed that the new clause would enable ACAS to charge for its services. He thinks that there may be circumstances in which ACAS would want to do that. My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has made it clear that the new clause would also enable the Secretary of State to direct ACAS to charge for its services. The Secretary of State has given us to understand that there are no "current plans" to do that.<br><br>
When might "current plans" change? Some pointers may be found in my speech during Tuesday's debate, when I listed the functions of ACAS, as written down in legislation, that are being deleted by the Bill. Those functions include:
<br><blockquote><p>"recognition of trade unions by employers, machinery for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment, joint consultation, procedures for avoiding incessant disputes and workers' grievances, questions relating to communication between employers and workers, facilities for officials of trade unions, procedures relating to the termination of employment, disciplinary matters, manpower planning, labour turnover and absenteeism, recruitment, retention, promotion and vocational training of workers, payment systems, including job evaluation and equal pay."—[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 2 February 1993; c.681]</p></blockquote>
Unless I have misread the Government's intention in introducing their amendments on Tuesday, they intend, by legislation, to delete those functions from the terms of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
reference of ACAS. They say that ACAS is not precluded from doing anything that it wants because, of course, it is an independent body. However, by deleting those functions from the terms of reference, the Government will have downgraded those aspects of ACAS's work.<br><br>
Is not it likely that, in the none-too-distant future, the Government will use their discretion and say to ACAS, "If you want to provide those services, they are not in your terms of reference under statute, so we want you to charge for them." That would massively reduce the effectiveness and usefulness of ACAS as an independent body that provides a vital service in improving industrial relations. It could also lead to a disincentive to use ACAS. If that is the case, will the Government turn round, perhaps in a few years time, and say, "Clearly ACAS is not doing its job. Nobody is using it any more. Do we really need it?"? The very body that was set up, with all-party support, as an independent, public body to offer impartial advice and to help to improve industrial relations, will then be swept away. Shall we ever be able to discover when it was swept away? No, we shall not, because, as in similar cases, it will happen incrementally. First, the Government clipped ACAS's wings by reducing and removing items from its specific terms of reference. The Government are now trying to give themselves reserve powers to direct ACAS to charge. At the end of the day, the Government will sweep it away altogether because it is not doing its job. That is the Government's agenda.<br><br>
I am aware of only one organisation that has exerted pressure to change ACAS in the way proposed. On Tuesday, I quoted the Policy Studies Institute. Its concern was that ACAS has, in effect, been required to promote policies wholly out of tune with those of the Conservative Government, and that is why the functions of ACAS need to be changed. I mentioned on Tuesday that the Government have not denied that. They do not object to ACAS because it is ineffective, but because it might be acting in a way that is not approved of by the Government. That is why ACAS is so worried about the proposals. ACAS agrees that there might be a small range of publications for which it would be appropriate to charge. It does not object to that. Indeed, it has told the Minister that that is one thing it might favour. ACAS might be regretting that because the Minister has used its willingness to charge for a limited range of publications as an endorsement of the principal of charging.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden made it clear that that is ACAS's view on the reserve power that Ministers are taking for themselves. ACAS believes that its independence might be swept away by the proposal. I have not heard a substantial argument from the Minister about why the proposal is justified. The Minister said that ACAS costs £22 million a year. Are the Government suggesting, and are they prepared to go on record as saying, that the cost of £22 million a year is too great for them? Is that too much to pay for an independent service that improves industrial relations?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden gave a number of examples of the Government having been prepared to fritter away millions and millions of pounds, far more than £22 million, to no effect. Yet, somehow, when it comes to improving industrial relations they are not prepared to spend £22 million.<br><br>
It is an insidious and unnecessary new clause. It is not supported by anyone except the Government and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0759">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 739</span>
people who responded to their consultation exercise with the view that ACAS differs from Conservative party principles. I hope that hon. Members will reject the new clause. I also hope that people outside this place realise what is going on. The clipping of ACAS's wings has not received much publicity. What the Government are trying to do speaks volumes about their agenda for industrial relations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was checking up on a point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden). Uncharacteristically, the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden is making a bit of a meal out of this. Whether and what services the power to charge should apply to would be a matter for the ACAS council.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is simply a matter for ACAS, why did not the Government take ACAS's advice and reformulate section 213 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992? I could suggest a few amendments that would have dealt with ACAS's role. Why not accept the advice of ACAS? Why go for this extensive new clause which takes considerable reserve powers?</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is true that the new clause would take a reserve power to direct ACAS to charge for particular services. I have made clear that we have no plans to use that power—I am relying on the good sense of the ACAS council to examine its operations and to decide where it would be appropriate to improve its income through charging.<br><br>
The argument that charging compromises the independence of ACAS is bizarre. ACAS depends for funding on the Government, who have no money other than what they take from the taxpayer and, increasingly, borrow, to cover commitments. Opposition Members are quick to mention the size of the deficit but they always resist measures that would reduce demand on public expenditure.<br><br>
ACAS has suggested that it would like to be able to charge for services such as publications and conferences. Why should the taxpayer pay for those services? Why should funds, which would otherwise be available for the health service and education, be used for ACAS if there is an opportunity to charge? The ability to charge should be accepted by all members of the Committee. I am surprised that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden considers that ability a threat to independence. If ACAS can improve its finances by charging the economic cost of the services that it provides, that enhances its independence as it gives it an additional source of income.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister think that ACAS considers that the Bill represents a threat to its independence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because, unlike Opposition Members, ACAS did not muddle the two issues of charging and the powers of direction that are included in the Bill. I think that that is a fair assessment. The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden seems to have made a more detailed study of the correspondence between my
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 740</span>
Department and ACAS than I have had the opportunity to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be helpful if the Minister studied the correspondence? He would then know what ACAS thought, instead of having to get the information second hand from me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have not had to rely entirely on receiving information second hand from the hon. Gentleman. I saw the correspondence as it arrived during January although I have not collected a full set to study it carefully, as the hon. Gentleman has. One wonders from where on earth he could have got the correspondence. Perhaps he could tell the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I have a copy, it suggests that ACAS thinks more of our opinions than it does of the Government's.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is correct, as I am sure he is not, that places a big question mark over ACAS's judgment. That is not what I wish to do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Spellar <span class='memberconstituency'>(Warley, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister implying that he thinks that that important correspondence should have been kept from Opposition members?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that it is interesting that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden refuses to say how he came by the correspondence. I shall happily give way if he wants to tell the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot remember.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I always feel that the hon. Gentleman is frank and honest with the Committee and I am sorry to hear of his memory failure.<br><br>
I have no objection to the correspondence being available to the hon. Gentleman—it sets out the arguments clearly. At the end of the day, the Government are responsible for the taxpayers' money. It would be wrong, in making the changes, not to allow for a power of direction that tried to protect the interests of the taxpayer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Antrim, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the cost to the taxpayer of services provided by ACAS. Has ACAS costed the services it provides to clients, and has any Government Department assessed the overall benefit and savings that are effected by ACAS's expenditure?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All bodies are subject to review from time to time. One consideration that will be applied is tied money. ACAS costs £22 million and it is Ministers' responsibility to satisfy themselves that that represents value for money. It is part of the process of Government to ensure that it is value for money. Internal costing and pricing within ACAS does not come under my responsibility, because ACAS is independent. It is an important point, and I shall ensure that it is raised with the Chairman of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.<br><br>
One benefit of privatisation—which is not on the agenda for ACAS—and of competitive tendering is that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0760">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 741</span>
they have forced many organisations that hitherto had no idea of the costs of running their organisations to have effective costing systems. One can make choices only when those systems are in place. The hon. Member for Antrim, East (Mr. Beggs) is right to emphasise to the Committee that it is not just a matter of adding up the costs; the benefits must also be looked at.<br><br>
Following the Prime Minister's seminar on deregulation this week, the Government have made it clear that in future all measures will require a compliance assessment and an indication of the benefits that accrue on the other side of the balance sheet. That is a great step forward and the hon. Member for Antrim, East is right to remind the Committee to look at both sides and of the importance of the work done by ACAS.<br><br>
This progressive measure will allow ACAS to operate as a modern organisation seeking to have value for money for the taxpayer. I have every confidence that the ACAS Council will take advantage of it and that the powers of direction about which Opposition Members have been concerned will not prove to be necessary. If they are necessary, something will have gone badly wrong with the ACAS Council. There is nothing in ACAS's history to suggest that that might happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew Miller <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ellesmere Port and Neston)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sat quietly through the beginning of the debate because I was curious to hear the Minister of State's opening words when, on the road to Damascus, he was converted to pragmatism—an interesting new word in his language. It contrasts starkly with some of the dogma that we heard in earlier debates.<br><br>
I read with some amusement in col. 625 of the Committee <i>Hansard</i> his repsonse to my suggestion that he should read Lord Gilmour's book "Dancing with Dogma". He said he "would rather not". The conversion to pragmatism is welcome, but it makes me suspicious. The Minister has yet to persuade me that the important point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield on the potential disincentive will not result from the powers exercised. Furthermore, he has yet to persuade me of his true motives, if he has nothing up his sleeve in respect of the services for which ACAS could charge.<br><br>
ACAS is recognised by both sides of the Committee as a highly respected organisation. It creates a valuable buffer in potential conflicts in industry. The hon. Member for Antrim, East made an important point when he asked the Minister whether anyone had tried to calculate what the annual expenditure of £23 million showed on the plus side of the balance sheet in terms of advantages to industry.<br><br>
I assume that the Minister would agree that the function of Government is to create the framework for all of us in society, including manufacturing industry, to operate efficiently and effectively and in a fair and equitable way. As part of that process, the ACAS council was set up several years ago with the consent of both sides of the House. Now the Government seem to be creating the potential for the disincentive to which my hon. Friend the Member for Northfield referred to creep into the equation. That must adversely affect the balance sheet.<br><br>
Against that background, the apparent conversion to a more pragmatic view of life arouses my suspicion. The Committee has not been told in clear-cut terms what the Minister's motives are in tabling the new clause. If he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 742</span>
envisages that charges could be introduced for specific services, he should say so. If he envisages absolute limits, he should say so.<br><br>
From my experience of dealing with ACAS, I cannot see how any service currently provided—individual or collective conciliation, general advice in industrial relations, or arbitration—would benefit from potential charges. There may be a short-term cash flow benefit in respect of the £23 million, but the chances are that the disincentive that creeps in would have a downside on the balance sheet of the national economy and would disadvantage industry—employers and employees alike.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not deal with my initial suggestion that the Government should accept the recommendation from ACAS that section 213 should be changed. Moreover, ACAS sought two assurances—that collective conciliation would continue to be publicly funded and available without charge and that individual conciliation would remain a pure publicly funded service, as charging for it would not make sense. Can the Minister reassure us that that will remain the case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that there is an express prohibition on charging for individual conciliation. It would be for the ACAS council to decide the areas where it would be appropriate to charge. We have made it clear that we have no plans to use the power of direction at present.<br><br>
On the hon. Gentleman's second point—why we do not accept the suggested changes to the 1992 Act—we have done so. That change removes the prohibition on charging. The advice is that the new clause is necessary so that ACAS has a clear statutory right to introduce charges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: ACAS did not want the new clause. It thought that the matter would be dealt with under section 213. The Minister said that there was an absolute prohibition on charging for individual conciliations, which will continue. Whether collective conciliation will be charged for is a matter for ACAS; the Government have no current plans on the matter, but watch this space.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can help the hon. Gentleman a little further. We held a review—I am not sure whether he has a copy of it and has had a chance to study it; he is looking suitably inscrutable—which concluded, I think, that charging for collective conciliation would be inappropriate.</span></p>
<p>11.15am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the Minister is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have accepted that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister about individual conciliation? What he just said to my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden seemed to be different from what he said earlier. As I understood it, he said earlier that there could be no charges for individual conciliation in cases that would otherwise have gone to an industrial tribunal. That would greatly limit the number of individual cases on which charging would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0761">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 743</span>
prohibited. However, the Minister said just now that there was express provision prohibiting without qualification charging for individual cases. Which is right?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Individual conciliation relates to industrial tribunal cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I clarify that? The current role of ACAS does not preclude an individual employee and employer seeking the services of ACAS to solve a problem between them. A part-time worker who had worked for only four years could not go to an industrial tribunal, but could have dispute with the employer, a dispute in which ACAS could assist if the parties agreed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct, but the key argument—which persuaded me to clarify in the new clause that individual conciliation would be excluded—is that, were ACAS to decide to charge in the area of industrial tribunals, it would in effect be charging for the administration of justice, because tribunals are a judicial process. That argument was sufficiently persuasive for us to make the situation clear in the Bill. I can only repeat to the hon. Gentleman that he cannot have his cake and eat it. He cannot argue on the one hand that it is wrong for the Government to act in any way that might be seen to challenge the impartiality or independence of ACAS—we have hot done so—and, on the other, that the Government should say what should not be subject to charges. All that we have done is create an opportunity for ACAS to charge for certain services and to make judgments about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Hutton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that new clause 9(3) contains a fundamental typographical error? The last word, "case", should surely be "cases". If the clause is to mean what he says it is to mean, it will have to be amended.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is an error, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for describing it as typographical. I am not certain that the hon. Gentleman is correct in his anslysis of the new clause, but I have now given it thought. The answer to his question that the singular includes the plural.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Joyce Quin <span class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following: New clause 5—Rights in respect of adoption—
<br><blockquote><p>"(). (6) Regulations may provide for the provisions of the 1978 Act and Schedule 2 to this Act, to have effect as if for the words 'given birth' were substituted 'accepted the placement of a child for adoption' and the regulations may include such incidental or supplemental provisions as appear to the Secretary of State necessary or desirable".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Both new clauses deal with a similar subject and they would establish an important principle in our legal system. For the first time, they would give statutory rights to adoptive parents, who now have none, to leave or benefits analogous to the maternity benefits available to natural mothers. We discussed that matter at length when we dealt with clause 20.<br><br>
New clause 1 was tabled by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham), who is concerned with the rights of adoptive parents. It is a pleasure to move a new clause that was tabled by a Conservative Member, because I hope that there will be considerable cross-party agreement on the issue. However, I am slightly worried because no Conservative Member leapt to his feet to volunteer to move his hon. Friend's new clause, but I trust that it will be supported by some Conservative Members of the Committee as well as the Minister. I am aware that he has written in a rather negative way to some of my colleagues about the matter and, given that some of his hon. Friends clearly feel strongly about it, I hope that he will at least consider giving adoptive parents a statutory right.<br><br>
I refer to some information that has been supplied by the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering. In 1988, which I assume is the last year for which the organisation has figures, there were 7,390 adoptions in the United Kingdom compared with 760,000 births. That shows that it would be possible to extend some of the rights that are available to natural parents to adoptive parents. I hope that the Minister will not say that, as the number is small, there is no problem. We want him to understand that what adoptive parents must go through to establish a good relationship with their adoptive child is similar to what happens to natural parents are at the birth of their child. After the adoptive child has arrived in the adoptive home is a good moment for there to be some statutory leave entitlement.<br><br>
The British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering have drawn attention to why adopters need special leave. They state:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 746</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"The demands made on a family by the arrival of a new child are very similar for both birth parents and adoptive parents, indeed for adopters they can often be even greater as children may arrive at short notice with complex histories that affect the care they need."</p></blockquote>
The Committee might consider that cases involving older children could not be compared with those of new-born babies. However, the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering go on:
<br><blockquote><p>"Older children may have had a difficult family background prior to the placement and may have behavioural problems, such children require stability and a great deal of attention particulary in the early stages. Naturally, adopted children, whatever their age also need to spend time with their new parent, especially in the important and special early weeks and an adoptive mother will want to stay with her child at this time, just like a birth mother. Adoptive parents have to make the same mental and emotional adjustment as any other new parents to their new role and responsibilities and may experience the same sleepless nights and 'settling in' problems."</p></blockquote>
Those of us who know people who have adopted children will be aware of the great commitment that they must make in terms of time and effort. In many cases, that can be compared directly with the position of a family after a child is born.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Oliver Heald <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The present law on maternity is based to a considerable extent on the burdens that a woman has during pregnancy and immediately after childbirth, which are of a physical nature and concern the nursing of the child. Does the hon. Lady agree that, if a regime were set up for adoptive parents—which I support—a slightly different system should be established from that for natural parents? What sort of regime does she have in mind?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made a fair point and he will note that we have used the permissive term "may by order" in the new clause. By that we want some flexibility built into the system so that the Government can consider the proposals and possibly discuss with the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering what would be the best approach. The hon. Gentleman is right: the two situations are not directly comparable, especially when we consider the maternity leave entitlement before the birth of a child. That is not applicable in the case of adoptive parents, partly because they do not know that the child will arrive until a few days beforehand. The notification procedures would be impossible in such cases. Furthermore, it is clear that the period immediately after the child has arrived in the home is most important to the adoptive parents. We would ask the Government to look at this part of maternity leave.<br><br>
The new clause makes that possible, but the Minister may reply that, even with the permissive term "may by order extend the rights conferred on employees" to adoptive parents, it still does not give him the flexibility that is necessary in order to produce something suitable.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
Personally, I would be happy with that as long as there was a commitment by the Government to give statutory entitlements to adoptive parents in that situation. The new clauses contain the flexibility the Committee will feel appropriate in the circumstances.<br><br>
The British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, besides dealing with special leave for adoptive parents, also looked at other countries. Although the Government
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0763">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 747</span>
do not like comparisons with other countries and feel that they should not set a precedent for how the Government should operate in the United Kingdom, none the less comparisons with other European countries are useful in this respect.<br><br>
The British Agencies point out that
<br><blockquote><p>"adoptive parents in other European countries are entitled to special leave from their employment in order to take a child into their home. Such leave is available in Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, Greece, Portugal and Spain for periods of between 10 weeks to two years, with three countries offering some form of financial benefits and others giving leave on an unpaid basis".</p></blockquote>
It is clear that in those countries where there are statutory entitlements those entitlements are not identical with those available for natural parents. None the less, the entitlements are appropriate in the circumstances.<br><br>
The British agencies also deal with how an employer would benefit from giving statutory leave to adoptive parents. That is important, because it is possible for Government Members to speak in terms of such measures being a burden on business. We would argue that there are advantages to an employer.<br><br>
We agree with the British agencies that employers can achieve savings on recruitment and retraining costs if they give leave of this kind. Indeed, briefings from the British agencies point out that
<br><blockquote><p>"adoptive parents could well be amongst the company's most experienced and mature employees."</p></blockquote>
That is a valid observation.<br><br>
Adoptive parents have to go through a lengthy procedure to decide whether they are suitable to adopt children. As a result, they tend to be people who make a contribution to the community, who are experienced and valuable in their place of work. The agencies' briefing points to the possibilities of having fringe advantages. Company image would be enhanced by pursuing such an approach, a company would be seen as an employer likely to "promote and maintain staff loyalty".<br><br>
An interesting article appeared in the Maternity Alliances' publication, "Maternity Action" by Dr. Elizabeth J. White, entitled "A Fair Deal for Adoptive Parents?" It points out that some companies have an enlightened approach in this respect. The Minister may say that some of our most important companies promote good practice. I would agree. I would not want anything that I say about a statutory entitlement to hinder the process of encouraging companies to adopt best practice. However, there are also many instances when adoptive parents are not treated sympathetically by employers. There should therefore be a statutory entitlement.<br><br>
I know from my colleagues that the Minister has received letters on the subject. Hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber have cited examples of adoptive parents being given no leave by their companies, or being told simply to take their annual holiday entitlement, and being treated extremely unsympathetically. That is a tragedy, as adoptive parents are undertaking a great service to society. The article by Dr. Elizabeth White shows that some companies have a good record, but that some of the companies surveyed gave no leave and no benefits in pay to the adoptive parent and pursued a harsh approach.<br><br>
The Government have responded to various hon. Members on the matter. In a letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), the Minister said:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 748</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Given that the overall number of problems that arise on employment rights for adoptive parents is comparatively small, we have concluded that it would not be sensible to try to extend the legislation, in this already highly complicated legal area, in order to cover adoptive mothers."</p></blockquote>
The Minister used an interesting phrase. When we discussed the amendments to clause 20, the Minister told us that the set-up was not complicated and that our amendments, which would have simplified the system, were not acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span> <i>indicated dissent.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Minister dissents. He will have an opportunity to set the record straight.<br><br>
I contest the Minister's statement that, because
<br><blockquote><p>"the overall number of problems that arise on employment rights for adoptive parents is comparatively small",</p></blockquote>
the Government should do nothing about the problem. It could be argued that if the number is comparatively small, it would be easy for the Government to resolve the problem. That should be no excuse for the hardship and sometimes trauma that adoptive parents suffer because of the attitude of some employers. The article by Dr. Elizabeth White gives many reasons, in addition to those that I have already quoted, why there is a strong case for giving such rights to adoptive parents.<br><br>
Adoptive parents have paid national insurance contributions just like natural parents and justifiably feel that they have a right to a state entitlement. Moreover, the adoptive parent saves the state a tremendous amount of money by adopting a child. If children were not adopted, they would end up in care, often for most of their young lives, which would be expensive for the state. By making a suitable provision in the Bill, the Government would help to save themselves a great deal of money. I do not know whether the Government have any information that they could give the Committee to show how the financial calculations might work out; in any case, the point is worth bearing in mind.<br><br>
The Minister often complains that I always ask him whom he has consulted. I do not apologise for that. A Government, especially if they are not elected with an absolute majority of the votes cast, have a duty not to act as though they had an overwhelming majority and a duty to consult all interested groups and members of the public to try to ensure that their policies are broadly acceptable.<br><br>
I would maintain—although not at length because I should be ruled out of order—that there are many instances of the Government simply ignoring public opinion and informed groups. However, I shall not ask the Minister whom he has consulted, because I suspect the answer would be that he has not consulted anyone since the Government have previously ruled out such proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fairness, the hon. Lady should acknowledge that most of the issues about which she has asked me whether consultations have been held have been on Government clauses. This is not a Government clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. However, the new clauses, and in particular the new clause tabled by the Minister's hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East, have been on the amendment paper for some time. If the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0764">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 749</span>
had been keen to introduce such a right, he might have consulted about it, but he has perhaps concluded that that was not necessary because he has already accepted the argument. One can always hope that. However, even if the Minister agrees that such action is appropriate, I would none the less make a plea to him that he consult some of the groups that have supported the proposals. Those groups include the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, which I have already mentioned, the Maternity Alliance and other organisations concerned with the rights of adoptive parents.<br><br>
I believe that adoptive parents do the state, as well as their adoptive children, a great service. That should be recognised in law. The rights of the child should also be considered and I hope that that will be a factor in causing the Government to change their minds on the issue. If adoption is undertaken in helpful circumstances—and Opposition Members believe that by giving such statutory entitlement, the process of adoption would be helped—it can give great joy, both to families where there are already children and to childless couples.<br><br>
Opposition Members and the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East have raised an important principle. Even if the Government feel that they cannot accept the wording of the new clauses in its entirety, despite the efforts of Opposition Members to make those clauses flexible, I none the less hope that the Minister will respond positively to the principle behind them and give some hope that the valuable work of adoptive parents will be recognised by the state.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Cheryl Gillan <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chesham and Amersham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East for tabling a new clause on such an important issue. He is well known not only for being himself an adoptive parent but also for the great interest he takes in the subject. He spotted an area that was missing from the Bill and brought it to the attention of both Government and Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I heartily join with the hon. Lady in paying tribute to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East, but I should point out that the Opposition tabled an amendment to clause 20 that included the rights of adoptive parents, which forms the basis of the new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for that clarification. However, I still feel that my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East noticed that major omission from the legislation right from the beginning. The Government were guilty of a sin of omission in having missed the opportunity of examining that area, perhaps thereby denying that small section of the population the same rights conferred on others by the Bill.<br><br>
It has already been said that the number of adoptions has dropped dramatically. That trend has been more or less continuous since 1975. About 6,000 to 7,000 adoptions take place every year. Of those adoptions approximately 15 per cent. are of children less than one year old. In 1990, when the most recent statistics were published—there were 969 under-ones adopted in this country.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 750</span>
Although no current figures are available—I do not believe that statistics are compiled on this matter—I, like my hon. Friend, have had assistance from the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering, which estimate that 400 adoptions a year are made by couples where the mother is not the birth mother of the child. Those women at present are not covered by the legislation that we are considering. I believe that they need protection.<br><br>
The right to maternity leave, which was dealt with by clause 20, is conferred on those absent from work wholly or partly because of pregnancy or childbirth. The absence of such protection for the adoptive mother causes a great anomaly. An adoption order cannot be made unless a child is at least 19 weeks old and has been living, at all times during the preceding 13 weeks, with its potential adoptive parents.<br><br>
A woman might leave work after being notified that a suitable baby had come up for adoption. That child would be placed with the family and, during that 13-week period, the birth mother would be allowed to take the child back. That could result in the adoptive mother having no right to return to work. In addition to her agonies of losing a long-expected baby whom she had expected to come into her family, she would find that she had lost her livelihood and career. That would be intolerable. Such women need their rights protected by legislation.<br><br>
It has been argued that such matters are best left to employers. I think that in many instances that is true. However, we must consider the record in this respect, which is not good.<br><br>
Abbey National plc allows adoptive parents—male and female employees—up to 14 weeks' leave to adopt a child. However, those employees are not entitled to maternity pay or a returner's bonus. Even the civil service's adoption regulations are not quite up to the standard of those that apply to birth mothers and fathers. It is up to the discretion of the civil service's departments whether adoptive mothers are granted paid or unpaid leave. Up to 20 days' paid leave may be granted when the child is first adopted, although the right to paid leave is not normally applicable for pre-adoptive families. Unpaid leave of up to 52 weeks, less a period of any paid leave, may also be granted. Male employees may also be eligible for adoption leave in the civil service. That is a breakthrough. However, the conditions are second class and on a second tier compared with the provisions for real parents.<br><br>
Perhaps one of the best employers is Thames Water, which allows women who adopt a child aged under five to qualify for full maternity leave. Thames Water, however, is an exception to the rule. Where there is no provision for rights for adoptive parents, the Government should introduce legislation to ensure that there is.<br><br>
Although I am speaking to the new clauses, I am unable to support either of them. I do not believe that they have examined fully or covered the complexity of this aspect of maternity leave. Adopting under-ones is completely different from adopting an older child. That complex distinction needs to be made and examined fully by the Government before legislation is introduced to afford protection.<br><br>
I hope that after the debate my right hon. Friends will examine the situation for adoptive parents, especially when a very young child is involved, and eventually extend the valuable protections afforded to birth mothers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0765">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 751</span>
to the small section of society that does much, not only for the children to whom such people provide a home, but for the state and the Government by reducing the burden on the public purse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Miller</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to join in congratulating the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East on bringing the matter to the attention of the Committee. The new clause and that tabled by my hon. Friends are worthy of serious examination because of the moral arguments that we have heard this morning. I do not intend to speak for long, because my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) made a powerful speech that was morally right, logically correct and that set out the financial arguments in a way which the Minister would find difficult to refute. I hope that he accepts my hon. Friends suggestion that he considers the implications of the new clauses before Report.<br><br>
There are enormous pressures on families who adopt. The realities facing families very often include the additional pressure of bringing up children with disabilities. Those families need to come to terms not only with a relationship with a new child, but that they have taken on a burden that can create pressures in families. Time to enable an adjustment to that is especially important and the argument for that has been well made.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs. Gillan) referred to a water company. I shall refer to another liquid company, Guinness plc, which illustrates that this is not a new idea. More than 10 years ago, Guinness Export, as it was then known, a subsidiary of Guinness plc, granted a woman in Liverpool the right to take maternity leave for the process of adoption. In the run up to the adoption, the woman was allowed a couple of days off for general counselling and when the adoption occurred she was given the same rights afforded by the company's maternity leave provisions.<br><br>
That subsidiary of a large corporation was relatively small and it could be argued because of that, the decision has a significant impact on the economics and management of the business.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East argued that the alternative to that would have meant the loss of the valuable skills of a person who had been trained for a long time and, had that happened, the company would have had to engage in additional costs. The logic to the company was clear cut even though it was a relatively small operation.<br><br>
The overall cost to the Exchequer would be small. That was explained by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham. The benefits to both the company and the family would be clear, and there are plenty of examples of that. Achieving the measures would be complicated. However, it is no good the Government saying that the provisions of the new clause are so complicated that they will not implement them because they would affect only a handful of people. That returns to the moral argument that was so powerfully put by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East. The new clause would affect only a few people at small cost, but there is a clear moral duty for the state to support those people. It is a question of fairness and equity for those who often make a significant contribution to the national insurance fund.<br><br>
Against that background, I join my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East in asking the Minister, if he
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 752</span>
is unable to accept the exact wording of the new clauses, to give the Committee a commitment that the moral, logical and financial arguments have been considered and that he will introduce a positive framework to solve the problem on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Heald</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to associate myself with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham and those of Opposition Members. There is a difference between an adoptive parent and a natural parent in terms of maternity leave provisions and the right to return to work. That some provision is necessary is clear in my respectful submission, as we used to say in the courts. There is no logical distinction between the circumstances of a natural parent and an adoptive parent in the period after the child arrives. If every other country in Europe can help with the problem, this country should be able to as well.<br><br>
It should not be underestimated that parents who adopt children provide this country with a major public service—they often adopt children with disabilities or with behavioural problems and provide real homes for children who might not otherwise have them. To deny those parents help is wrong. A distinction may have to be made between the ages of children. The new clauses may not be adequate, but I hope that action can be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that adoptive parents sometimes face severe difficulties in combining work and family responsibilities. I sympathise with the comments of my hon. Friends and by the hon. Member for Gateshead, East. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham correctly said that my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East has a long-standing interest in the subject. That was shown by the speed with which he tabled the new clause. I am not trying to say that he was the first to notice the problem or that Opposition Members were not also concerned.<br><br>
Although I sympathise, I must say that I do not think that legislation is appropriate in this case. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham suggested several problems that we might face in trying to legislate. The distinction between children aged under one year and over one year and the amount of time off that should be given to an adoptive parent presents problems: a child is aged under one year for 52 weeks and if an adoption takes place at 48 weeks, there are four weeks until the first birthday. Therefore, it is not easy to draft such legislation. Complex issues would have to be addressed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Gateshead, East raised a point about clause 20. I did not say that the issues were not complex, but I undertook to issue guidance to help companies and individuals to understand their rights. I also gave a commitment to try to link that advice and guidance to the explanation that the Secretary of State for Social Security will provide. I did not say that the issue was straight forward. I accept that the provisions for maternity leave are complex.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for those words from the Minister. I accept that translating the new clauses into law presents problems, but I urge the Minister not to use that as an excuse for not agreeing to them. I understand that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0766">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 753</span>
Government Members hope for some sort of legislative action and such legislation exists in other countries so the problems cannot be insuperable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to address that and, I hope, say something later that will reassure the hon. Lady.<br><br>
The purpose of statutory maternity provisions is to safeguard the mother's career while also giving her a period to prepare for and recover from childbirth and to nurse and care for the baby in its early life. That point was made earlier by my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, North (Mr. Heald).<br><br>
The Government have carefully considered the suggestions that have from time to time been made for the introduction of a similar right for adoptive mothers, but there are too many differences in circumstances for such a provision simply to be grafted on to the maternity legislation. My hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham said that only some 15 per cent. of adoptions in England and Wales were of children under one year of age. Many adoptions can and do occur up to the age of 18, sometimes after a period of long-term fostering. The kinds of considerations underlying the maternity provisions are clearly different and would not apply.<br><br>
In addition, new clause 1 would provide for similar rights for adoptive fathers. In the Government's view, paternity leave and parental and family leave are not appropriate matters for legislation. They are best agreed between the parties concerned on the basis of their own priorities, needs and circumstances. Statutory requirements in this area would increase employers' costs and damage job opportunities. We shall discuss paternity leave in relation to another new clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to be drawing a distinction between maternity leave provisions, which can be legislated for legitimately because women need to recover physically from childbirth, and family leave or paternity leave, which relates to the new circumstances of new parents, adoptive or natural. The distinction seems arbitrary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to explain that new clause 1 would apply also to fathers. I was trying to explain the difference between the two. There should be no confusion.<br><br>
Birth mothers who wish to return to work have a clear time scale on which to operate. In contrast, the time scale for adoption can be very uncertain. Sometimes the child is placed with the adoptive parents at very short notice, and the timing of any court hearings may also be uncertain. The unpredictability of adoptive leave would create significant problems for employers and be an unacceptable burden on them.<br><br>
I accept what was said by the hon. Member for Ellesmere and Port Neston (Mr. Miller) and my hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham about good practice and what good employers do. That is something that ought to be encouraged. The practice of some of these companies ought to be brought to wider attention. I may want to study that much further to consider whether a way in which that could be done would be to bring that to wider attention and, whether better practice could be fostered in that respect. I shall certainly undertake to give that matter careful consideration and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 754</span>
see whether that can be made more widely available through Department publications and perhaps foster a spread of good practice and see how other companies have implemented that. There are signs that previous Department publications about job sharing and splitting jobs, which have brought good practices to more wide-spread attention, have been profitable. That might be a way to make progress on this matter.<br><br>
I shall carefully reflect on what members of the Committee have said this morning but, at present, I cannot see how these proposals will be acceptable to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am disappointed with the Minister's reply. I do not think that he meets the anxieties of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. It is disappointing that we have not even had a commitment from the Minister to examine the possibility of introducing legislation about this matter.<br><br>
The Minister's only commitment was to try to give more publicity to best practice. Although useful as a complement to other approaches, that approach on its own would mean that it would take hundreds of years for all firms to follow the good practice that was recommended. In our debates in the Committee we have heard of many examples where good practice clearly was not followed by firms. To rely simply on that proposal as a means of helping adoptive parents is unsatisfactory.<br><br>
I am disappointed that Minister did not even say that he would consider legislation that would enable adoptive parents to have some time off after the adopted child had arrived in the home. Perhaps just the adoptive mother could have the right to return. My hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston has pointed out that there is nothing new about this issue. A considerable number of employees have been treated unsatisfactorily in this respect for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right to return is even more important when the potential adoptive parent has the adoption fail because the birth mother takes the child back. I think that it is important that in such instances the individual is provided with the right of a return to work. That individual would invariably be the potential adoptive mother whose adoption attempt had failed. I hope that the hon. Lady will regard that as one of the most pressing aspects of this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to do so. The Minister completely underestimated the emotional difficulties that adoptive parents may experience, either because of such circumstances as the hon. Lady has outlined or because of the adjustment process, which takes time. We all want adoptions to be as successful as possible. We must support adoptive parents in the important work that undertaking an adoption involves.<br><br>
I hoped that I would be able to seek to withdraw the new clauses in the light of the Minister's assurances but, because the Minister has said that he envisages no legislation whatsoever, I have no alternative but to press the new clause to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br><br>
We tabled two new clauses to deal with the employment practices in the House of Commons and new clause 3 made it onto the amendment paper.<br><br>
We want employment practices in the house to be brought into line with employment practices in establishments in the rest of the country. It is in keeping with the Government's policy of removing Crown immunity and other special restrictions placed on Government establishments.<br><br>
The new clause is aimed at dealing with the rights available to the staff of the House of Commons. By making the part of subsection (2) specified in the amendment ineffective, those people would be given the rights that are available to others in chapter II of part IV of the 1992 Act. Those rights include the duty of the employer to consult trade union representatives, the complaint by a trade union and a protective award, entitlement under a protective award, the termination of employment during a protected period, a complaint by an employee to an industrial tribunal, the duty of an employer to notify the Secretary of State of certain redundancies and the offence of failure to notify. They would improve the rights of the staff.<br><br>
We believe that it is time to bring the practices in the House into line with those of all other establishments. There is no justifiable argument, especially nowadays, for setting aside the House of Commons staff from the rest of the workers and employees.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope it will be helpful to the Committee if I explain briefly what the effect of the new clause would be.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 756</span>
Subsection 278(1) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 provides that the Act applies, with certain specified exceptions, to employment as,
<br><blockquote><p>"A relevant member of the House of Commons staff"</p></blockquote>
in the same way that it applies to other employment. The phrase,
<br><blockquote><p>"relevant member of the House of Commons staff"</p></blockquote>
is defined, in section 139 of the 1978 Act, as meaning
<br><blockquote><p>"(A) any person appointed by the House of Commons Commission … or employed in the refreshment department; and (B) any member of Mr. Speaker's personal staff."</p></blockquote>
However, section 278(2) of the 1992 Act provides that the statutory redundancy handling procedures contained in chapter II of part IV of the Act—that is, the duty of an employer to consult trade union representatives and to notify the Secretary of State about proposed redundancies—are excepted from section 278(1). That means, therefore, that those procedures do not apply in relation to relevant members of the House of Commons staff, although there is, of course, nothing to prevent appropriate consultation from taking place should such circumstances arise.<br><br>
The effect of the amendment would be to remove the exception contained in section 278(2). That would mean that the statutory redundancy handling procedures did, after all, apply in relation to relevant members of the House of Commons staff.<br><br>
Members of the Committee are aware from our consideration of clause 27 that the statutory redundancy handling procedures contained in the 1992 Act implement the European Community collective redundancies directive of 1975. Article 2 of the directive specifically states that the directive shall not apply to workers employed by public administration bodies or by establishments governed by public law. It is clear, therefore, that the directive, which was revised by the Council of Ministers as recently as last summer, does not require the staff of the House to be covered.<br><br>
Nevertheless, as the hon. Member never tires of telling me, that does not preclude the Government from going further than the directive if they consider it appropriate to do so. I am prepared to consider further whether extending the statutory rights to consultation would be appropriate in this case.<br><br>
However, it would be only courteous and right that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee should agree that it would be helpful first for the Government to seek the views of Madam Speaker on the subject and that no commitment should be made until that has been done. I hope that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will agree to withdraw the new clause and I undertake to pursue the principles behind it in the way that I have suggested.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Opposition would be able to curry favour with the staff of the House, but it looks as though the Minister has upstaged me because he will also curry favour with them. I am pleased with what the Minister has said. He is correct. It is appropriate to hold discussions before the clause is introduced. For that reason, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</span></p>

New Clause 6</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p>"Section 64(1)(a) of the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 shall be amended as follows '(1) Section 54 does not apply to the dismissal of an employee from any employment if the employee (a) was not continuously employed for a period of not less than six months ending with the effective date of the termination.".—[<i>Ms. Quin.</i>]</p>
<p><i>Brought up, and read the First time</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take new clause 15—<i>The rights of part-time workers in unfair dismissal cases</i>—
<br><blockquote><p>"(). The period of continuous employment which a part-time employee must have served before he has a right to pursue a case of unfair dismissal shall be reduced from five years to two.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New clauses 6 and IS deal with the right to protection against unfair dismissal. They refer to the qualifying periods which an employee must work before he or she has any right to protection against unfair dismissal. We have referred obliquely to the issue many times during the debates. The new clauses allow us to deal with it in its own right.<br><br>
New clause 6 deals with full-time employees. In effect, it reduces the qualifying period from two years to six months. New clause 15 deals with part-time workers and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 758</span>
reduces their qualifying period from five years to two years.<br><br>
Ideally, the Opposition would be happy if the qualifying period was the same for part-time and full-time workers. Evidence shows that, on the whole, other European countries have a much shorter qualifying period than Britain for both part-time and full-time workers. Most other European countries do not discriminate between the hours worked. The Government may throw up their hands in horror at the new clauses. I am sure that they would have been even more horrified had we proposed that there be no qualifying period for either full-time or part-time workers.<br><br>
The proposals for full-time workers restore the rights as set out in the 1978 Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spencer Batiste <span class='memberconstituency'>(Elmet)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady recall that when the qualifying period was six months, employers took a hard view of employees' suitability in the first year, especially if lengthy training was involved? Workers were often dismissed before the six months were over because employers did not want them to acquire protection. Without that qualifying period, employers would have been happy to employ the workers for longer to discover whether they could make the grade.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under the two-year qualifying period, there is much disturbing evidence—provided largely by the citizens advice bureaux—that employers dismiss workers just before the end of the two-year period. The hon. Gentleman's comments are valid for any qualifying period. I assure him that there is enormous evidence that employers are misusing the current qualifying period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Batiste</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know of the evidence to which the hon. Lady refers, but that is a different issue. If her figures are right, employers are saying that they will take workers out before they acquire protection in any event, whether or not they are satisfactory employees. The qualifying period was extended to two years because it was decided that six months was not long enough for many employers to be able to make a realistic assessment of the performance and capabilities of workers. Two years were considered to be a reasonable training and assessment period, as the employee would not fear being thrown out if he did not make the grade early on.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Prior to attending the Committee this morning, I examined some of the debates that have taken place in the House on this subject over several years, including the debate that took place in 1978 not long after the 1978 Act came into force. The weight of opinion is not in accordance with the views expressed by the hon. Gentleman. On that occasion, Conservative Members wanted to increase the qualifying time. In that respect they have been consistent, just as we, the Opposition, have been consistent in our belief that the qualifying period favoured by Conservative Members is far too long.<br><br>
In that debate in 1978, the evidence of employers that was referred to was certainly not as one-sided as the hon. Gentleman seems to suggest. There was no great movement by employers to change the qualifying period from six months to a year which, at that time, was what the Conservatives wanted. Subsequently, during the 1980s, the Conservatives extended the qualifying period
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0769">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 759</span>
to two years. I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman can generalise about all employers finding the six-month period difficult, for the reasons that he gave. Many employers are able to assess an employee's capability within that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Batiste</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I came across many formal procedures in companies, where employees were assessed at five months with the clear proviso that if, by that time, they did not make the grade, they would be dismissed and that the risk of keeping them in employment would not be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman talks about making assessments after five months. Nothing that he has said convinces me that one year or two years is more appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. friend agree that, even if the qualifying period were implemented as she suggests, there would be nothing to preclude an employer from dismissing an employee on the grounds of suitability, provided that the employer had good grounds for doing so? The protection that the proposals would provide would be against employers who dismiss employees without having good grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend is right. The new clauses deal with unfair dismissal. Obviously, it is always possible for an employer to show that he had good reason for wanting to dismiss an employee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Batiste</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, having to go through the procedures and having to defend oneself at a tribunal is different from making a decision that an employee is not going to make the grade without any risk of going to the tribunal. My experience was that the people who were most disadvantaged by the unwillingness of employers to give a long trial period were those who were the most disadvantaged in society, such as prisoners who were being rehabilitated and disabled people. Those disadvantaged people lost most by that shortest period of assessment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should be more persuaded by the hon. Gentleman, were not it for the weight of evidence that shows how the two-year limit is misused by employers. That makes me feel that any limit can be misused by unscrupulous employers. It is much harder on employees who have worked for an employer for almost two years suddenly to discover three days before that two-year period is up that they can be dismissed with no protection against unfair dismissal. That injustice in our society needs to be put right. Given the hon. Gentleman's comments, I shall quote from the briefing sent to us by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux:
<br><blockquote><p>"CAB evidence indicates that many employers are aware that employees are protected from unfair dismissal once they have two years continuous full time service and some are acting with increasing cynicism and exploiting employees' lack of employment protection. The crudest form of this growing cynicism is the practice of dismissing employees just before they qualify for protection against unfair dismissal."</p></blockquote>
12.30 pm<br><br>
I shall cite some examples from the briefing, as it is important that the Committee has the information. In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 760</span>
Wiltshire, a citizens advice bureau client who worked at a restaurant was dismissed by letter three days short of completing two years service; in Avon, a client who was employed as a creche controller was dismissed with one week's notice, which left him one day short of two years service; in north London, a client was dismissed one week before she had completed two years employment. The reason for that, which should interest the hon. Member for Elmet, was that she was "not reaching standard targets", although she had passed her probationary period and had worked at a consistent standard since.<br><br>
In Greater Manchester, a client was given one week's notice of dismissal, which terminated her employment one day short of reaching two years service. She felt that that was a calculated step on her employer's part—she worked for a solicitors firm.<br><br>
Those examples demonstrate that employers are well aware of the two-year qualifying period and are capable of misusing it to the great detriment of their employees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Batiste</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head but he must bear in mind that if somebody is dismissed in that way, the benefits to which he or she is subsequently entitled are affected, and the chance of re-employment can be wrecked. In the current labour market, that is a real problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Batiste</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The examples cited by the hon. Lady do not support her contention. They prove that, in many cases, in the period immediately before statutory rights are acquired, the employer makes an assessment of whether to keep the employee. The hon. Lady has not seriously addressed the issue that I raised: if that period is too short, there will not be a proper assessment period for many workers who require skills or training during a probationary period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman thinks that two years is too long to make such an assessment and that for someone not to have protection against unfair dismissal, having worked for an employer for one year, 11 months and approximately 20 days, is absolutely ridiculous? It would be heartening if the hon. Gentleman would express concern about the cases quoted by the citizens advice bureaux and about the fact that an employee's career and life may be blighted by misuse of the long qualifying period.<br><br>
We are dealing with unfair dismissal. In one of the cases that I quoted, the employee had been assessed as suitable for the job and had passed the probationary period but was dismissed with no recourse against the decision a few days short of the two-year period. I do not know how the hon. Member for Elmet can defend that.<br><br>
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux stresses that such dismissals are often motivated by the desire to prevent an employee from gaining employment rights. Sometimes, employees are dismissed and then re-employed so that they have to wait another two years before gaining employment rights.<br><br>
A citizens advice bureau in Gloucestershire reported that a client who worked in a senior post for a local company had stated that it was standard practice to dismiss shop floor employees just before they reached two
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0770">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 761</span>
years continuous service and to re-employ them two days later. A citizens advice bureau in Merseyside reported that a client who was one week short of completing two years service working for a security firm—the sector which the Minister felt did not have many problems with low pay or employment conditions—was dismissed for being off sick. His employer subsequently contacted him and asked him to come and work for the firm again.<br><br>
A CAB in Essex reported a client who had been employed for 23 months when he was made redundant. Had the dismissal been one month later he would have qualified for redundancy pay. After five months' unemployment, he was re-employed by the same employer. He has now worked for 23 months again, and is again being faced with redundancy. Those outrageous examples would be deplored by anyone who was fair-minded. I hope that whichever Minister replies will consider such cases and try to ensure that measures are taken to stop such widespread abuse.<br><br>
New clause 15 deals with part-time employees. At present, employees who work between eight and 16 hours per week must work for the same employer for five years before they have any protection against unfair dismissal. That is outrageous. Employees who work less than eight hours per week never acquire protection against unfair dismissal. These days, people may have part-time jobs on such a basis that run for many years, but they have no employment rights in relation to unfair dismissal.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us how many of the nation's part-time employees have no rights in relation to unfair dismissal? I understand it to be the majority because the majority have not worked with their present employers for more than five years. I was given some information on the matter in a Written Answer from the Department of Employment. I calculate that in my region, the majority of part-time workers and 25 per cent. of full-time workers—having worked for their present employer for less than two years—do not have protection against unfair dismissal. Overall, that makes 30 per cent. of the northern region's work force. All other regions have similar percentages.<br><br>
It is disgraceful that the majority of part-time workers have no such protection and that many full-time employees who have worked for their employer for a considerable time—but not quite two years—are also without rights.<br><br>
An article in <i>Bargaining Report</i> dated December 1991 considers dismissal rights in Europe. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the UK, as we have already shown, workers need to have worked at least two years to take an unfair dismissal case. In addition they need to be working more than 16 hours a week. If working less than 16 hours then they need five years' service to qualify. Those working less than eight hours a week can never claim unfair dismissal in the tribunals.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>No other EC state imposes a two year qualification on employees to enable them to exercise their statutory rights in this area. Nor do any states, in their unfair dismissal law, discriminate between workers dependent on the hours that they work."</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that a minority of countries exclude employees with a very short service from statutory notice rights, but none applies the criteria that exist in the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I know that the Government do not like those European comparisons but, given that the past qualifying period for full-time workers was six months, we seem to have been
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 762</span>
steadily going in the wrong direction in dealing with unfair dismissal in the past 14 years. The 1978 Act was amended by Conservative Governments, first, to increase the period to one year and, secondly, to two years. That suggests that either the Government considered that they could not jump to two years in one go or that there were debates in their ranks about the appropriate length of time. Even if all Conservative Members seemed to share the view of the hon. Member for Elmet that six months was too short, there was no overall agreement on what the length of service should be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Batiste</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady will know that the reason why the period was extended from one year to two years was that it was considered right on the weight of evidence at the time that the qualifying periods for redundancy and for unfair dismissal should be similar. That was to ensure that a series of cases would not be brought to industrial tribunals which sought to twist unfair dismissal cases out of redundancy cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, perhaps, does not sympathise with the principle in European Community legislation that harmonisation should lead towards an improvement rather than a deterioration in employment rights.<br><br>
I believe that I have fully covered the subject. The Minister is not in his place and I had hoped to give him a chance to reply. However, some of my hon. Friends have important comments.<br><br>
We believe that the qualifying period for both full-time and part-time employees is far too long, that there are examples of widespread abuse and that the Government should act to stop it as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Eagle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time but I wish to make a few observations about the effect of the discrimination in employment rights between full-time and part-time workers. I also intend to spend a little time considering the effect of the current shape of so-called protection.<br><br>
Those who are protected against unfair dismissal can claim their statutory rights. The Government are attempting through the Bill to improve the limited rights which remain on the statute book. However, the reality is that those who attempt to claim their statutory rights, but who work in places where they are not protected against unfair dismissal, cannot do so because they risk instant dismissal. People are frightened because there is a danger that they will be arbitrarily dismissed for daring to claim those rights that even the Government believe they should have.<br><br>
For example, even people who work fewer than eight hours and have almost no rights under current law have the right to claim against sexual or racial discrimination, for equal pay, ante-natal time off, protection against dismissal for trade union activities and various other minor rights. But if they have no protection against unfair dismissal, they have no practical way of claiming their legal rights. That is a very good reason for extending the right to protection from unfair dismissal as widely and quickly as possible. If the Government are serious about extending any right at all to people in the workplace, they must consider this argument.<br><br>
My hon. Friend has already pointed out the discrimination between full-time and part-time workers
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0771">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 763</span>
and the differences in lengths of qualifying time. How fair is it for someone who has worked part-time for nearly five years to be dismissed when he or she may have worked more hours than someone who has worked full-time, for less time? It seems to be arbitrary.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
In responding to an earlier debate on adoptive parents and their potential rights of return to work, the Minister admitted that the time limit was a problem. He argued against using time limits, saying that the Government were not willing to support the clause. The same argument applies here. Time limits bring problems, as do hours limits. If somebody works for 15 hours a week, he or she does not acquire the rights acquired in time by those who work one hour a week extra. I cannot explain to a part-time worker suffering injustice that he or she does not qualify for statutory rights given to those in full-time employment.<br><br>
How can one explain to someone who has been dismissed that he or she has no right to claim protection against unfair dismissal because the hours worked have not been long enough. A person is unfairly dismissed or not. I cannot see how there can be justification on length of service or time worked per week which takes away the basic right to just treatment in the workplace.<br><br>
The clauses begin to deal with this problem by bringing qualifying times down. They also narrow the difference in rights of full-time and part-time workers.<br><br>
As the economy changes in its structure, we have seen a massive increase in the numbers of part-time workers compared with full-time workers over the past few years. A quarter of the employed workforce is now employed part-time. As the growth of part-time work continues, we see more and more people stripped of any effective rights. We cannot compete effectiveley with other advanced economies by casualising our labour force and systematically stripping people of the right to justice at work.<br><br>
Half of all women and about one in 10 men employed work part-time. The acquiring of rights at work between full-time and part-time workers discriminates against women. The Equal Opportunities Commission recently took a case to one European Parliament on this matter and lost. All the laws, as enacted, discriminate against women. What better solution than to equalise the acquired statutory rights for which people in our workforce qualify, so that there is no discrimination between part-time and full-time workers and between those who have worked longer and shorter lengths of time?<br><br>
It is logical that this should be done and it could help to create a much more genuine sense of justice and equality at work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members might be initiating a debate. They cannot expect me to agree to their new clause 6. It would impose an unjustifiable increase on the burdens of employers and reverse the changes that the Government have made to the qualifying period since 1979. We made those changes to remedy the stultifying effects on business and employment growth of the previous Administration's passion for regulation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 764</span>
The two-year period strikes a sensible balance during which the employer may assess the suitability of an employee before the employee gains this significant right to complain of unfair dismissal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thomas Graham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Renfrew, West and Inverclyde)</span></span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I make a little progress? I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman can help me out with the statement that I have just made, as that is a matter of fact. I shall give way in a few moments when he might be able to assist.<br><br>
Nor is new clause 15 any more acceptable than new clause 60. Many part-timers—all those working at least 16 hours a week—already only need two years' continuous service with their employer to qualify for the right to claim unfair dismissal in all cases. The five-year qualifying period for those who work only about one or two days a week has been in place since the Labour Government introduced it in 1975.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister has given way. We should not be setting minimum standards, but wanting to gain from experience. The Government have shown today that they are not willing to further the rights of part-time workers. They consistently reject proposals that would help part-time workers and continue to treat them as button beggars. They want such people simply to work for buttons.<br><br>
I am surprised, however, that the Minister does not recognise the contribution that has been made to the country by part-time employees. The country would grind to a halt without them. It would not be able to function. The Government do not accept that; nor do they acknowledge that part-time workers are entitled to protection. Notwithstanding the word "employee", it clearly seems that the Government want to leave the matter in the hands of the employer. They have a duty to approach part-time employment in a more progressive fashion and the new clause is a sensible place to begin.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree partly with what the hon. Gentleman said. However, if any people are guilty of talking down part-time employment, it is not Conservative but Opposition Members. The Government recognise the importance of part-time workers and the benefits that are derived from them, which enable more flexible movement in the job market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Burden</span><i>rose</i>—</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to upset people, but I seem to have done so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. When the Labour Government were in power, at least we made progress and advanced the rights of workers. Under this Government, the position has degenerated. They have introduced some of the harshest trade union legislation by any western standards. Minister, we have seen no improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman has done well recently. He must not go back to his old habits.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 765</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Knox. That is because my hearing is faulty: my hearing aid is not turned on.<br><br>
Many of us have learnt much from history lessons. The Minister rightly referred to the history of the Labour Government. Surely, we are all in the business of learning from one another, and what happened in the past is something on which we should hope to improve. The hon. Gentleman has not listened to may genuine heart-felt plea. It is time for him to consider the rights of part-time employees, who make this country what it is. They smooth the paths of industry. They should not be treated like button beggars but as people who, as Cilia Black says, "put the great into Britain".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I am intervening on the hon. Gentleman's speech, but I note his remarks about history lessons. That is the only way in which these days we can find out what happened under Labour Governments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Iain Mills <span class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ancient history.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree. As I said, the five-year qualifying period for those who work only one or two days a week has been in place since 1975. It may be necessary to go back to ancient history. The hon. Gentleman's predecessors who had the responsibility of office—unlike the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues, who have never had the responsibility of taking legislation through Parliament—understood that the length of the qualifying period must be as it currently is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will, I hope, accept that on the two-year limit for full-time employees, there has always been a clear difference of view between the Government and Opposition. If he reads the debates in 1978 and 1979 and the defence of full-time workers mounted by the then Secretary of State for Employment, the then Member for Barrow-in-Furness, Mr. Booth, he will see that there was a great difference and that Conservative Members constantly argued for fewer rights for employees.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McLouglin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to discuss Mr. Albert Booth's record. [<i>Interruption.</i>] He was not excellent at fighting elections—he lost many of them.<br><br>
I do not disagree with the hon. Lady about the two-year period, but I was referring to the five-year period which has been in operation since 1975.<br><br>
If we were to do as the Opposition propose, the effects would be largely counterproductive. Employers would reduce the number of job opportunities that they were prepared to make available to part-time workers—the very people whom the new clause is supposedly designed to protect.<br><br>
The Opposition are pushing their luck with their new clauses. We have already agreed to relax the qualifying period in some circumstances—for example, if an employer took the indefensible step of dismissing a person simply because he or she had asked for a written statement which the employer is duty bound to give. We have given an undertaking to consider extending similar protection

for the exercise of other statutory employment rights. That would be an important relaxation of the qualifying conditions that have applied since 1975.<br><br>
I cannot recommend to the Committee that we should go further than the many changes that we have made to the Bill as a result of the occasional persuasive arguments advanced by the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms. Quin</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Once again, I am disappointed by the Minister's reply. He overlooks all the evidence that we quoted about the hardship suffered by employees because of the two-year limit. I urge him to consider the weight of evidence from citizens advice bureaux and others, which shows that many employers misuse the provisions and treat their employees badly. We cited examples of people who are dismissed just before the end of the two-year period. Often, the employer wants to re-employ them afterwards, which shows that he was not dissatisfied with the employees' work but simply wanted to prevent them from acquiring employment rights. That is a dreadful state of affairs, about which the Minister should have expressed concern. I am sorry that he did not.<br><br>
I am not sure whether the Minister was a good student of history when he was at school, as he gave us a peculiar version of history and an odd account of what previous Labour Governments had done. May I remind him that at the time when, he claimed, the Labour Government were burdening businesses with massive regulations, unemployment was at a much lower level than it is now or than it has been for most of his Government's period of office.<br><br>
I do not want you to rule me out of order, Mr. Knox, for going on to a different subject, so I shall merely say that we reject the Minister's comments. He has not taken into account the seriousness of the situation and the way in which employees are exploited. For that reason I shall press the new clause to a Division.</span></p>
