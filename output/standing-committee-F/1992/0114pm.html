	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Joyce Quin 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Gateshead, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 112, in page 39, line 20, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or former pregnancy or pregnancy related sickness".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is designed to learn from the Government whether dismissal because of pregnancy also includes cases in which a person is dismissed because of pregnancy-related sickness or miscarriage. The Bill is unclear on that issue, which we feel needs clarification. It might mean that an employee who is protected by having served for more than two years full-time or for more than five years part-time is protected from dismissal, due to pregnancy-related sickness. Unless that is clarified in the Bill, women without the qualifying period for protection may not be protected from dismissal because of pregnancy-related sickness or miscarriage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been supplied with evidence that there is inadequate protection for women who are dismissed because of pregnancy-related sickness, although the incidence of such cases seems to be fairly widespread. We read and believe information that has been sent to us—we have no reason to disbelieve it—by many of the caring services, advice agencies and citizens advice bureaux.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On several occasions we have quoted cases from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux reports "Not in Labour", which deals specifically with pregnancy and employment problems, and "Hard Labour", which deals more generally with the lack of employment protection and some of the abuses of employees which, unfortunately, seem to be all too prevalent in our country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is simple. It simply adds the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or former pregnancy or pregnancy-related sickness".</p></blockquote>
I hope, therefore, that the Government will feel able to accept it. I also hope that they will be swayed by the weight of the available evidence. I do not want to go through the case studies in great detail but I shall refer to one or two of the findings of the citizens advice bureaux which relate specifically to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report "Not in Labour" found that some women are dismissed because of pregnancy-related sickness and makes the point that it is worth considering whether a fellow employee, male or female, who took time off for sickness would have been dismissed in similar circumstances. Many hon. Members, certainly my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
Friends, would claim that there is much evidence to show that other employees who were sick and not pregnant would have been treated differently. For example, an East Anglian citizen advice bureau commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are particularly concerned about women who lose their job because they are pregnant/just had a baby, for example a case of a woman who had some time off because she was suffering from sickness in early pregnancy".</p></blockquote>
A citizens advice bureau in Kent reported that a client, employed full-time as a credit controller, was made redundant while she was off sick due to pregnancy, and that a new recruit to the firm took over her job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the report, CABs have received further evidence of clients being dismissed due to pregnancy-related sickness. A CAB in Somerset reports that a client was dismissed without warning during a period of sickness connected with her pregnancy, and a CAB in Essex reports that a client, who was employed for 10 months and was 11 weeks pregnant, took one day off because of pregnancy, was threatened with dismissal and told to "either stay and do the work or leave"—a harsh reaction by the employer to someone who took only one day off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A CAB in south Wales has a client who had worked for the same firm for nearly two years and so almost came within the qualifying period. When she got pregnant she became sick and was dismissed without notice. The CAB comments that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the client has no recourse for unfair dismissal"—</p></blockquote>
as she fell foul of the two-year rule—and that a
	<br><blockquote><p>"Sex Discrimination case is not very likely."</p></blockquote>
All these examples make us hope that either the Government will accept the amendment or give an assurance that will remove our doubts. We are worried that the concerns of many seem not to be dealt with in the Bill. Advice services are concerned about that omission. The problem relates to pregnancy-related sickness and to women who are dismissed following a miscarriage. If the Government do not make a concession I hope that they will at least recognise the nature and scale of the problems and will tell us how they propose to deal with them in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment (Mr. Patrick McLoughlin)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment because it would provide an extension to the Bill's protection which would be unlimited by time and unwarranted. I firmly agree that employers should be flexible and, wherever practicable, be prepared to consider adapting their working practices to accommodate the needs of working women. However I cannot believe that Opposition Members would wish to impose such an unjustifiable burden on employers as the amendment could imply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides strong protection against dismissal for any reason connected with pregnancy, having had a baby or having taken statutory maternity leave. I do not understand how hon. Members in their reference to "former pregnancy" can possibly argue, for example that women—for women, and not men would have the enhanced protection—should be able to take any time off to look after their children, or for any other reason connected with the fact that they had children, and that there would be no requirement for them to act reasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be the effect of the amendment although I am sure that that is not what the hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0578">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) suggested. I accept her point that it is a probing amendment and not one which the Opposition expect the Government to accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would also protect all pregnancy-related sickness absence, regardless of circumstances. Anyone who is dismissed on grounds of sickness can already complain to an industrial tribunal if they qualify, and the dismissal would be unfair if the employer had acted unreasonably. However, it may be fair for an employer to dismiss someone, if the employer had acted reasonably. The employee may have taken too much time off, may not have followed the contractual notification requirements, or may simply have been unable to continue in the job. There is no good reason for giving unlimited protection to people who happen to have one type of illness, which is related to pregnancy, and not another which is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes far beyond what the European Court of Justice has said is reasonable. It held that it was for member states to decide the period of maternity leave during which women should be protected from dismissal. At the end of that time, they should be in the same position as any other employee. The amendment would be unworkable. It would constitute the greatest possible incentive for employers to avoid recruiting women, which would have serious implications. I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that the Opposition do not wish to dissuade employers from employing women, rather the opposite. I hope that our arguments have made that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he did not like the fact that the amendment was unlimited in time. Perhaps he would have considered it more favourably if it included a time limit. He also seemed to suggest that pregnancy-related sickness should be treated no differently from ordinary sickness. However, during this morning's debate, I thought that we had agreed that maternity provisions should take account of pregnancy-related sickness. So I am unclear what the Government's view is. I hope that the Minister will take advice and clarify his position, which seems to be inconsistent with what he said earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, when we discussed previous amendments to clause 21, we were pleased when the Minister accepted our point about sickness that occurs at the end of maternity leave. He said that such a situation should be covered by the provisions relating to unfair dismissal. I do not understand why the situation that we are discussing is different. I should welcome clarification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to help the hon. Lady. I am sorry if I confused her. It was certainly not my intention to do so. One of my criticisms of the amendment is the inclusion of the words, "or former pregnancy." The Bill will protect women against dismissal for being sick while pregnant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must ask the Minister to clarify what he said. Does he mean that the part of the amendment dealing with pregnancy-related sickness is unnecessary because it is already covered in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, the Minister's current response is different from his original reaction to the amendment. However, if pregnancy-related sickness is covered in the Bill, with the exception of the phrase, "or former pregnancy", and if the Minister gives me a helpful nod—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rather than giving the hon. Lady a helpful nod, may I assure her that sickness during and related to pregnancy will be protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister's comments will be noted by those organisations with special interest in the matter. I am disappointed that he has not taken account of what I said about women who may have miscarried. Perhaps he will consider that issue, because there is evidence of women being dismissed in those circumstances. I could send him that information to consider in due course. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 113, in page 39, line 26, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) after her maternity leave has ended she is dismissed and the reason for her dismissal (or, if there is more than one, the principle reason for her dismissal) is that she has given birth to a child or any other reason connected with her having given birth to a child where, before the expiry of her maternity leave, she has given her employer a certificate from a registered medical practitioner stating that by reason of disease or bodily or mental disablement she will be incapable of work at the end of her period of maternity leave,".—	<i>[Ms. Quin.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek your guidance, Mr. Knox. When we discussed this matter earlier, the Minister said that he would take account of the amendment. If he will confirm that he has, I shall not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that what I said was that I would reflect on the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am satisfied with the Minister's assurance, so I shall not press the amendment to a Division. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 127, in page 39, line 41, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(f) she has been dismissed other than in exceptional circumstances not connected with her pregnancy.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would give extra force to the Bill. Its provisions are, I think, covered in previous parts of the Bill, but this amendment incorporates what is contained in the European directive. This is a probing amendment. I should like the Minister to state clearly that he accepts the concept of the directive, which would ensure that women will not be dismissed, save in exceptional circumstances not connected with pregnancy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is unnecessary. I have already made it clear that the Bill provides extensive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
protection against dismissal. If the reason for a woman's dismissal is because she is pregnant, has recently had a baby, has exercised her right to take leave, or has to be suspended because of her condition and the type of work that she does, she is protected by the Bill's provisions. If it is because her employer thinks that mothers make bad employees, she is protected by the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Few cases will fall through that tightly drawn net.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to receive that assurance. I accept what the Minister said. I am sure that he accepts that the many organisations interested in the Bill will monitor its effects and, if there is a problem with it, or if the directive is not adhered to, will make representations. There may even be legal consequences. Given what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 115, in page 39, line 48, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) For the purposes of paragraph (a) above an employee who has been dismissed by her employer at any time while she is pregnant shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been so dismissed by reason that she is pregnant.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) For the purposes of paragraph (b) above an employee who has been dismissed by her employer after childbirth shall, unless the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been so dismissed by reason of her having given birth to a child.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is one which we strongly support. We feel that the burden of proof should be on the employer if a women has been dismissed because of pregnancy. Currently, if a woman has worked more than two years full time and five years part time, her employer has to prove that the reason for dismissal was not pregnancy or childbirth. Clause 21 provides that a woman dismissed because of pregnancy, or during her maternity leave period during which she has given birth, would be able to claim that she has been unfairly dismissed without satisfying the usual length of service and hours of work requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Women who currently meet the service and hours of work qualifying conditions to claim unfair dismissal do not have to prove that the reason for dismissal was pregnancy. It does not seem fair that the new provisions are subject to different rules. It must be made clear that the burden of proof should be on the employer to show the reason for dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is important because the experience of advisers—for example, solicitors working in law centres—is that it is often difficult to prove that an employer's real reason for dismissal of an employee was pregnancy. The employer may give other reasons—perhaps alleged misconduct, incompetence or even creeping incompetence—and it must then be proved that the employer was lying. It is possible to do so by inviting a tribunal to draw inferences from the evidence, but that requires expert preparation and representation. The point has been made to us strongly that due to the lack of legal aid and the under-resourcing of advice centres and similar organisations, such expert preparation and representation is in short supply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty of proving the real reason for dismissal means that women who currently qualify for unfair dismissal protection will enjoy more protection under the
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
Bill against unfair dismissal on the grounds of childbirth or pregnancy than women who do not currently qualify for unfair dismissal protection. The amendment would remedy that defect by placing the second group in the same position as the first group concerning the burden of proof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 21(4) requires an employer to give to the employee in writing the reasons for dismissal if she is dismissed at any time during pregnancy or during maternity leave after childbirth. Surely the employer ought to be obliged to show that the reasons given are correct and not related to pregnancy. The amendment would require that to be done. The amendment would not shift the burden of proof to the employer when a woman is dismissed after maternity leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A European Community directive was proposed several years ago to extend the burden of proof to all equal opportunity directives, but that is not the thrust of the amendment. We are not trying to reopen the debate on the burden of proof in all equal opportunities legislation, however much some of us would like to do so. The amendment relates specifically to unfair dismissal. None the less, we are aware that the United Kingdom was critical of the European Community's efforts to introduce a directive on the burden of proof. The House of Lords Select Committee on European Communities said that it was ironic that a directive that was in some respects trying to introduce United Kingdom practice to the European Community was opposed only by the United Kingdom. That may not be germane to the amendment, but it may make the Government unfairly resistant to the amendment, which sits very well with the current provisions covering women who have served the qualifying period for employment protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government do not accept the amendment, we are concerned that the United Kingdom may not fully implement the maternity rights directive, as agreed in October 1992. There is a danger that the protection given by the Bill will not be effective in practice, by comparison with normal unfair dismissal law which places the burden of proof on the employer. The Bill will create two classes of women: those who are protected by the burden of proof and those who are not. That seems to be contrary to the European directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister had any discussions with the European Commission about that issue? Will he obtain its legal advice on the point before the Bill is enacted? It would be better to clarify the issue in advance and to avoid the chance of litigation, or of the Government being arraigned for not implementing the directive correctly. If no burden of proof on the employer provision is included in the Bill for women who are not protected by the two-year and five-year rule, questions may be raised in the European Parliament about whether the Government are in breach of the European directive. The amendment is not a technical point only. It is important if women are to be able to exercise the rights that they are given by the clause. We believe that the amendment would make then-case against an employer who is bent on dismissing them unfairly far stronger. If only for that reason, I hope that the government will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Angela Eagle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wallasey)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to say a few words about the amendment. It is important, in that it will clarify the signals that the clause sends to women in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>417</span>
the workplace. The current wording of the clause may lead to misunderstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In moving the amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East said that, currently, the presumption in unfair dismissal cases—for example, for trade union activity—is that dismissal occurred for those reasons, unless the employer can prove otherwise. The clause provides a welcome extension of protection against unfair dismissal on the grounds of pregnancy, but there is no explicit statement that the employer will be presumed to have dismissed because of pregnancy,unless he or she can prove otherwise. That sends an ambiguous signal to employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only recently that the basic right that it is unfair to dismiss a woman for being pregnant has been expressed in law. However, unfair dismissal has been a reality for women for many years. The lower down the scale of part-time, more exploitative and more casual jobs one looks, the more one sees that women workers almost expect to be treated in that way. The clause is a welcome advance, in that it says explicitly that that is not an acceptable way in which to treat a woman in the workplace. But it is ambiguous. The amendment would rectify that ambiguity. The Equal Opportunities Commission agrees that such an amendment would clarify the situation and is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequences of not having an amendment to achieve clarification and to put the onus on the employer to prove that he had not dismissed a pregnant woman simply because of her condition, would result in ambiguous signals being sent and in practical difficulties being encountered in enforcing the rights of a dismissed woman. Many people underestimate how upsetting dismissal, whether wrongful or otherwise, can be. If one is dismissed unfairly, one is outraged by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that unpleasant experience is coupled with pregnancy, the sense of injustice at dismissal is increased. Under the clause, a pregnant woman has to go to an industrial tribunal and argue with her former employer in order to prove that that was why she was dismissed. It would be a foolhardy employer who openly admitted that a woman was dismissed purely because of her pregnancy. It is often difficult to prove such a case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for dismissal can be general knowledge in the workplace. However, that sort of general knowledge is difficult to prove in an industrial tribunal, under the full rigour of the law. We are asking a woman who has already been through the most upsetting experience of being dismissed simply because she is pregnant to take on her employer at an industrial tribunal, with a union official or others to advise her, and also to look for another job. It is difficult for a pregnant woman to find another job. It is even more of a disaster for a pregnant woman to be unfairly dismissed; she has to pick up the pieces of her life and at the same time needs to have the presence of mind and courage to take her case to an industrial tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The small concession contained in the amendment would strengthen the clause. If the amendment were accepted, it would send the right signal to employers: that is was unacceptable to dismiss a woman simply because

she was pregnant and that if they decided to behave in such an unacceptable way they would have to shoulder that extra burden of proof in order to evade the consequences what was considered to be unreasonable action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a logical addition to the clause. It does not establish a precedent and it sends exactly the right signal of society's view of such behaviour and of the Government's view. If an employer dismisses a woman merely for being pregnant, that employer should suffer the consequences and should not be able to get out of them by putting the onus on the woman to prove that that is why she was dismissed. The amendment is entirely consistent with the clause; it flows naturally from it and strengthens it to the right level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Olner 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Nuneaton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister will accept the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East. I repeat what I said earlier this week, when I referred to a letter from the Nuneaton citizens advice burea. It states that they knew of several pregnant women who have been dismissed for what appear to be minor problems. The bureau says that, although not proven, it seems that the reason for dismissal was indeed pregnancy. The Minister assured me then that such women would be protected by the unfair dismissal legislation. The difficulty is that many of those women work for small, unorganised companies, have no trade union presence, do not know their rights and do not know how best to proceed. They miss out on the full impact of the law at a tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When someone is dismissed in that manner, they are unable to claim unemployment benefit or sickness benefit. They are unable to claim any benefit at all. That happens at a critical and stressful time. Lest the Government forget, many of the jobs that they brag about being created are part-time jobs, mainly filled by women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the Minister's promises to my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East, it seems that the Government want to protect pregnant women from bad, unscrupulous employers who dismiss them primarily because they are pregnant. The amendment spells it out loud and clear that bad employers will not be tolerated—that they should do the same as good employers. As my hon. Friend said, the amendment would make an impact on employers' attitudes to pregnant women. I hope that fewer women are dismissed arbitrarily as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures presented by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux and various other organisations show only part of the picture. Many women are dismissed for being pregnant. They become a bind on their employers, so they are dismissed. That picture is just the tip of the iceberg. Many people in work are being denied natural justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pregnant women who are sacked cannot claim unemployment or other benefits for a long time. Even if it is proved that the dismissal was unfair, it takes months for cases to reach a tribunal; some of them never get that far. These women are without benefit for a while, but I understand that 50 per cent benefit is then paid until the case has been adjudicated upon by the tribunal. That must increase the stress on pregnant women at a time when they need to be at their best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem goes deeper if we consider the social structure of working women. There is a vast difference
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
between the rights that the more skilled, more professional women can obtain and those obtained by women who do worthwhile jobs in the less-skilled sectors, such as hotel work and catering. It is a tragic fact that women in those industries are less protected and more liable to summary dismissal. Amendment No. 115 would give those people who really need assistance the necessary clear legislation to secure their rights. Putting the burden of proof on the employer will make bad employers think twice before taking arbitrary action. The amendment is sensible and I hope that the Minister will take it on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Richard Burden 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Northfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment for Opposition Members, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East said. It is important for two reasons. First, without the amendment, there is a real danger that the Bill's provisions could be out of line with European legislation. Secondly, the amendment has a worthy purpose. If the provisions are to be effective, it must be acknowledged that the employment relationship is unequal. The ability of a woman—particularly a woman in a low-paid job in an ununionised firm—to insist on her rights is not equal to the practical ability of an employer to say no and to get away with it. That unequal relationship—which exists in other areas but is particularly important to maternity legislation—means that the law must sometimes step in not only to provide rights but to ensure that those rights can be put into effect. That is the purpose of employment protection legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is always a conscious or unconscious presumption in such employment situations. When we discussed antenatal care, an example was given of a woman who was told that she could not go to her antenatal class—I have mentioned that example twice and I make no apologies for mentioning it again. In that case, the employer can just say no. How can a woman respond to that? She cannot stop the employer from saying no, so the law needs to step in. It is even more important to be free from the threat, and sometimes the reality, of dismissal. It is not asking too much to require the employer to demonstrate that he or she had a substantial reason for dismissing that woman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not require the employer to prove that pregnancy was not connected with the dismissal, or that the principal reason for dismissal was not pregnancy. That provision is too weak. Surely, given that the employer must only demonstrate that pregnancy was not the principal reason, it is not too much to ask that the burden of proof falls on the employer. As sure as eggs are eggs, if an employer dismisses pregnant women for reasons connected with pregnancy, that will not be given as the upfront reason. It may not be the upfront reason because the employer deliberately covers it up or because the employer—either a he or she, but probably a he—says to himself and the employee that there is another reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example. I worked for a trade union before becoming a Member. I dealt with the case of a woman who suffered severe post-natal depression. She was very ill. Her employer, a large employer in the midlands, took an unsympathetic view and wished to terminate her employment. Several of us made representations to that employer, saying that he was being unreasonable and that the woman was ill, like many others of his employees. That company had a good record
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
in dealing with sickness, but for that woman it took a much harder line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember clearly that someone from the personnel department looked at me earnestly and said, "Yes, but are you sure that the woman is actually ill, or is it just post-natal depression?" The surprising thing was that that comment was made by a woman, who was responsible for implementing the company's equal opportunities policy. Even if those attitudes exist only in a minority of cases, surely it is reasonable to say that it is up to the employer to give the reason for a dismissal and to back it up with evidence; otherwise, the woman would have to prove her case. That would not be equal. Because of the problems of getting adequate representation, the costs mentioned by my right honourable Friend the Member for Gateshead, East, and the fact that the woman has to discover what is in the employer's mind, it is surely most unreasonable to put the burden of proof on the woman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would be strengthened if the burden of proof lay with the employer, not the employee—there is no middle way. That would make the law more effective. It would also give people confidence in the application of the law, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Ms. Eagle). It would show women that not only Members of Parliament but the law treats their rights seriously. It would also clearly show employers that we expect them to treat maternity rights seriously, not to dismiss women on the grounds of pregnancy, and that a serious view would be taken of any employer who tried to wrap up such a dismissal, disguising it as something else.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Hutton 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Barrow and Furness)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The background to clause 21 is a matter of historical record. The clause is the result of several cases brought before the European Court of Justice, which has clearly established that the dismissal of a pregnant woman constitutes an illegal act of discrimination under the relevant directive. My hon. Friends and I warmly welcome the fact that the Government have now attempted to enshrine that principle in British law. I accept that it is the Government's intention to make bomb-proof and watertight the principle that women who are dismissed on the grounds of pregnancy will always receive compensation at an industrial tribunal. I hope that that is common ground between us. If I am right in thinking that that is the Government's intention, there is at least a reasonable suspicion that it will not be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members on both sides of the Committee with experience of litigation in industrial tribunals will have dealt with cases in which it is relatively evident that the woman has been dismissed or discriminated against on grounds of pregnancy, but in which, because of the burden of proof required in an industrial tribunal, it is not possible to determine the issue. The burden of proof in industrial tribunals is the balance of probabilities. The employer has to establish only the possibility that some other reason was operative at the time of the dismissal. That is normally sufficient to suggest that, in such a case, the woman was not dismissed on grounds of pregnancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause stands unamended, and the burden of proof unaltered I am not sure that the Government will be in compliance with the decision of the European Court
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
of Justice. As with the matter discussed this morning—although it feels as if it were this afternoon—we may have to return to the matter and consider further amendments because the Government have not got it quite right. It might be a better use of our time if, when the Government introduce Bills to comply with European Court of Justice decisions, they were to proceed on the precautionary principle of ensuring as far as possible that the Bill complies with those decisions. The clause is an example of the Government doing the least that they think that they must in order to comply. That is a dangerous method of drafting legislation, because it is probably only a matter of time before that minimalist approach leads to legislation being overturned by the European Court of Justice. We may be running that risk here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If members of the Committee are concerned that the amendment proposes to change the normal burden of proof in unfair dismissal cases, I should inform them that it is not unusual for the burden of proof to be altered by unfair dismissal legislation to advance a public policy objective. For example, an employer must disprove that the employee was dismissed for one of five unfair reasons. The public policy objective in that case is to confine dismissals to five legitimate areas. There is a strong public policy argument for changing the burden of proof in pregnancy dismissals, if we are to comply fully with the terms of European case law. The reversal of the burden of proof proposed by the amendment is not unusual. It happens in many other areas of law, including other areas of unfair dismissal law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 21(4) will introduce into new section 60 of the consolidation Act a mandatory responsibility on an employer to furnish a dismissed employee with a statement of the reasons for her dismissal, even if she has not requested such a statement. That is a rather unusual legal obligation, in the absence of a request from the dismissed employee. What is the point of that? We all know that no employer who takes competent legal advice will fill out a statement that says, "I dismissed this woman because she was pregnant." In my experience, most employers are aware that any such statement would be considered to prove, if not unfair dismissal, certainly discrimination. Would it not be easier if, instead of making that mandatory responsibility incumbent on employers, we made it clear that pregnancy dismissals would automatically be regarded as unfair unless an employer was able to prove conclusively that pregnancy was not the real reason for dismissal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we consider the law on pregnancy dismissals under section 60 of the 1978 Act, our amendment, which would change the burden of proof in such cases, is not dissimilar from some important case decisions, particularly that of Brown 	<i>v.</i> Stockton borough council. In that case, the employers tried to show that the real reason for a woman's dismissal was redundancy, but it was clear that it was a pregnancy dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Burden) made clear, such cases are not supported by legal aid, so if the burden of proof remains on the female applicant, as it would normally be, that will impose an expensive obligation on her. Invariably, such cases will involve the production of evidence to an industrial tribunal on the point of establishing the reason for dismissal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
Conservative Members may say that that is fair enough because it is the normal legal process and it should apply in such cases. However, a legitimate public policy objective is involved that would justify a departure from the way in which the normal burden of proof applies in such cases because of our obligations under the treaty of Rome. The jurisprudence from Europe makes it clear that pregnancy dismissals must be considered unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the policy objective of the clause, and the amendment would make it more capable of effective enforcement by women who take complaints to industrial tribunals. It provides a sound case for changing the burden of proof that would otherwise apply in unfair dismissal cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government are at least prepared to acknowledge that the concern of the Opposition and many organisations is to ensure that the new right, which we all warmly welcome as a significant advance for women, is made an effective instrument of public policy. That will prevent women being dismissed on the ground of pregnancy and enable them to enforce that right effectively in industrial tribunals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is unnecessary and it would have little practical effect on the outcome of cases. It merely continues the old and fruitless argument on the burden of proof.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers already have to show the industrial tribunal reason for dismissal. If they cannot show reason—fair reason—that is the end of the story and dismissal will be found unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An employee will have to show that she has complained, and an industrial tribunal has jurisdiction to hear that. That is always the case, and I cannot accept that an employer should be guilty until proven innocent. However, a tribunal will investigate the grounds for dismissal and will, of course, decide whether the reason given by the employer was the real reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This issue has been gone over many times, but I cannot accept the amendment for the simple reasons that I have given. I assure the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton) that I have no doubt that the Government are fully complying with the European Court of Justice directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given an unusually hard-line response to the amendment—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that his reputation is at stake. I am puzzled by the Minister's comments because he knows that the burden of proof criterion already exists for unfair dismissal cases in relation to the pregnancy of employees who have worked for more than two years full time and five years part time. I do not understand why he is so adamant that it should not apply to women who will be covered, for the first time, by unfair dismissal legislation via the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister failed to explain that inconsistency. Does he feel that that difference is fair, especially as the Bill gives entitlements against unfair dismissal to all women who are pregnant or have given birth? Will the Minister explain that to us? My hon. Friend's points have not been fully discussed by him. It is obvious that he has not taken legal advice from Brussels because he regards that as unnecessary. Governments are often foolish to take that approach and I hope that the Government will think
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0583">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
again. Not only the Opposition but many organisations which have written to us believe that there could be a clash between the European directive and the way that the Government have implemented it in the clause. That is why we feel that it is an important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is arguable that the protection given by the Bill will not, in practice, be effective compared with normal unfair dismissal law which places the burden of proof on the employer. That is especially true given the fundamental importance, which the Minister seems to accept, of women being protected from dismissal on the ground of pregnancy or childbirth. Will the Minister further explain why he thinks this provision is unnecessary? If we are right and the burden of proof applies in cases where women have worked full time for more than two years, why should that right be denied to women who have not worked full time for two years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have much more to say. Employers already have to show the industrial tribunal the reason for dismissal. If they cannot demonstrate that the reason for dismissal was fair, that is the end of the story and the dismissal will be found to be unfair. We cannot deliver a guilty verdict before the tribunal has decided. The tribunal will decide whether it wishes to take a particular case, having heard the arguments of the parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister still has not responded to my point about the different treatment of women who have worked full time for more than two years and those who have not. Why should the burden of proof apply in one case and not in the other?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the discrimination between two groups of women. We have said all along that we do not want a two-tier system. We want a consistent system and the Minister is being inconsistent. If he cannot reply now, despite unheard voices and unseen personages, I hope that, if nothing else, he will write to me to explain the Government's position. He has not explained it so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In both cases the applicant has to establish a claim. The Bill's provisions on the burden of proof in pregnancy dismissal cases do not differ from those relating to dismissals for other reasons, which in their own context are no less unacceptable. I have in mind, for example, dismissal for membership, or non-membership, of a trade union or for trade union activities, such as carrying out the duties of a safety representative. There is no difference between the two sets of cases. An employer already has to show the reasons for dismissal to the industrial tribunal. If the employer cannot show his reasons and demonstrate that they are fair, that is the end of the story and the dismissal will be found to be unfair. If I have not managed to persuade the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I look forward to receiving the Minister's letter because there has not been an explanation.

deals with that point, it is useful that the Minister has firmly established the comparison. That will help us in our debate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may have conceded the amendments in advance. He made a link between dismissal for pregnancy and dismissal for other reasons, such as trade union activities. We are all aware that employees enjoy protection against unfair dismissal only if they have worked in one place for at least two years. However, in certain cases there is no qualifying period. For example, clause 21 mentions dismissal because of pregnancy or recent childbirth. Clause 24 makes a similar provision for health and safety cases. The final example is dismissal for trade union membership or activity. Those examples are covered in sections 152 to 154 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. The Government have accepted that employees need special protection against dismissal in such circumstances. When a person who is proved to have been dismissed for trade union membership or activities
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
requests the industrial tribunal to order his or her reinstatement, the tribunal must make a special award on top of the normal compensation award for loss of pay resulting from dismissal. That provision was presumably included in the 1992 Act to provide a deterrent against such dismissals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, the Bill provides that dismissal of an employee for health-and-safety activities attracts the deterrent of the special award. That is covered in schedule 5, which contains similar provisions to sections 152 to 154 of the 1992 Act. Why, therefore, does not the Bill provide for a special award to be made when a woman has been dismissed on the grounds of pregnancy or recent childbirth? If, as the Government have accepted, social policy or other considerations mean that pregnancy and childbirth should be bracketed with trade union and health-and-safety activities in waiving the normal qualifying periods of employment for unfair dismissal protection, why should that not also apply in deciding the remedies that are available to employees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason for tabling the amendment, and amendment No. 117 with which it is linked, is our concern that we may not be fully implementing the maternity rights directive if the Bill does not include provisions of the sort proposed. Community law requires there to be sanctions against breaches of the rights given by that and other directives, which should act as a real deterrent on the employer. The sanctions should be equivalent to protection granted in relation to comparable national rights and must be proportionate to the seriousness of the breach of Community law. The Minister himself compared the dismissal cases of pregnant women with dismissal for trade union and other activities. We therefore feel that the Government also should accept that link.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is not accepted, presumably the normal remedies for unfair dismissal will apply. However, many advice agencies have said that in the vast majority of cases compensation is based on loss of earnings and that unfair dismissal awards are generally low. The sums that I have been quoted are £1,000 to £2,000, but my hon. Friends may have supplementary information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A woman may well be unable to return to work after only 14 weeks. We have argued repeatedly that 14 weeks is too short a period and that mothers may experience great difficulties in returning to work or in finding suitable child care for babies who are only three weeks old. In those circumstances the employer may be able to limit the award by saying that the woman would have had to resign shortly after the date of her dismissal in any event, so that her loss of pay should be restricted to the period up to the date of her resignation.

In the experience of advisers working for law centres, industrial tribunals will not award compensation to women dismissed while pregnant for the period after the woman would have left to have a baby unless she had a clear right of return which she could have exercised. We talked this morning about the different positions of women who have the right to return and those who are simply covered by the 14-week rule which the Government have introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried that the awards made to women in those circumstances by industrial tribunals are likely to be very low—too low to provide a real deterrent to employers. Such awards would be seen as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
disproportionately small in relation to the fundamental importance of protection for women against dismissal on grounds of pregnancy or childbirth. The sanctions would not be equivalent to the special award protection which is granted in trade union and health-and-safety dismissal cases. The Minister made it clear in relation to amendment No. 115 that the European Commission had not been involved in discussions on that matter. Has it been contacted by the Government about this matter? If not, do the Government intend to contact it?

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that amendments Nos. 116 and 117 are to be taken together, so I shall say a little about the latter. Amendment No. 117 would provide that where dismissal occurs on the grounds of pregnancy or childbirth there should be a minimum basic unfair dismissal award. The reason for the amendment is to bring matters into line with similar provisions in cases of dismissal for trade union membership or activities. Similar considerations apply to those that I have mentioned already in relation to amendment No. 116, so I shall not go through them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An employee who is found to have been unfairly dismissed usually receives a basic award, based on calculations similar to those used in deciding on a redundancy payment, in that the amount is linked to length of service, age and gross pay. For example, an employee aged 30 who had been employed for three complete years when dismissed would be entitled to a basic award of three weeks' gross pay, subject to a ceiling—currently £205 per week—on the amount of gross pay that can be taken into account. The greater the length of service, the larger the basic award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The minimum basic award for someone proved to have been unfairly dismissed for trade union membership or activities is, irrespective of length of service, £2,700. That was, I believe, laid down in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. Presumably the intention was to create a deterrent against such dismissals, something that we would of course support. Similarly, the Bill would provide for dismissal for health-and-safety activity to attract a deterrent minimum basic award. That is covered in schedule 5 to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why, in the context that I have outlined, should not a minimum basic award be made when a woman has been dismissed on the grounds of pregnancy or childbirth? Similar considerations seem to obtain. If trade union and health-and-safety activity are important enough to warrant waiving of the normal qualifying period of employment, surely the thrust of the Bill and of all that the Government have so far said is that similar consideration should apply to women dismissed simply for pregnancy or childbirth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is not adopted, awards that tribunals might make to women for such unfair dismissal will be so small as to have no real deterrent effect. I shall give an example, using as I did before the case of a woman aged 30. If such a woman was dismissed when, say, seven months pregnant, and had at that time worked for her employer for 12 months, for gross pay of about £180 a week, she would have no statutory or contractual rights to return after the 14-week maternity leave period and would, even with an unfair dismissal award, be left with a mere £180—one week's gross pay. That is clearly a very
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
small amount for someone who has been dismissed—at a time of her life that, though possibly full of joy, could also be full of stress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already discussed the stress and time constraints faced by women when pregnant or after giving birth. It is a difficult time to begin an unfair dismissal case. If awards are to be so small, it will hardly be worth while for such women to go through the aggravation of trying to obtain justice. The awards are very small in relation to the offence that has been created. The sanctions would not be equivalent to the minimum basic award protection granted in trade union and health-and-safety dismissal cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether those issues were considered when the directive was discussed or whether the Minister has discussed them at European Commission level. They are important and it is sensible to link the amendments even though we are considering two different types of award. It makes sense to align the maternity provisions with the provisions on trade union activities and health-and-safety cases. Many hon. Members will agree that such cases are highly comparable. The Minister gave the impression that he thought that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond to the amendments. They have much to recommend them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I cannot please the hon. Lady on this occasion. I notice that she is disappointed, but she cannot have expected any other response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot agree that pregnancy-related dismissals fall into the same category as those for which enhanced compensation is already payable—dismissal for trade union reasons or under the provisions that we shall discuss shortly about designated workers that are related to special duties involving matters of health and safety. The former is a matter of conscience and health-and-safety protection has, rightly, always been accorded the highest priority. The circumstances of pregnancy dismissal do not raise such fundamental issues and there is no justification for changing the level of compensation. The Committee will know that compensation has been available for many years for dismissal on those grounds. It is obviously up to the tribunal, when considering a case, to listen to the relevant factors when coming to a decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My references to trade union dismissal and dismissals relating to health and safety were to show that even in cases that involved fundamental issues such as matters of conscience, which are not raised by pregnancy dismissal, there are no special provisions on the burden of proof.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister consider discrimination on the ground of sex to be what he describes as a fundamental issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What we have put into place are provisions to deal with cases in which someone is dismissed because of pregnancy or other cases of discrimination that are covered by legislation. That is the best way to proceed. We are now debating pregnancy dismissals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burden</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the root of the Bill is designed to ensure adequate maternity provisions and to provide protection

	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
from unfair dismissal, and if discrimination against pregnant women is a form of discrimination on the grounds of sex, does the Minister think that the Government are sending out the right message if they say that discrimination against pregnant women is less serious than discrimination against someone who does not wish to belong to a trade union? I accept the Minister's point about conscience, but is he honestly saying that discrimination on the ground of pregnancy is a lesser offence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that. We have considered the arguments and discussed the relative merits of the amendments. What I am saying is that there should not be a separate distinction for the reasons given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the Government's position. The hon. Member for Gateshead, East asked whether it is incompatible with, or meets, the terms of the directive. We are meeting the terms of the directive. The tribunals will take decisions after hearing the cases that are brought before them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friends and I are disappointed with the Minister's response. Perhaps unwisely, he made the linkage between the two types of dismissal so we suspect that he realises that it is possible to compare the two. I do not know whether the Minister missed his lunch, but he has been uncharitable this afternoon; he seems to be taking on a new persona. We hope that we can get concessions on other important matters later. Having listened to the Minister's reply, I doubt that there will ever be a meeting of minds on the subject. Although I should be happy to press the amendment to a Division, in the interests of making progress, I shall not do so.

The amendment is a drafting change to the maternity suspension provisions in schedule 3. It ensures that a woman is not regarded as suspended if she is in fact working in a suitable alternative job which she has been offered by the employer in accordance with other provisions of the schedule and new section 46.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>",and the alternative work must be of a kind which is both suitable in relation to the employee and appropriate for her to do in the circumstances and on not substantially less favourable terms and conditions.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment would ensure that a woman is not offered an alternative job with less pay and status. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
important to clarify that in the Bill. I hope that the Minister will assure us that it is covered already, but given what my hon. Friends and I have said about how employers have been known to treat pregnant women and women who have given birth, this probing amendment is necessary to get firm details from the Government that schedule 3 meets fully our worries. The amendment is self-explanatory, so I shall say no more now and let the Minister respond.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the fears expressed by the hon. Member for Gateshead, East would be realised in practice. The drafting follows that of the provisions in the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 relating to medical suspension, which have caused no difficulties since their introduction in 1975. It is difficult to conceive that an industrial tribunal would conclude that a job which offered significantly worse terms than the employee's usual work, or which was otherwise unsuitable or inappropriate for her, met the requirements of the provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing between us on the protection that we all seek to provide. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Quin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seek clarification from the Government and want reassurance about the details of the schedule. The amendment would replace "be paid remuneration by" with "full pay from". We hope that that reflects the schedule's intention. We are anxious that a woman who is offered an alternative job is not paid a reduced salary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 120 emphasises the importance of maintaining an employee's contractual rights. I hope that the Minister will assure us that that is the schedule's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McLoughlin</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can persuade the hon. Lady to withdraw the amendments, which are unnecessary. The schedule provides for full pay during maternity suspension. "Remuneration" is defined in new section 47(3) to the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 as "a week's pay". Under schedule 14 to the 1978 Act, that is calculated in line with normal pay. There is no definition of "full pay", and the amendment would only confuse matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employee's contract continues while she is suspended. She is employed and may not be dismissed.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>431</span>
Her contractual rights are maintained. No special provision for that is required, just as the measure does not need to provide for the continuation of an employee's contract while he or she takes annual leave. Amendment No. 120 could throw into doubt an employee's entitlement to be paid more than the amount to which her contract might entitle her while she is suspended. The amendment would, therefore, conflict with the provisions on pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 131, in page 63, line 29, leave out from beginning to end of line 21 on page 64.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are making exponential progress and I shall not slow it down, especially on schedule 4, which significantly extends employees' rights. We welcome that. It grants employees who work for more than eight hours a week the right to an itemised statement. That statement must be received within two months and significantly improves the current position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Opposition have three main anxieties, to which the amendment relates. We are worried about items that are excluded from the statement, items that are denied to those who work fewer than eight hours a week and discrimination against those who insist on their statutory rights but are excluded from taking their case to an industrial tribunal by section 64 of the 1978 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first amendment deals with items excluded under schedule 4(3), which states:—
	<br><blockquote><p>"No statement need be given under subsection (1) if'</p></blockquote>
and there follows the usual lawyers daft gobbledegook. It means that the statement excludes details about the incapacity to work pension rights, disciplinary procedures and statements that refer to other documents. That seems like double standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, we discussed check-off and the various rights of an individual employee. The lawyer had to be informed of and had to consent to any change. But the subsection places a duty on the employer to do something. Fairly significant changes relating to rights about the incapacity to work, pensions, discipline and so on will occur without employees having a further statement of their rights. That concerns us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are pleased with the clause and the schedule, but we want to ensure that nothing is excluded from the rights of employees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
In the White Paper, "People, Jobs and Opportunities", it was proposed that part of the statement would also include the employers' training and development policy, yet that has been taken out of the schedule. The Minister may like to tell us why. Training and development is an essential part of the economic development and infrastructure of this society. Therefore, there is concern over the omission. We would particularly like to know why there are the exclusions in paragraph 3 of the schedule. They are important matters for each and every individual employee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department of Employment (Mr. Michael Forsyth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is on to something there. I cannot think of an argument that I could deploy to deal with his question about the double standard of requiring employees to be informed about changes in their trade union subscription and other matters—with which we have already dealt in the Bill—yet not to be informed of a material change in something as important as their pension, sickness, discipline or grievance procedures. I go some way towards supporting the hon. Gentleman's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deletion of subsections (3) and (4) would place an additional burden on employers, but I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that it would benefit employees to know that they would be properly informed, should there be changes in such matters as those covered by subsections (3) and (4). I shall be happy to give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking to bring forward an amendment on Report to meet his objection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deletion of subsections (5) and (6) would require a full new statement of terms and conditions if there were a change of employer, even if the terms and conditions were the same. That is overegging the pudding and unnecessary. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman feels able to withdraw the amendment and to look forward to a Government amendment at Report stage, which would meet his requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me about the training policy, which he rightly said was referred to in the White Paper that we published before the election. Some representations were not very enthusiastic. Like the hon. Gentleman, I think that it is important that employers develop effective training policies, inform employees about the opportunities that are available to them, and, where appropriate, involve trade unions in encouraging the take-up of training opportunities. The best way to achieve that is through the non-statutory route of the "investors in people" programme, which we are trying to promote—we are enjoying some success. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be reassured and feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the Minister has received representations to remove training and development from the statement because many employers do not have a training and development policy, so it would be nonsense and a further embarrassment to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not include paragraphs 5 and 6 in the amendment. If there is just a change of employer, why should there be any change in terms and conditions? When there is a change of employer, such as in a takeover, employees often feel threatened because that is associated with a deterioration in conditions. It would be desirable to have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
a statement that their former conditions will remain. However, I appreciate that it would be difficult to ensure that that is legally binding from one employer to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exclusions are the most important part of the amendment. I am grateful to the Minister for giving me his views. I should be happy to withdraw the amendment so that we can continue with the exponential progress that we are making.

	<br><blockquote><p>"7. The right to an itemised pay statement given in accordance with sections 8 to 10 shall not apply to an employee if he is employed under a contract which normally involves employment for less than eight hours weekly.".</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Tiverton (Mrs. Browning) will speak on a subject with which we have dealt in an amendment that was not selected because of its technical irregularities, so I shall delay my discussion of that until after she has spoken. We have the same aim as the hon. Lady, although our amendment provides for a more extended period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 130 is designed to give the rights under the clause to those working fewer than eight hours a week. Currently 700,000 employees work fewer than eight hours a week. Why are those employees excluded from this important development? I realise that there may come a time when it is necessary to have a cut-off point—that is an arbitrary decision and I am not quibbling about that—but I wonder whether it is right in this case to have a cut-off point. If people are properly employed, they should be entitled to a statement irrespective of their hours of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be argued that this provision would be a burden on the employer. Opposition Members cannot balk at that because every time a duty was imposed on trade unions, we argued that it was a burden. Perhaps there could be a meeting of minds on this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State has already agreed that even if a provision would be a burden on an employer, that is not necessarily a reason for not introducing it. I ask him to consider whether this arbitrary cut-off is relevant. The Minister previously conceded that where small numbers were involved, it would be unnecessary to appoint scrutineers for various ballots. But the right to have a statement of the particulars of employment is appropriate, even if people are working fewer than eight hours a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most employers provide a written statement well within two months—usually, immediately employment commences. That is good practice, so why cannot it be the norm? Why wait two months?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to consider the problem that arises under the transitional arrangements in schedule 8. An existing employee is not entitled to that right unless
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
he or she asks for it. An existing employee who does not already have a written statement should be given the right automatically after the Bill is enacted. The next amendment I shall move would give that right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New employees in a company will have a written statement of their employment particulars but existing employees will not. That cannot be fair. The onus should not be on individuals to ask for a statement but should be on the employer to provide one. An existing employee will be at an unfair disadvantage as a result of not having a statement and will risk incurring the wrath and disfavour of his employer by demanding one. I shall expand on that issue in the debate on the following amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Angela Browning 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Tiverton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We appreciate the fact that the conditions of people who work part time, especially those who work between eight and 16 hours a week, have been enhanced by a statement of their terms and conditions of employment. The clause provides that that group will also be given an itemised statement of pay. At present, that is required only for those working more than 16 hours a week or those who have been employed for five or more years who work between eight and 16 hours a week. That might seem somewhat anachronistic. As the trend is towards part-time working, especially for women, it is important that everyone who has deductions from pay, and who in future may have to prove them either to the Inland Revenue or to the Benefits Agency, has written proof of those deductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about some cases, details of which have been circulated to members of the Committee. They show the difficulties that employees face when they have not been provided with a detailed statement. The employers are unable to process claims for pension rights and other benefits. It is a criminal offence for information about deductions made from an employee's pay not to be passed to the Inland Revenue or the Benefits Agency. There is a financial onus on employees who cannot produce documentary evidence to show that the deductions were legitimately made from their pay packet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will take into account the trend for people who work between eight and 16 hours a week to have more than one part-time job. There may thus be an aggregate liability to prove to the Inland Revenue or to other Government agencies a person's aggregate earnings in a particular period. Unless that information is given in writing, employees can find themselves in serious difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Audit Office reported a large-scale under-collection of national insurance contributions. That has consequences not only for employees but for the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister carefully to consider including the amendment with the other improvements to this part of the Bill. An employer will have to keep documentary records of salaries and deductions for his own taxation purposes. It should therefore not be too burdensome to the employer simply to transfer that information to a small piece of paper so that employees, too, have documentary evidence of money that has been deducted from their pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing to add to the hon. Lady's comments. She has made the case for extending the right to itemised pay slips. We tabled an amendment with a similar purpose to that of the hon. Lady's—to extend the provision to any employee, even if employed for fewer than eight hours a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady made great play of national insurance contributions and whether they are deducted. The lower earnings limit is approximately £54 and it is possible to work fewer than eight hours a week and still qualify. National insurance deductions should be itemised. Some employers—usually smaller companies—do not pay the national insurance contributions after deducting it from employees, and that may happen to people who work fewer than eight hours a week. We would satisfied with an amendment covering national insurance contributions and entitling people to itemised pay slips if they come within the lower earnings limit for national insurance contributions for working fewer than eight hours a week. The Minister must prevent further such abuses by a few employers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman tried to tempt me to require an employer to provide a statement for employees on request, regardless of the number of hours worked. There may be an argument for doing so, but statements would have to be produced for employees who work perhaps only one or two hours a week. That would be a considerable burden on employers and employees might be astonished to receive rather a lot of paper. The hon. Gentleman might start a paperchase and is perhaps in danger of ruining a good case by pressing it too far. Even the European Commission accepted that eight hours was an appropriate limit for the proof of employment directive. Much as I would like to help the hon. Gentleman, I cannot accept the amendment or agree to further consideration of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why existing employees would not automatically receive a statement and why they would have to request one. Employees who work the appropriate number of hours already receive a written statement, and those who work fewer hours and do not currently receive a statement would be entitled to do so on request. The hon. Gentleman is asking me to consider the position of those employees who work more than eight hours and less than 16 hours a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. The schedule also extends the information contained in the statement of particulars to include work overseas, relevant collective agreements, duration of employment and so on. Such details will not be available on the statement of employment particulars which people who work more than 16 hours a week will have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that Ministers are not supposed to admit that they did not see something in their own Bill, but the issue raised by the hon. Gentleman is a new one to me, although not to my officials. The hon. Gentleman has identified a group of people who will have to request a statement because they do not receive one under then-present statutory rights and will not do so under the Bill. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a commitment to change that. The advice that I am being given relates to the burdens on business. The effect of what the hon. Gentleman proposes is that all employees who are
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
employed for more than eight hours but less than 16 would have to be written to and the material provided in one go. That would cost a significant amount.

Having said that, I understand that the issue troubles the hon. Gentleman, so I shall consider his arguments further and examine what the compliance costs would be. Without giving any commitment to do anything on Report, I promise that if it seems appropriate to make changes, I shall reconsider. If the hon. Gentleman withdraws the amendment, he may wish to return to the issue later in our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman associated himself with the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton to offer it support rather than to make me feel nervous about it. There seems to be cross-party agreement about the amendment, which probably means that it is wrong. Having listened to my hon. Friend's arguments, I am attracted to the issues that both she and the hon. Gentleman raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, we are discussing an additional cost being imposed on employers. I am not certain what the costs or the implications would be. We have had no opportunity to discuss the idea with any of the organisations which represent small businesses, which would be affected by the proposal. If my hon. Friend will withdraw the amendment, we can pursue her idea with outside groups which take an interest in these matters, and reach a conclusion. If my hon. Friend wishes to discuss the idea further with small business organisations, in which I know she has played an important and prominent part, we could return to the issue on Report. On that basis, without commitment and without ruling out her proposals, I hope that my hon. Friend will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by my hon. Friend's comments and shall do all that I can to provide him with the relevant information between now and Report. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady was misled by the Minister. Her amendment has not been proposed, so she does not need to withdraw it. Instead, she will not put it to a vote in due course. The fault was entirely the Minister's and not the hon. Lady's.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Browning</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Knox.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy with the Minister's comments. I realise that he cannot give a commitment and I am happy that he will examine my proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the sake of pleasure, I shall refer to the inconsistency with which we are dealing. In the first part of the Bill, the Minister was only too happy to impose burden after burden and cost after cost on trade unions, but the minute that the burdens are placed on business men and employers, the Government throw up their hands in horror. The Minister is not daft and will realise the inconsistency. However, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 133, in page 64, line 38, at end add:—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V007P0I0590">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"7.—(1) Where an employer does not give an employee a written statement of employment particulars as required by section 1 of this Act, the employee may require a reference to be made to an industrial tribunal.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) When making a claim to an industrial tribunal under section 7(1) above, the employee shall have the right not to be dismissed unfairly by his employer.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) Section 64 of this Act shall not apply where an employee makes a claim for unfair dismissal under section 7(1) above.".</p></blockquote>
I consider this the most important amendment to the schedule. We are trying to ensure that someone who asks for his statutory rights as laid out in the schedule—the right to a written statement—is not unfairly dismissed and can take the appeal further to an industrial tribunal. Section 64 of the 1978 Act requires someone to have been employed for 26 weeks before that can happen. If an employee did not get a statement within two months, it would be ridiculous if he had to wait for 26 months before complaining, in case the complaint led to dismissal against which he would not be able to appeal to an industrial tribunal because he had not been long enough in employment. We must ensure that an employee is protected against being dismissed because he has asked for his statutory right. That would apply also to the "existing employee" under schedule 8. Existing employees employed between eight and 16 hours a week might have to go to their employers and ask for a new statement. The employer could regard that request with disfavour and may even dismiss the employee on the basis—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the hon. Gentleman's point about existing employees, those employees who work more than 16 hours have already had a written statement under the existing statutory provision. The group that he has identified comprises those employees who work between eight and 16 hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I had identified both groups of employees: those who worked between eight and 16 hours with no statement, and those who work more than 16 hours and who have a statement that does not contain all the information included in the schedule. Those employees are entitled to that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can understand how a company employee might fear going to an employer to ask for a statement. The request might be looked on with disfavour and the employee might be dismissed. If an employee has been employed for less than two years, he will not be able to take his case to an industrial tribunal. That is the reason for the amendment. We tabled two amendments, one of which, for technical reasons has not been selected. I hope, however, that the Minister realises that the amendments aim is to ensure that even though employees employed for less than two years with the same firm, under section 64 of the 1978 Act, do not qualify to go to an industrial tribunal, they will be protected. It would be unfair if they had to wait two years before taking issue with the employer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman complains that one rule applies for part I of the Bill and another for schedule 4, he tempts me to introduce a range of special privileges and immunities for employers which are already enjoyed by trade unions. The hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
cannot make a case for trade unions having immunities which do not apply to any other groups and then complain when the Government distinguish between the law as it stands for trade unions and for companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendment is important, although as it stands it relates particularly to the right to a statement on terms and conditions and the value and enforcement of that right when the qualifying period has not been reached. Someone could go along and say, "I am exercising my right to a statement of terms and conditions" and the employer could say, "And there's the door." If the employee had not reached the qualifying period, he could be dismissed. That point was made in several cases reported by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux. That report—I know that it impressed the hon. Gentleman—goes beyond the amendment's provisions, which are limited to the right to terms and conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right to say that some amendments were not selected for technical reasons. Those amendments dealt with the same issue—that is, that the Bill provides people with rights, but those rights may not be obtainable and, in trying to obtain the rights from an employer, the employee may be open to dismissal. Only a bad employer would behave in that way. Citizens advice bureaux tend to deal with the worst cases, just as cases tend to be referred to Members of Parliament only as a last resort. None the less, the hon. Gentleman has made an important point. I shall consider the amendment and propose an appropriate provision on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall also reflect on the wider issues raised by the hon. Gentleman and give them serious thought. I shall also consider the other rights contained in the Bill and decide whether it would be appropriate to extend protection in the way that the hon. Gentleman has suggested. I hope that he will withdraw the amendment so that the Committee can conclude consideration of the schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased with that reassurance from the Minister. I shall not be here next Tuesday morning when the Committee will discuss health and safety, so I should be grateful if the Minister would agree to consider also conferring similar rights during the two-year qualifying period. Although it is unusual for someone who is not two-years qualified to be in charge of health and safety, it can happen, particularly in connection with North sea operations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I know that he has to go into hospital. I am sure that I speak for the whole Committee in wishing him well. I shall consider the new rights on health and safety contained in the Bill. I cannot promise to deliver, but no doubt the hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to remind me about it when he returns to take part in the Committee's deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
