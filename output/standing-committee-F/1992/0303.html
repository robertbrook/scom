	<p>[MR. NORMAN HOGG 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Freedom and Responsibility of the Press Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i></p>
	<p>That during the proceedings on the Freedom and Responsibility of the Press Bill the Committee do meet on Wednesdays at half-past Ten o'clock,—	<i>[Mr. Soley.]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call clause 1 I should remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution in connection with the Bill, and copies are available in this Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Denton and Reddish)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. I have examined the selection paper because I had hoped that new clause 1 would be selected. I assume that its absence from the list is due, not to your not having completed the selection but to your having decided against selecting new clause 1. If that is so, may I express some disappointment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate, having discussed the matter, that there are difficulties with the new clause, but some hon. Members—certainly some Opposition Members—believe that the press should have been given a last chance. They would like a mechanism to enable the prospect of the legislation to hang over the press in case the voluntary procedures did not work. It would be implemented only if the Secretary of State was satisfied that the last chance had failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bringing in to force of the Act would entail the danger of giving the Secretary of State wide powers through regulations, so a mechanism by which the Act would lapse would be desirable. I have tried to achieve these ends in the new clause, but I realise that a difficulty exists, in that it is not very specific about how press failure to reach the required terms would be assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do you, Mr. Hogg, consider the new clause to be an unacceptable approach; or would it be possible, with some effort by the Government or the Opposition, to reach a longer definition of failure to meet the objectives of the legislation and, to draw up a new clause that would be acceptable to you, at least for debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for explaining why he tabled the new clause. I shall try to explain why I have not selected it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause seems intended to suspend the operation of the Bill, once enacted. That makes the hon. Gentleman's proposal a wrecking new clause, which would defeat the purpose of the Bill. For that reason it may not be selected. However, the hon. Gentleman,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
like me, is long in the tooth in this place. He can, of course, have another stab at achieving his objectives with another new clause, which I should of course consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clive Soley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hammersmith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Hogg. There is a typing error in amendment No. 1, which includes the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"to receive and import information and ideas".</p></blockquote>
"Import" should read "impart". If I want to enact the Bill, I must not add to the Government's balance of payments problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We can accept that it should read "impart".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bennett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my point of order, Mr. Hogg. I understand your view that new clause 1 is a wrecking amendment. However, if a Bill or an 'Act of Parliament were able to achieve its purpose without coming into force, I would find it difficult to accept the suggestion that that the new clause is a wrecking amendment. Your remarks, Mr. Hogg, are helpful. You will see that amendment No. 5 goes some way to meeting the aims of the new clause even though it does not place in the Bill the reasoning that I was able to set out in the new clause. I hope that at an early stage—perhaps on the clause 1 stand part debate—we shall hear from the Government about their attitude to the Bill. It will then become much easier to frame a new clause, if that is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is being characteristically helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>THE INDEPENDENT PRESS AUTHORITY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may help the Committee if I spend a few moments on this important clause. I wish to draw the Committee's attention to some of the ideas underlying the Bill without again going over the Second Reading debate. The Committee will be relieved to know that I am seeking to avoid doing that. However, it would be helpful if the Secretary of State responded to a number of points. I am grateful to him for attending the Committee, as we all acknowledge that it deals with an important area of debate in British public life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 will set up a new statutory body—the independent press authority. The schedule describes how it will be set up, and an amendment has been tabled, but not yet been chosen. I shall work on the amendment between now and next Wednesday so that we can consider it, because suggestions have been made that the authority should be set up at arm's length from the Secretary of State. That is what the amendment will achieve if I am able to frame it within the terms of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will see that the clause covers newspapers and periodicals. That has always
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
been the intended definition: there is no change on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to repeat what I and other hon. Members said on Second Reading, but I wish to say a little about the issue of accuracy. There has been discussion of whether accuracy is the key factor or whether the Bill should introduce a privacy law. I have settled on the concept of accuracy because that is an important way of raising standards in the press. Hon. Members should know that the vast majority of complaints are made about accuracy in the press. The old saying that one cannot believe what one reads in the papers—even the date on the top of the page may be suspect—is bad news for journalism and for a free press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can raise standards of accuracy, editors, sub-editors and journalists will check their facts, and in doing so they will attain a higher standard of journalism. One of the points that emerged from the evidence given to the committee that I set up as a voluntary body, on which hon. Members served, was the view that standards were higher in the electronic media because journalists and editors had to make checks more often. Broadcasting legislation requires journalists in the electronic media to report accurately and impartially. I shall refer again to that point later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key to the majority of complaints is accuracy; 66 per cent, of the complaints made to the Press Complaints Commission were about that. Most people who write to me do so to complain about accuracy. It is important to note that many of the cases that were discussed by my committee began as stories that contained a significant inaccuracy which then led to abuses by the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have circulated to members of the Committee a report of the proceedings of my informal committee and if they consider it they will see reference to the case of Linda Townley, Princess Anne's maid. That case began with what was a crucial inaccuracy, in as much as she was alleged to have stolen letters from Princess Anne. That allegation, which was not corrected quickly, led to greater intrusion by the press into her private life to try to discover the location and content of the letters. The press obviously hoped for additional stories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause would provide a power to correct, which I shall discuss because it was little debated on Second Reading and it is important. Attempting to fine newspapers was discussed by Sir David Calcutt in his report and by others concerned with press intrusion and behaviour. I am not opposed to fining newspapers, but it would be a dangerous course of action to take. It has been said that the Select Committee on National Heritage, like Calcutt, may recommend fining newspapers for any breach of the code. That would make good investigative journalists look over their shoulders at every clause in the code—it may contain 40 or 50—and at libel. I have always been worried about such an approach. It would be a gift to the Robert Maxwells of this world, making it more difficult to expose such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
The beauty of making the press put things right is that all that it would have to do is make a correction. That would not only raise standards, but make the press put things right in the papers. Restraints on good investigative journalism would not be imposed. That lies at the heart of the clause. The Bill intends to secure a free press and promote professional and ethical standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been argument about the question of accuracy. I want to repeat certain core arguments. When I began my campaign almost a year ago after being selected in the ballot in April or May, a lot of editors said, "You cannot adjudicate on accuracy." That was an incredible argument to use. It was not credible because accuracy is dealt with by article 1 of the Press Complaints Commission code, which shows how seriously the matter is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 1 refers to newspapers having a duty to correct factual inaccuracies. The argument is not whether errors can be corrected—the press accepts that that can be done, despite what was said initially. The central, essential argument is about who adjudicates. Should there be self-adjudication, with newspapers judging themselves through a body dominated by press people? Or should an independent body adjudicate? It is central to my argument that bodies that are set up to adjudicate themselves never gain the confidence of the public or of complainants. There is always a feeling that vested interests are at work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has also been argued that the correction of inaccuracies should not be worried about and that their occasional printing is part and parcel of having a free press. Such errors have been described as being par for the course and something that we live with. There are fundamental arguments against that. As members of the Committee are aware, people suffer when gross inaccuracies are printed. The Linda Townley case and many others which were recorded at my informal hearing are examples of people's lives being severely damaged by inaccurate press reporting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask members of the Committee to bear it in mind throughout our debates that there is a citizen's right to expect accuracy in news reporting, which is an important general principle. A free press should inform a democracy. If the press deliberately or accidently distorts the facts in the course of reporting factual information, it is poisoning democracy. Accurate news reporting is the oxygen of democracy—poisoning that oxygen poisons the democracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that people have a right to expect accuracy. I see it as a basic right, but it can also be seen as a customer's right. I have made the point several times that someone who buys a packet of tea and discovers that it contains sawdust has access to all sorts of complaints procedures. Yet although accurate news reporting is much more important than a packet of tea, people are expected to put up with inaccuracies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have referred to the case—and shall do so again from time to time—of Mr. and Mrs. McKeever from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0296">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
Northern Ireland. They read a story in the press saying that their 10-year-old son who was suffering from a particular form of muscular dystrophy would have a cure within one year. Their hopes were raised dramatically, but the story was inaccurate. Evidence of that case was given to my committee. It was a classic example of the citizen's right to accuracy. People should not have to expect to put up with that sort of inaccurate news reporting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is argued that the press gets its facts but prints corrections if necessary. The evidence against the press is overwhelming. Many people complain about the press to the Press Complaints Commission. In addition, opinion polls show that a very large percentage of the public do not believe what they read in the press. That does the press no good at all. One problem is that people are more inclined to believe the electronic media than the printed word. That too is bad news for press freedom. I do not think that the press gets its facts rights. It could help itself a great deal if it was much more willing to print corrections and respond positively to complaints.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause implies that the Press Complaints Commission has not worked. I know that I have the Secretary of State on my side; he has conceded that the Press Complaints Commission, as constituted and operating, has not worked and is not working. When I imported hon. Members from all parties to cross-examine witnesses, there was significant evidence to suggest that people felt that the commission could not work. In her evidence, Baroness Hollis, who was a member of the former Press Commission, gave reasons for suggesting that the new PCC could not work in its present format. Under pressure from editors, the Press Complaints Commission watered down the proposals made under the former Press Commission to give editors greater power in determining what was acceptable behaviour in press reporting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general feeling is that the Press Complaints Commission has failed. The Bill is so far the only measure available to put an alternative body in place. The Secretary of State is reluctant to go down the statutory road. I understand that and, in an ideal world, it would not be necessary. However, what do we do if we do not set up a body as proposed in clause 1? We either follow the recommendations of Sir David Calcutt, which I believe bear down too heavily on press freedom, or we find a middle way. There has been talk of a press ombudsman and an ability to fine, but I have already pointed out the dangers of those suggestions. If there is no middle way, why not opt for an independent statutory body? After all, it has worked extremely well for the electronic media. The BBC, and ITV—indeed, British radio and television in general—are very highly regarded around the world. They are regulated by a committee set up by the Home Secretary, No one accuses the BBC and ITV of being gagged or controlled by the Government. There have been occasional worries and complaints, but overall the BBC and ITV are regarded as providing a higher standard of journalism, which is more than capable of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
carrying out investigations into the affairs of the Government and the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case for an independent press authority is strong. It should be established by statute because the alternatives tend to fall down. The blunderbuss approach of fining newspapers heavily, or introducing a new civil tort for privacy, or restricting photography and bugging—none of these is satisfactory. I am sympathetic in principle, but we must bear in mind the erosion of press freedom in recent years—I shall say more about that when we discuss amendment No. 1. An independent press authority with status is a better approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me cite some examples, taken from recent press coverage, to demonstrate not only that the press has not reformed, as it keeps claiming that it has, but that the press Complaints Commission has seriously failed. My first example is the sad case of Jamie Bulger. The headline in 	<i>The Sun</i> was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Boy 12 Is Held For Jamie Murder."</p></blockquote>
That refers not to one of the two boys who were charged with murder, but to a possible witness. The strange thing is that 	<i>The Sun</i> got the facts right in the story and quoted the police as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'We are nowhere near that. We have not got the murderer in these cells at this stage.' "</p></blockquote>
That is clear in the story, but the headline is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Boy 12 Is Held For Jamie Murder."</p></blockquote>
The story reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A 100-strong mob gathered outside the home in Snowdrop Street, Kirkdale, Merseyside, as the youngster was led away, covered by a blanket … Neighbours of the arrested 12-year-old said his family moved into the £85-a-week home, run by the DSS, less than two months ago."</p></blockquote>
One neighbour was quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'I thought they were gipsies. The father used to cook soup on a stove in the back yard and the kids ran around shouting for more. They were a real low life family.' "</p></blockquote>
So a boy is being held as a witness in a desperately serious case that has aroused enormous passions, and 	<i>The Sun</i> is saying, in effect—I do not accuse it of intending to—that we should not wait to see whether he is guilty, but lynch him now. The slant to the story is almost guaranteed to raise public feeling. It is no wonder that the family were not able to return to their home, even though the boy involved was never accused of murder. There cannot be a better example of why accuracy is important.

over many years to my anxiety about the press calling people pro-IRA or anti-police just because they maintained that the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, for example, were innocent. We know now that those groups of people were innocent and that our criminal justice system had gone badly off the rails. The Government must deal with the problems of how press inaccuracy distorts judicial proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to the case of the Taylor sisters, who were convicted of the murder of the woman whom the alleged lover of one of the sisters had married. The headline in 	<i>The Sun</i>—the story appeared in other papers also—read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The 'Killer' Mistress Who Was At Lover's Wedding."</p></blockquote>
There follows photograph and subheading:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Hatred made her stab bride Alison 54 times, court told."</p></blockquote>
The wording of the story is technically accurate. It reports what the court was told. However, the presentation of the story forces the conclusion that the sisters were the killers. The story reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It was bride Alison Shaughnessy's day of joy. But standing among her wedding guests was her bridegroom's secret lover who was to murder her, the Old Bailey heard yesterday … Eleven months after the wedding Michelle used a knife five inches long and an inch wide to kill her love rival in her home in Battersea, South West London."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Carttiss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Great Yarmouth)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am sympathetic to his general theme. However, how does he suggest that we can deal with the fact that the public have a right to know what is being said in court, unless the court has determined that the proceedings shall be in camera?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to that. The trial concluded on 24 July 1992 and the sisters were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Their solicitors wrote to me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On our clients' instructions we lodged Notices of Appeal and before the Single Judge, The Honourable Mrs. Justice Bracewell, leave to appeal was granted"—</p></blockquote>
this is the import part—
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the basis that the coverage by the press of our clients' trial was of such a nature that they may not have received a fair trial. Indeed, the Learned Judge indicated that she was concerned over the volume of press reporting which she was shown and the quality of it…</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Whilst we expected a great deal of publicity we did not perhaps anticipate the volume and torrent of publicity which appeared to be overwhelming. The first complaint we have to make on behalf of our clients is that whilst the Prosecution was opening its case and their witnesses giving their evidence, massive publicity attended these events but when it came to the turn of the defence equal prominence in the majority of papers was not given to the defence case.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>We take the view, and this will be argued in the Court of Appeal in due course, that the type of headlines employed and not always based on evidence heard in Court could be misleading particularly for a juryman who might not be able to distinguish between what he had heard in Court or what he had read in his paper or seen on television."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Carttiss) asked a valid question: what to do about that? The solicitor suggests that one possibility is to adopt the Scottish system, in which reporting restrictions are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
much tighter. Although I do not rule out the Scottish solution, I think that it would be better to have a code of conduct that is respected. The problem is that the Press Complaints Commission does not regard itself as having a role in such a case. It does not believe that it has the power, the duty or the need to say that such reporting is distorting the criminal justice system and risking the possibility of wrongful conviction. When I have finished citing my examples, I shall expand on what I think has gone wrong with the Press Complaints Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third case is also relatively recent and involves the tragic suicide of the wife of Sir Allan Green, the former Director of Public Prosecutions who resigned after approaching a prostitute in the King's Cross area. A series of photographs appeared in the papers the day after her body had been found. They showed the prostitute approaching the wife, following her to her front door, and looking at the camera. Several other photographs show the prostitute approaching the wife. They were tragic examples of what goes wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I obtained information about what happened from a newspaper. Initially, the prostitute's pimp approached a newspaper asking for money for information about the prostitute. One newspaper said that it refused to pay. I can only guess at what happened next. Given that the photographs were taken, I suspect that one of two things occurred. The pimp either approached a freelance photographer or a freelance photographer approached the pimp. In my judgment, it is more likely to have been the latter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prostitute was taken to the house to await the wife's arrival, at which time she approached her, the underlying story being that she was to say sorry. Photographs were then taken—to the great distress of the wife who refused to talk to the prostitute. I do not believe that money was not paid for that. Whoever organised the encounter, newspapers would have paid the freelance photographer. I am almost certain that part of the money went to the pimp; it probably did not go to the prostitute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To the great distress of her family and friends, the photographs were used after the wife committed suicide. The article was published, to no obvious story or free-press advantage. After all, the wife was not involved in the incident over which Sir Allan resigned. It was nothing to do with her, besides the fact that she was his wife. The article, however, appeared on the front page. My objection is that the Press Complaints Commission again did nothing, although it is supposed to be the public watchdog.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fourth example comes from my constituency. The story was published under the headline, "You Bitch" and was about the so-called "Home Alone" mother who went to Spain and left her child in the flat. Hon. Members may have seen the photographs in the paper of the crying mother being brought back from Spain. Incidentally, she was brought back by a newspaper. The article stated:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"But the brassy blonde shrugged off any ideas of returning to the 11-year-old daughter she callously left in London."</p></blockquote>
Such remarks are the equivalent of stoning. I am not justifying the mother's action; it is beside the point. If we want to encourage people to start stoning others, let us at least do it openly. One does not need to be a psychiatrist or a social worker to realise that both the mother and the child had problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authorities took out an injunction in respect of the photographs. Pictures of the child were shown on television. Given that the incident happened in my constituency, I began to wonder how those pictures were obtained, when an injunction had been taken out. The 	<i>Evening Standard</i> published photographs just before the injunction was granted. Completely unjustifiably, it used the names of the child and the mother in its article, thus identifying them. It also used pictures that were obtained either from the girl's school or from an agency, given that the mother was an actress. The girl's school was a private school that taught music and dancing. It offered photographs—or, at least, photographs were obtained from it. That is unacceptable. The other tabloids went to the judge who had issued the injunction and argued that it was unfair to place them under a restriction when the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> had published the material. The judge said that it seemed unfair and allowed the papers to use the material. He accorded only limited rights, as he forbade them to approach the child. By that time either the head teacher or another person, through the school, had allowed the video of the child in school to be used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One story quoted a teacher as saying that the child had bruises—I understand the teacher denied saying that. Physical abuse was implied but it was not known whether that was true. It was part of a whipped-up story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People sometimes ask me why I am trying to set up an independent press authority, as the clause requires, when the Press Complaints Commission already exists. The cases that I have mentioned show that the press is not cleaning up its act and that in each instance, when an obvious case arose for intervention by a public watchdog—as the PCC is supposed to be—it did not even bark, let alone bite. In none of those cases did it say, "Such behaviour is unacceptable." In the Jamie case, for example, it did not say, "This is inaccurate." Apparently we are to wait until an individual makes a complaint. I understand that a complaint about the Jamie case is being made from Liverpool. Imagine what would happen if, because the commission often will not take third party complaints, a friend or relative of the people whom I have mentioned had to make the complaint. Is it fair to place people in that position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A pro-active body of the kind that clause 1 would set up, is vital to tackle the problem. A crucial point, which I make partly in answer to the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth, is that the independent press authority must be able to take the initiative and declare that reporting, such as that used in the Taylor case for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
example, is likely to prevent a fair trial. If a body stated that in the public domain, the matter would be debated in that domain. That would put pressure on the press to behave more responsibly. The independent press authority is vital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case that I mention in passing was that of Ann Sole, whose fiance was murdered in Florida. Inaccurate quotations were used and privacy was invaded during the funeral after the body was flown back to Britain. In the case of the Tornado pilot, Flight Lieutenant Nicholl, quotations were invented for his parents on his release from an Iraqi jail. Such cases all show that the Press Complaints Commission is not working. I have spoken at length to save time later in the Committee. My argument is that the commission has not worked and cannot work. An independent body is needed. The heart of the Bill is the independent press authority and its vital joint functions of raising standards and protecting press freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several people have written to me suggesting the setting up of a support group for people who receive press treatment of the kind that I have described. We are discussing doing so, but I should like to think that that would not be necessary. I hope that the Committee is minded to support the measure. It would be helpful if the Secretary of State would tell us his thoughts about the way in which the Bill should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the structure set out in clause 1, we will not crack the difficult problem of press responsibility and freedom. That is why I have spent some time on it. It is a vital part of the Bill and it is vital that it should be part of any future Government legislation. Without it, we will not be able to deal with the case that I have described. They are not easily dealt with by legislation on privacy or photography. They are best dealt with by a code drawn up by an independent body that has status and support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the difficult case of the contrived photograph of Sir Allan Green's wife and a prostitute? How would the hon. Gentleman expect the proposed statutory body to deal with such a case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would expect the statutory body to make an ex cathedra statement. The hon. Gentleman may recall that Lord McGregor did that on one occasion and made history for the Press Complaints Commission by commenting on the reporting of the royal family. He then had his wrists slapped fairly firmly because the press knew that the royal family was co-operating with them. Lord McGregor's duty then was to inform the public that the press knew what was happening rather than leave us in the dark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Returning to the case mentioned, I would expect the statutory body to issue an ex cathedra statement stating that it is wrong to set up a photograph that intrudes on the grief of a person who is not directly involved in a story. I would also expect it to write to the newspapers that used the photograph to ask who they paid to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
obtain it and how they could be sure that the money was not given to a pimp. Perhaps it would be an interesting case for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether the newspapers had paid a pimp for services rendered in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Secretary of State for National Heritage (Mr. Peter Brooke)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr. Soley), who opened the clause stand part debate, asked me a specific question and, obviously, I want to respond to it. It may be helpful if I make some remarks on behalf of the Government so that the debate is not prematurely terminated. At the outset, I thank the hon. Member for Hammersmith for his kind remarks about my attendance in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 1 would give the proposed independent press authority a general remit to seek accuracy in the presentation of news by newspapers and periodicals, and to secure free dissemination of news and information in the public interest, and the promotion of professional and ethical standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not believe that it would be appropriate to establish a body with such a remit. Our attitude to press self-regulation should by now be well known to hon. Members. I set it out at length in the statement that I made to the House on 14 January, giving the Government's initial response to Sir David Calcutt's report, "Review of Press Self-Regulation". I said then that, although the Government accepted Sir David's overall conclusion that the Press Complaints Commission, as currently constituted, was not an effective regulator of the press, we had yet to be persuaded that a statutory complaints tribunal on the lines that he had recommended was necessary or would be appropriate, and that we would be extremely reluctant to go down that route. That remains our view, but let me make it clear that our minds are not closed on this issue. That is why I set out our timetable on 14 January. We have not ruled out the possibility of statutory regulation, nor have we yet ruled out the possibility of a strengthened form of press self-regulation. We shall listen to the debates in this Committee with great interest because they form part of the timetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also look forward to receiving the report by the National Heritage Select Committee on privacy and media intrusion, and to hearing the final views of the press and the Press Complaints Commission on the reforms that they intend to introduce in response to the 12 specific criticisms Sir David Calcutt made of the PCC in his review. For my part, I hope that genuine and far-reaching reforms can be introduced in current self-regulation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State believes that the PPC may change itself, but will he consider the cases that I have described today when he raises that issue with people? They are all recent cases, so the PCC presumably thinks them permissible. I am worried that unless we address the matter, such cases will continue. I ask him to ensure that any proposals that he makes cover such cases, unless he thinks the way in which they have been reported was acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comment. As I said, we shall be observing what changes the PCC introduces. I recognise that tests will need to be applied to them. The hon. Gentleman has done the Committee a service by mentioning specific cases that can be used as such tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The independent press authority proposed by the Bill conforms neither to the present PCC nor to the model proposed by Sir David Calcutt. It was in that sense that the hon. Gentleman referred to it as a middle way. It puts the emphasis on accuracy of presentation, with what I hope that he will forgive me if I call a vague remit to promote press freedom and professional and ethical standards. The Government certainly acknowledge that freedom of expression is fundamental in a democratic society—I think that that was made clear on 14 January—as is accurate presentation of news.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the hon. Member for Hammersmith. Whether it is not the balance between press freedom on the one hand and professional and ethical standards on the other—particularly the respect for the right to privacy—which is crucial? That was certainly Sir David's view in his report. Such trailers as I have read of the Select Committee's report suggest that that may also be its view. It is also the Government's view. We believe it unsatisfactory to establish a statutory body with the sort of unbalanced remit that the hon. Member for Hammersmith proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the Bill proposes that the authority should have responsibility for promoting high standards of journalism, it does not—except in relation to matters of accuracy—explain how such standards are to be attained. The Committee will recall that, in the era of modern journalism, high standards were set at the beginning of the 18th century by Defoe, Steele and Addison. The fact that the introduction of modern journalism occurred during a period of moderate Toryism I regard as wholly co-incidental, but I draw it to the Committee's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a statutory body were to be introduced, it would need to be somewhat different, with wider functions and powers, from that which the hon. Member for Hammersmith proposes. He used the example of the Independent Television Commission and suggested that that represented a middle way. I have already said that, because of the narrow focus of the authority that he proposes, I do not think that it would constitute the middle way that he wants. The difference between the electronic media and the press, and the reason why the electronic media have that independent authority, is that there has been a long-standing tradition of regulation in broadcasting, initially because of spectrum scarcity. There has been no such tradition in the press. The hon. Gentleman would thus be breaking entirely new ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure that the Secretary of State said what he meant to when he said that it was only for reasons of spectrum scarcity—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that it was initially because of spectrum scarcity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has nothing to do with the obligations concerning fairness, balance and impartiality, for example, that are laid upon broadcasters. I do not argue with the Secretary of State about spectrum scarcity, but I do not think that it was the trigger for placing those obligations upon commercial and BBC channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Brooke</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was trying to make—the hon. Gentleman is quite right to pick me up on what I said—was that the tradition of a statutory authority derived in the first instance from spectrum scarcity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to what I said earlier. If we were to cross the Rubicon—as the hon. Member for Hammersmith has invited us to do—by having a statutory authority, it should be significantly different from that which he proposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) said on Second Reading that the Government do not believe that the Bill is the way forward, especially at this time. The Government do not want the Bill, unamended on the statute book. That places me in delicate position in a clause stand part debate. We said that we wish to listen to the debate on the Bill and it is better to allow it to take its course without distorting it by altering particular clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to return to a case which my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith raised—that of the Taylor sisters. I wish to do so because the family is from the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) and we have spoken with them. I know that my hon. Friend has worked closely with them in preparing for the forthcoming appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise a point about the accuracy of the press reporting during the trial, not just because such an inaccuracy affects the individuals involved but because the matter goes to the heart of our criminal justice system. If the press cannot get it right in such situations, that undermines the whole judicial process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents of Lisa and Michelle Taylor wrote to us describing their concerns about what happened. They asked about press reporting. In their letter they say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would like to see a restriction on the press reporting of cases such as this. The reporting of the first day of our daughters' trial was sensational and misleading. As your will know, a trial opens with a summary of the prosecutions' case. Although the press report this as 'An Old Bailey jury heard that …" the impression created is that this is what actually happened not what the prosecution are claiming happened. The effect of this reporting was to suggest at the beginning of the trial that our daughters were guilty of the crime of which they were accused."</p></blockquote>
They go on to say that they understand that juries are instructed not to read the newspapers, but as they point out, jury members have families like everyone else, they watch television and it is difficult for them not to be aware of what is reported in the press. They finish their letter by saying,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would suggest that justice would be better served by restricting reporting in certain cases until after the verdict."</p></blockquote>
I understand the Secretary of State's view that that restriction would go too far and that it cannot happen, but an independent authority would ensure that the press did not make such allegations. For example, the tabloids generally, and one or two in particular, used details of the prosecution's case to concoct a lethal mixture of teenage love, infidelity and jealousy. They did that without giving anything like the same space to the case for the defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, were obviously very distraught about what was happening to their daughters and felt extremely strongly about it. Even if they, as relatives, were able to complain about the distortions in the press it is extremely difficult to envisage them feeling able to make such complaints during the trial. Their main concern was to support their daughters. An opportunity must exist for others to say, "This must stop". An independent authority must be able to step in and say, "We cannot have that type of reporting."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The press reported the diary of one of the accused girls on the basis that it was a strong part of the prosecution's evidence. More than a year before the murder took place, she wrote that she had strong feelings of dislike for her lover's wife. Subsequently, she wrote that she got on well with her, that they had met and were quite friendly. None of that was reported in the press. 	<i>The Sun</i> did a mock up of a diary page using the girl's initial entry, describing her wish that the wife were not on the scene, which would have given her more chance of being with her lover. There was no attempt to put the other side of the story that, later, their relationship had developed positvely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not discuss the details of the case. They will be dealt with during the appeal, but we are worried about the use of pictures at the time of the wedding and the phraseology that was employed. The tabloids constantly used the description "a jealous mistress" without stating that that was only an allegation. The words
	<br><blockquote><p>"Wife's killer took husband home to find stabbed body"</p></blockquote>
were used, again without it being made clear that that that it was an allegation. No quotation marks were used by 	<i>Today</i> in July when it reported the story. The way in which the press built up and sensationalised events must have helped the prosecution's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pictures of the wedding that were not used by the prosecution were printed. They were obtained by other means. The pictures were stills taken from a video. They were accurate in the sense that they were pictures of what took place, but they could have given a distorted impression because they were stills from a moving picture. The PCC made no attempt to do anything about the misuse of the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Secretary of State say how the PCC could assume a more pro-active role? More stringent guidelines, must be introduced, particularly for cases with a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0301">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
mixture of detail that could provide sensational headlines for the tabloids, on how the press can report criminal cases. It is not only Lisa and Michelle Taylor and their guilt or innocence that is affected. Everything that we are trying to do to secure a fair, proper and open justice system is undermined. I ask the Secretary of State to examine carefully what my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith has included in the Bill to obtain accurate and fair accounts of all cases, particularly ones such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not have the chance to speak on Second Reading, so I shall congratulate the hon. Member for Hammersmith now on the way that he introduced the Bill. I voted against it and may be the only member of the Committee who did so. I am not an expert on media affairs nor am I a member of the committees to which my right hon. Friend referred. I thank the hon. Gentleman for sending me the report of his special committee and congratulate him on the way in which he ran it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that there are abuses of press freedom. I differ from the hon. Gentleman in that he seems to think that everything is fine with the control of television and that the problems occur only with the control of the press. I do not think that everything is fine with television. I do not have confidence in its ability to investigate fully. We need to be as much concerned about what does not appear in the press and the other media as about what does appear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Maxwell scandal resulted from insufficient investigation. The hon. Gentleman said then the libel laws were a gift to Maxwell but I do not accept that because what Members of Parliament say is protected by privilege. If we are convinced that a matter should be brought into the public domain we have the ability to discuss it in the House without fear of the libel laws.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not approached by anybody in the electronic media or any other medium to say anything about Maxwell that they were afraid to mention because they would have been subject to the libel laws. I question why no Member of Parliament was approached. I believe that there was one narrow reference to Maxwell in relation to the Mossad affair but nothing was said about the scandal of the pension fund. I have no doubt that it would have been exposed as time marched on if matters had not developed in the way that they did, but I believe that any allegation would have been more likely to have appeared in the press than in other media.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My instinct against the Bill is that it would lead to the freedom of the press being muzzled. I would be unhappy if that happened because the press are fundamental to our democracy. I do not consider that the same freedom exists in the electronic media. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, there is a tradition of regulation in the electronic media because of the spectrum scarcity. That is not an expression that I have heard before but it sums up the position exactly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
In the press, there is no scarcity but a multiplicity of newspapers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that if we try to control the press, an underground one will develop. The underground press in Russia was known as samizdat. We witnessed something similar with the Camillagate tapes when fax machines whirred out copies of articles that had appeared in Australian magazines. They were circulated in an underground manner and copies were lying about in the Tea Room of the House of Commons. I would be unhappy if an underground press developed because the independent press authority proposed by the hon. Member for Hammersmith had muzzled our newspapers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the concern expressed by the hon. Gentleman, but a central point of my Bill is that there should be no pre-publication censorship. That marks the crucial difference between my approach and that adopted by Sir David Calcutt and many others. The Bill proposes an adjudication procedure and the legal right to have inaccuracies corrected, otherwise, people may publish what they want. The code will be constructed by the new IPA in consultation with the press, which will have an important status. The hon. Gentleman should note that the code will not be enforced through the courts because that would lead to the loss of press freedom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's argument fully as he seems to be going round in a circle in trying to have his cake and eat it. If the new IPA is to work, it will do so by preventing articles from being printed, otherwise, standards will remain as they are. I do not see that it would have any effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely, the point is that by establishing that authority and having an oversight of the accuracy of reporting, journalists will be more likely—that is the hope—to adhere to a standard of accuracy. Many years ago, they adhered to that standard by virtue of their professional approach but that declined long since and the new standard has become acceptable to their editors and a large section of the newspaper reading public. By creating a body that will raise journalists' sights, they will meet the standards of their own code. At present, the code has no teeth and no sanction attaches to it, so journalists no longer follow it. The proposal is an attempt to educate journalists and create an atmosphere in which they will put their own house in order. It should not have to be imposed on them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That was an extremely long intervention. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East has forgotten what he was saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had forgotten that my hon. Friend was speaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As far as I could follow the drift of my hon. Friend's remarks, he seemed to be supporting what I was saying, by arguing that the independent press authority would deter newspapers from printing what they would otherwise have printed. That goes to the heart of the issue. I feel instinctively that we should place more trust in people when they decide which newspaper to buy. They are not compelled to buy a particular newspaper; they make a choice. In choosing to buy a newspaper, they are, in essence, supporting the editorial judgments that lie behind what is printed in that paper. The hon. Gentleman wants to impose a statutory body which would be appointed by democratically elected people to stop people buying the paper that they choose. If they did not like the way in which the paper was produced editorially, they would not buy it and the paper would have no circulation. We certainly want high standards, however.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Glenda Jackson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hampstead and Highgate)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an edition of "Any Questions?"—which, as the Committee knows, is a live radio programme—the audience was asked whether they would buy the Sunday newspapers that carried the first episodes of Diana's true story. We were told by the moderator of the programme that the audience voted against the idea of such a story being printed and indicated that they would not buy those newspapers. One of the newspapers sent to the small village in question a reporter, who discovered that all the Sunday papers sold out within half an hour of the shops opening. One must accept that what we say we want and what, in fact, we want do not always coincide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point. In the light of that paradox, we should leave it to individuals to exercise their own judgment. They may say that they will not do something, and then go away and do it. Why should we interfere with the freedom to make that decision? If people do not want to buy a newspaper, they will not buy it. Its circulation will decline and it will go out of existence, or a new editorial policy will be introduced to restore circulation figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What then does the hon. Gentleman say about the witness in the Jamie Bulger case, or the Taylor case? In one case members of a family who have done no wrong in law have been hounded, and in the other there may well have been a wrongful conviction. Is that part of this freedom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Control must be exercised by a statutory body imposed by the Government or by a consensus view among the press, which is how the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Press Complaints Commission is supposed to operate. We all recognise that there are weaknesses in the PCC, and we want it to operate more effectively by agreeing higher standards and adhering to them. A consensus should be established. There are standards for journalists. They belong to the Chartered Institute of Journalists, which has its own professional standards. Journalists should be able to exercise discipline among themselves. If weaknesses are sufficiently exposed, the public should be allowed to make a judgment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the heart of the matter. The hon. Gentleman's point touches on that of his hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth. The issue was made clear in Baroness Hollis's evidence. The new Press Complaints Commission and the editors at the time wanted to put an end to the Press Commission because the editors did not like its code. In other words, the editors got rid of the code. It is not that they could not follow the code—they could, but it interfered with the circulation war. Newspapers editors want to be able to produce the sort of stories to which I have referred this morning because they push up circulation, not because of press freedom. A democratic body such as the House of Commons must decide where the balance between freedom and responsibility lies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that an ossified code is the answer. There will be developments, and people will not want to be restricted in future by regulations that were agreed in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that what does not appear in the press concerns me as much as what does. There are abuses, and we want to improve standards. But I am still worried that matters which should get reported do not get reported. The Maxwell scandal was a massive omission, and many people suffered because of it. The hon. Member for Hammersmith has, quite rightly, mentioned cases of people who have suffered because of abuses of press freedom, but we must accept that there will be some instances of abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand how an independent press authority could control abuses in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. There would still be instances of contrived photographs of the sort involved in the tragedy surrounding Sir Allan Green and his late wife. I do not think that we can eliminate such abuses. If we do, however, we will also eliminate coverage of even more stories which should be properly investigated. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, it is a question of striking a balance between editorial balance and the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am unhappy with the idea of one law for the press and another for individuals. The libel laws apply to everyone; there is no separate law for the press. There is a danger that in trying to control abuses the Bill will clamp down on the press and treat it differently from individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something should be done about the libel laws and the damages that can be won in libel cases—there are anomalies in the system. However, too much is made
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
of the libel laws. I mentioned earlier the freedom of Members of Parliament to comment on various issues. If the press is afraid of printing something, it can approach a Member of Parliament and, if it can convince him of the truth of a case, ask him to raise the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeff Rooker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Perry Barr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On about five occasions, the hon. Gentleman has virtually given those outside the House an open invitation to deliver the brown envelope to him. He has just said that if the press can convince a Member of Parliament that its story is accurate, he can raise it in the House. If the press can do that, it can publish the story and put up a fair defence. It would have no need to ask a Member of Parliament to use privilege. The hon. Gentleman's argument against the Bill has not a shred of validity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred several times to Maxwell. I know of no one in this place who was ever approached or heard hints about Maxwell. The only information was the injunction against the Bowyer books. Three books were published and one was attacked. At no time, as far as I know, did the author seek to have the matter raised in this place. I think that the hon. Gentleman raised the point as a red herring.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to differ. I spoke in the House on one occasion and I took advice from the Speaker and the Speaker's legal officer on what I could and could not say, because the person to whom I referred was well known for his litigious attitude. On that occasion I was satisfied that what I said was absolutely right and that I was not abusing the privileges of the House by saying it. However, I was advised that I should not repeat it outside the House without being aware that action could then be taken. Had I or any other hon. Member known any of the background facts that emerged later about the Maxwell pension scandal, we would have been in dereliction of our duties had we kept silent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not invite all and sundry to approach me and ask if I will raise this, that or the other subject; but if something important came to my attention, and if I was satisfied about its truth, I should want to speak about it. It has often been said that people could not expose Maxwell because of their fear of his taking libel action against them. He was well known for the writs that he issued to stop people saying things about him. No doubt a trail of factors might have led to an earlier exposure, had it been possible. I therefore do not accept what the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand exactly what the hon. Gentleman has said, but he must not be too hard on himself or other hon. Members. None of Maxwell's fellow directors in Mirror Group Newspapers knew what villainy was going on. How were we supposed to know?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to recall the 	<i>Financial Times</i> published articles that pointed to the fact that all might
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
not be as rosy in the Maxwell empire as we thought. I do not recall anything being said then about things that might have affected the pension funds. No doubt, one factor that led to Maxwell's death was that had more time been allowed, more information might have emerged and more might have been said in the House, as it would not have been printed. There is no doubt that Maxwell's ability to throw writs about inhibited the free investigation that should have been undertaken. I raise the Maxwell issue because we must be just as careful about limiting the freedom of the press as in deciding how to encourage the press to be more responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not happy about setting up a statutory, independent press authority. I would prefer to consider ways in which the Press Complaints Commission could be made much stronger; otherwise, I fear a loss of the freedoms that we now enjoy and the appearance of an underground press—the worst of all worlds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for the length of my earlier intervention, Mr. Hogg, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham). We are dealing with a complex issue, with nuances about accuracy and what can or cannot be printed. My hon. Friend talked about his having less confidence in the electronic media than does the hon. Member for Hammersmith . We are not dealing with electronic media, so we cannot pursue that argument. However I share my hon. Friend's lack of confidence. I have no more faith in the accuracy of the BBC or ITV than I have in 	<i>The Sun</i> or the 	<i>Daily Mirror.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Give us an example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to give way if the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) wish to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has obviously thought deeply about the matter. Having made such a statement, perhaps he would give us a list of instances when the BBC or ITV has infringed a code of accuracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure, Mr. Hogg, that you would rule me out of order if I did. We are dealing with the establishment of an independent press authority. I merely observe that concerns about whether the electronic media are totally accurate and have generally a much higher standard that the press, or whether the reverse is true, are not relevant to the question of whether we should have an independent press authority and the nature of its powers. I am entitled to have a lack of faith in something without necessarily being able to identify every area of inaccuracy that would add to that lack of faith. The fact remains that I do not have any great faith in the accuracy of any of the media.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, I can help the hon. Gentleman by referring to a survey carried out by Glasgow university, which I shall make available to members of the Committee should they so wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
The survey found that people gave 6.3 marks out of 10 to television and the quality newspapers as an assessment of their good reputation for protecting citizens' rights and liberties. They gave 4.4 marks out of 10 to the tabloid newspapers and, as one might expect, 	<i>The Sun</i> came bottom of the list with only 3.3 marks. The survey shows that the public's perceptions are not the same as those of the hon. Gentleman. People have much more respect for what they see and hear on television than for what they read in the newspapers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how far down that route I should go. The hon. Gentleman referred to identifying the press or television as protectors of citizens' rights. That is not my point. I am talking about accuracy. I do not quibble with the view that the press and television may be seen as protecting people and their rights. I have no quarrel with that, but it does not mean that they are always accurate and that I should have faith in their accuracy. The opinion poll about the public's perception of the ability of various sections of the media to uphold their rights and to call into question what the establishment is doing is a different issue from whether the media is accurate. That is all I say about the electronic media, although I could perhaps promote a Bill to look after them at a later date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith made his case for setting up the independent press authority. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will continue to consider the issue of a statutory body and not rely on the body that already exists. However, some points made by the hon. Members for Hammersmith and for Lewisham, East (Mrs. Prentice) worried me by focusing on cases in which the accuracy of what was said was questioned even though the press reported accurately what was stated in court. Their argument appeared to relate to how much information should be reported at any stage in a court hearing, not to whether the press should be able to report it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone is described as a jealous mistress and, subsequently, turns out to be one, I do not see how one can complain about accuracy. It is an epithet that one either does or does not accept. I understand why the hon. Member for Lewisham made her argument and I am as concerned as she is about the issues that arise from that sort of reporting. However, I do not see how an independent press authority can deal more effectively than any other body that we could set up with cases in which a court is confronted by submissions that the press report accurately. It would not be right for the authority to deal with such cases, and the hon. Members for Hammersmith and for Lewisham, East did not question the accuracy of the reporting. I do not see how the independent press authority could control such cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Bridget Prentice</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I was making was that the reporting was carried out in such a way that statements were printed as fact rather than as allegations. In a trial they are allegations until such time as they are found to be fact. That was the problem with the case that I described. There was no attempt to put words in quotation marks or to say "allegedly".
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
That would have given a fairer and more balanced view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If memory serves me right, the hon. Lady mentioned the fact that the report used words such as "the court was told" or "the court heard". The hon. Member for Hammersmith made that point, but he suggested that such references were not significant and that the tenor of the report was that it described what had actually happened. I do not think that an independent press authority could deal with such an issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roger Knapman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stroud)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the hon. Member for Hammersmith was in essence complaining about the size of the type used in the headlines and not a lot more?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was addressing a matter of public concern. It is a legitimate issue. I am worried about how the accuracy of a newspaper report on what was said in court during a day of a hearing would be assessed. I am also worried about the extent to which power to adjudicate should be given to an independent press authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. I understand his worry. I used the example of the Jamie Bulger case. There were straight inaccuracies. Headlines wrongly stated that a boy had been held for his murder. In the example that I used from the Taylor sisters case, which was different from that used by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East who drew on other newspapers, 	<i>The Sun</i> was technically accurate. My point was that a pro-active independent body ought to be prepared to make ex cathedra statements about the method of reporting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adjudications could not be made by saying, "This bit is right, that bit is wrong." Everything in the report was technically correct, but there is a strong case for a body, which is held in esteem by the public, being able to state that reporting is being done in such a way that it prejudices a fair trial. That would not involve a newspaper going to court or being fined, but put in the news domain the fact that the way that reporting was being carried out could prejudice the outcome of a case. Bearing in mind what the Taylor sisters' solicitor wrote in his letter to me about jury members reading the papers, that is profoundly important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not an expert in these matters, but I would have thought that the courts have the power to hold a newspaper in contempt if it published statements in the course of a hearing that were inaccurate and could influence the outcome. I am not qualified to judge such legal points, but I do not think that newspaper reporting of the prosecution and defence cases on different days is an issue on which an independent press authority could adjudicate effectively. If Lord McGregor's equivalent became the chairman of such an independent authority, I do not know whether him commenting from the steps of his office in central London about the reporting of a court case that day by 	<i>The Sun,</i> the 	<i>Daily Mirror</i> or 	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> would affect the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
We are being asked to create a body, give it a legal definition, define its powers and decide how it would carry out its duties. We need to draw the terms of reference tightly in the expectation that they will be used. There is no earthly point in creating a body with vague jurisdiction that is not understood. Such a body would be reduced to making statements on the street that it is not happy with the reporting of a court case on a particular day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hammersmith knows that my sympathies are with him, but to achieve his objectives the narrow definition of the accuracy of a report has to be tackled. I do not share the anxieties of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East about what is not put in newspapers. When I intervened on his speech, I accepted that years ago there was inaccuracy. There has always been inaccuracy in newspapers, but there is now a perception that there is a lower standard of accuracy in certain sections of the press. I should say the same about today's BBC, compared with that established under Lord Reith. He was employed by the BBC: he did not privately contract his services to it. That is another example of the decline in standards in the broadcasting media as well as in print.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seek to share such issues with the Committee because on Report we shall need answers to all these problems. As a significant time was spent discussing court reporting—and I understand why—we must get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how one could control practices such as photographing the prostitute who had been put up to accost the late Lady Green. I can understand that an ex-cathedra statement would be made, but how much effect that would have on Kelvin MacKenzie is open to question. If we are to establish, as I think we should, an independent press authority, we should ensure that its terms of reference are narrowly drawn and effectively enforceable. Otherwise it will be viewed with the same disrespect and treated with the same contempt that most of the journalistic profession accords to the present press complaints body.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Glenda Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the dissatisfaction and sense of decay expressed by the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth about radio. One reason for the infinitely greater accuracy of radio is that it is a live news medium. It behoves its personnel, therefore, to check and recheck constantly. I mentioned on Second Reading the enormous respect in which the BBC World Service, for example, is held all over the world for the accuracy of its reporting. The press could emulate that. A central element of my hon. Friend's Bill is that accuracy of reporting should be paramount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should listen to radio a great deal, given the time, and the events that I want to describe to the Committee were reported on a programme that I heard two weeks ago. I think that it was "You and Yours", which is regularly broadcast on Radio 4 at 10 past 12 on weekdays. The story related to a man who had been born
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
blind. Either by accident or design someone purporting to be a faith healer had been in contact with him. A promise was made that the man's sight would be restored by his gazing at a photograph of the faith healer and, I believe, either briefly speaking to her on the telephone or concentrating on her name, for a certain length of time. He was asked about the result and said that he had seen three bright flashes, but his sight was as it was before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>The Sun</i> telephoned him and asked whether he had seen light and had his sight been restored. He told the reporter precisely what had happened. 	<i>The Sun</i> ran a story referring to a miracle and saying that the man's sight had been restored. His elderly mother came to hear of it and suffered a minor heart attack from shock. The man went out with the aid of his white stick as he had always done. People who knew him snatched the stick away, accused him of being a charlatan, and claimed that his sight had been restored. The BBC offered 	<i>The Sun</i> air time either to withdraw and apologise or to confirm the story. I understand that the assistant, or deputy editor, on hearing the evidence, refused to apologise or to retract the story.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The essential point about the incident is that not only the central figure but also members of his family suffered from the inaccurate and unfounded story. The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East spoke of libel actions as a form of redress against the worst inaccuracies of newspapers. To bring a libel case involves a great deal of time between the incident and redress and costs a great deal of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of the evidence gathered by my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith shows that people who feel that they have been injured by the inaccuracies of the press do not seek financial redress. In a sense, they want their character and good name restored to them; concomitant with that restoration is the element of time. People want to be able to rebut what has been said about them and for the truth to be told quickly. Even if people could afford the legal process, which I doubt, it would not meet their needs because it takes such a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Lady enlighten the Committee on whether the case of the blind person to which she referred was reported to the PCC? If so, what was its attitude? I understand that 	<i>The Sun</i> is supposed to have its own ombudsman, so can she tell us what his reaction was? Timing can work both ways because the PCC will not accept complaints more than three weeks after the event. I complained to it about a reference to a colleague who did not want to raise the matter himself. By the time that I had checked with him, had had a letter of complaint typed and so on, the three weeks had elapsed and I was told that the PCC would not consider the complaint. Although one wants to react quickly in such cases, the three week limit set by the PCC makes me very unhappy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can check the details of the case and come back to hon. Member for Bolton, North-East with accurate information, but it was because either the ombudsman of 	<i>The Sun</i> or the PCC had failed to act that that individual took his case to the BBC which broadcasts a radio programme for people who feel that they have been maligned or served badly in various circumstances. Clearly, there was a long gap before that individual complained and therefore the opportunity to redress the injury that he and his family had suffered was not taken up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should know that even if the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Jackson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that information. I wish to discuss the photograph to which my hon.

I believe that that photograph had been specifically fabricated for financial gain. It had no connection with the initial resignation of Sir Allan Green and it was published after the tragic suicide of Lady Green. I believe that it would in the brief of the IPA to ensure that if a newspaper had published that photograph, it would publish details to explain how it had received it and how it had been created. That would make it abundantly clear that it bore no relation to any part of the story about which the public had a right to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should say immediately that his reluctance to go down the road towards statutory authority is generally shared in the House and beyond. He will know that.

The pity with the whole debate is that it arises principally because today's breed of newspaper owners and the editors that they hire, have let go of professional standards. I do not pass that judgment on professional journalists. There are many fine journalists working on national newspapers, many of whom are offended by the antics which they are supposed to get up to these days—the antics that are riding on the back of attempts to flog a few extra issues. The core of the matter is that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
responsibility for proper professional standards rests with the owners and the editors—that is where the buck should stop. I do not want people who change their nationality every other day, who then claim to have been born again, and who practise those alleged beliefs on the other side of the Atlantic, to turn a blind eye to what is occurring in publications in this country which they own and control. I strongly believe that an individual responsibility rests primarily with the owners. The owner has a duty, when appointing an editor, to make absolutely clear, what is expected of that person. I know of no responsible working journalist who would jib at any of the obligations to be accurate that my hon. Friend is proposing in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I worked as a journalist if there was uncertainty about an aspect of a particular story that rule was "If in doubt, leave it out"—I can remember one newsroom in which that message was strung up on a poster across the middle of the room. Heavens above, that sounds old-fashioned these days, does it not? We know from the editor of 	<i>The Sun,</i> among others, that the practice has been—we have his promise that this will no longer happen and we accept that—that if one cannot persuade people to say what one wants them to say, so that one has the story that one wants to write, one says the words oneself and puts them into somebody else's mouth. That is obviously totally unacceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot recall having heard a single complaint from journalists working in television or radio about the professional obligations—that is what they are—laid upon them concerning balance, fairness and, more latterly, impartiality. They work under far tighter constraints and controls than anything envisaged in the Bill. At the same time, the Glasgow university poll that I mentioned to the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth shows—it is not the only poll to do so—that members of the public have a marked degree of trust in the news from both commercial and BBC television and radio. It is interesting that in times of national crisis, there is a significant increase in the viewing figures for the BBC news bulletins. I do not say that to knock the ITN news, but the feeling seems to be that if a piece of news is that important, one wants to hear it from and see it on the BBC. That is a mark of the great respect in which the BBC is rightly held. In pursuit of selling a few more newspapers, particularly at the tabloid end of the market, accuracy takes a back seat far too often.

The Bill is not about controlling journalists or trying to interfere with what is published. We can argue about method, but the Bill puts forward the simple proposition that what is published should be accurate. If accuracy cannot be guaranteed, the report should not be published. That proposal is extremely simple. Of course, life is not as black and white as that and some newspapers will undoubtedly take more risks, but that is the bottom line. I do not understand why such a proposal should get people in. Fleet street jumping up and down.

There is general acceptance, which the Secretary of State repeated today, that the Press Complaints Commission has not performed as well as expected. The

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
former Press Council collapsed because it failed in its remit and its was hoped that the PCC would do better. I do not know how we could have expected seven editors and eight of the great and the good—at least three of whom had performed senior and distinguished executive service in the newspaper industry—to perform a miracle of self-regulation. They were far too close to their subject for that. It is easy to understand why some editors were invited to serve on the PCC; they could concentrate their minds and those of their immediate brothers and sisters on neighbouring, and often competing titles. However, I regard that as rather like asking the neighbourhood burglar for security advice. The PCC was never going to work because it was a kept person, funded entirely by the newspaper industry and comprised of people from and around the edges of that industry whose objectivity was, at the very least, open to question. That attempt at self-regulation did not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Great Yarmouth raised a point about owners and editors. Members of the National Union of Journalists—of whom I am one—and of the Chartered Institute of Journalists subscribe codes of conduct which are an attempt to establish professional behaviour. Individual members are expected to uphold those standards, irrespective of how owners and editors may view them. I can recall instantly some famous cases, going back many years, in which attempts were made to discipline or dismiss journalists who refused to do what had been asked of them in the name of their editors on the grounds that it would contravene the NUJ code of conduct. Many famous battles were fought in Fleet street. I cannot recall one such case occurring more recently than 20 years ago: I know that times have changed. Although such codes of behaviour are important to the integrity of the individual journalist, they cannot assist us if they are not respected by newspaper owners and editors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill has offered us a possible way forward. I come now to the nub of the issue. Do we go for an independent press authority by way of the statutory route and try to achieve—as the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith would—its establishment at arm's length? Clause 2 sets out a list of duties and responsibilities that the authority itself will draw up. They will not be dictated by the Government. Alternatively, do we again tell the national newspapers—no doubt, to muffled laughter—that we jumped up and became terribly cross, as a result of which, we say, "You've got one last chance"? If we do that, we shall end up looking like prize turnips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Newspapers have been banking on such an outcome. They know that many people get steamed up about such matters and breathe fire and brimstone. I understand the complexities and the sensitivities of the issue, but the newspapers believe that, in the end, we will back down. The Secretary of State might be persuaded that his paws will not be on the Bill if it is enacted. It is a private Member's Bill on which the Government take a view. It is a unique vehicle that belongs to the hon. Member who is promoting it and his supporters. It is subject to the decision of the House. It is not Government-driven.

The Bill is the best thing on offer so far. The independent press authority would be the best of any alternatives that the industry is likely to face. Discussions are taking place between the PCC and others to change certain policies, tickle them up and so on, but that will not be good enough. My hon. Friend has offered us a way forward that would put things on a statutory basis. The authority would not be a creature of Government. There are other examples of that in the media sector—the Independent Television Commission for one. I firmly believe that clause 1 merits being part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

That is why it stands firmly on two feet. One is press freedom, and the other is responsibility. I believe that freedom and responsibility go together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal first with amendment No. 6. Hon. Members will know that when one wins the ballot to bring in a private Member's Bill, one is required to draw up a long title fairly quickly. I did so, drawing the words from the Government's Broadcasting Bill of 1990, which used the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"with due accuracy and impartiality".</p></blockquote>
It has since been suggested to me by several journalists and others that the inclusion of the word "impartiality" poses a risk to press and broadcasting freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the best illustrations of this was an ITV journalist describing Hitler's occupation of the Rhine-land in impartial terms. It was enough to make one's hair stand on end. I am therefore happy to drop the word "impartiality", as it would lead to difficulties in the broadcasting world, which is not what I seek to achieve. I take the view that in the world of the press, with which my Bill deals, one can be partial, but one must be accurate. No one objects to partiality, as long as it is done accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East expressed fear at the prospect of press regulation. Let me say as loudly and clearly as I can what I have said on numerous occasions: the argument is not over whether we regulate the press. In my view the press is already massively over-regulated in Britain. We have dramatically increased regulation over the past 10 to 20 years. That is not a good approach. The question is not whether there should be regulation—there is regulation in all countries—but what sort of regulation there should be, and how it should be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members who were in the House in 1987 will recall that I won the ballot on the motions for debate on a Friday. In the debate on the press which took place on 24 November 1987, I devoted my remarks largely to the way in which press freedom has been eroded in Britain over the years. One of the battles that I had with editors in the past few months has been on the issue of press freedom. Editors ignored the threats to press freedom that arose from time to time over the past 10 to 20 years. I and others warned them but they ignored those warnings until their journalists appeared in court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Parliament was considering renewing the terms of the prevention of terrorism Act and I was Front-Bench spokesman for the Labour party, I warned that if that legislation was enacted, it would be only a matter of time before a journalist found himself in court. Last year a journalist from Box Productions for Channel 4 appeared in court under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 and was fined, although Box Productions paid the fine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time the press took no notice of the warnings that I and others gave that press freedom was at risk. Over the past 14 years that I have been in Parliament,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
there have been many other examples of the erosion of press freedom and of editors ignoring that risk. They began to take notice when "Spycatcher" appeared in their sights. Suddenly they discovered that they had lost many of the freedoms that they had taken for granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said in my opening remarks that although the press was over-regulated, it was regulated in the wrong way. Since my decision to introduce the Bill, I have made it clear that I would like to put into British law a general defence of press freedom. Because of our unwritten constitution, we tend to say all the things that we are not allowed to do. That means that the Government—of whatever party—are in a similar position. They can do whatever they like as long as it is not against the law. That can result in a loss of press freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad but true that in the past few years the International Press Institute has had reason to raise the question of the British press and say that Britain, the home of the free press, has lost a number of freedoms in recent years—enough to cause concern. I think that I have the agreement of the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East in saying that there have been serious erosions of press freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we have controlled the press in the wrong way. There are regulations which apply specifically to journalists and they operate in two ways. Some regulations are to the advantage of the press. They date from the 19th century when the press was given special rights to report, for example, Select Committees in the House of Commons. The press was given a privileged right in libel cases if it was prepared to present the alternative case and print a statement made by the person being libelled. So the press has a certain restricted privilege in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The press has other privileges vis-à-vis courts and local authorities that do not apply to the general public. The press is protected by certain laws on certain aspects. That is right. However, many laws have been passed and practices adopted which have restricted press freedom. The Lobby system and the D notice system are examples of practices which do not help press freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also measures which relate specifically to the press and which restrict reporting freedom. They include the Defamation Act 1952, the Obscene Publications Act 1959, the Contempt of Court Act 1981 and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Incidentally, I warned the press about the 1984 Act. To their credit, two national newspapers and one local Bristol paper took up the matter strongly because they were affected by the legislation. Virtually no attention was paid to the new power that it gave the police to seize journalistic material. That was a great step backwards for press freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, the list includes the Official Secrets Act 1989, the Criminal Justice Act 1991, the Sexual
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0309">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
Offences (Amendment) Act 1992, prevention of terrorism legislation, the Security Service Act 1989, the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 and the Broadcasting Act 1990. Those are just some examples of legislation that has restricted press freedom in recent years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because it is difficult to include in the Bill a general legal defence of press freedom, I have fallen back on amendment No. 1, which would give the authority a duty to promote press freedom. To the question of whether a body can promote press freedom as well as adjudicating on accuracy and drawing up a code of standards, my answer is yes. A number of people gave evidence in support of that view, but the clearest is probably that given by Baroness Hollis, published in my report of my committee. She powerfully made the point that we needed the authority to be able to strike the crucial balance between press freedom and responsibility. To deal separately with those two issues would be to ignore the fact that a balance between them exists. Much of my Bill relies on the assumption that freedom cannot be had without responsibility. If there is responsibility and no freedom, we shall lose out the other way. There must be a balance between freedom and responsibility and we need an independent body, with higher status than the PCC to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to strengthen the wording of the Bill. Lawyers and others suggested that I should do that. Clause 2(1)(b) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"to investigate and monitor issues relating to freedom of the press and to report to Parliament on any measure it may consider desirable to protect press freedom".</p></blockquote>
That sets out a clear duty on the proposed IPA to report to Parliament on the press. Amendment No. 1 would add the much stronger words "and to promote", which argues the case for press freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Secretary of State is considering how to legislate, I put it to him that we are in danger of considering passing a privacy Bill without a counterbalancing press freedom or freedom of information Act. I do not know of one western country but I am not suggesting that one does not exist, that has a privacy Act without counterbalancing freedom of information legislation. The Secretary of State may well say that we can deal with that by the sort of let-out clauses that often appear in British Bills. For example, a Bill may state, "you can invade privacy if it is in the public interest to do so."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to consider that issue, because I fear that otherwise the Government will go down the wrong road. On pages xii and xiii of the conclusion to his latest report, Sir David Calcutt proposes a new criminal offence of physical intrusion. Hon. Members have suggested—as did the Secretary of State earlier today—that the concern felt relates to invasion of privacy. That is not supported by the evidence of complaints to the PCC. More importantly, only a few cases have aroused sufficient public interest to impel hon. Members to become involved. Two of those are well known—that of the right hon. and learned Member for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
Putney (Mr. Mellor) when he was the Secretary of State for National Heritage and that of the royal family. The new criminal offence of physical intrusion proposed by Sir David Calcutt would not have prevented either of those cases from occurring. The section of the summary of the report entitled "Physical intrusion" refers to a surveillance device and to
	<br><blockquote><p>"taking a photograph, or recording the voice".</p></blockquote>
That represents an attempt to prevent actions such as the tapping of a telephone in the flat where the right hon. and learned Member for Putney was staying. I agree that that was wrong. It should not have been done, and if the Government propose a law against such actions I shall have no problem voting for it. At the top of page xiii, the report says that such actions would be allowed if they were
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of preventing the public from being misled by some public statement or action of the individual concerned".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend made a slip of the tongue. The Calcutt report does not say that people should be allowed to do that, but that a defence of preventing the public from being misled could be used in any action.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to check me on that point: it would be a defence that would be respected by a court. That would have allowed a defence of the photography of the Duchess of York and the actions in the cases of the right hon. and learned Member for Putney and the Camillagate tapes. It is true that some ordinary people, with whom my Bill is particularly concerned, would be protected, because a public interest defence could not be put in their case. We then get into the difficult water about which the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East is rightly anxious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraphs 7.5 and 7.6 on pages 51 and 52 of the Calcutt report make it clear that the offender in such cases is the journalist. Paragraph 7.6 considers whether it would be possible to deal with the editor—the person who decides to publish the material—as well as the person who collects it. The paragraph states that the privacy committee
	<br><blockquote><p>"considered this point … but concluded that the case had yet to be made for an additional offence of publication. Further, any editor or proprietor could, if circumstances warranted it, be charged as an accessory or with conspiracy."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members who know anything about the law will realise that conspiracy is a very serious offence. To suggest that we use that charge against editors would be a further erosion of press freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If something is published overseas, as in the case of the Camillagate tapes, the problem is that we cannot stop it being published in this country unless we rerun the problems connected with the "Spycatcher" case. If legislation is introduced of the type that Sir David Calcutt recommends, we shall let out of the trap some of the cases about which some people are greatly concerned. However, I have always argued that there was a case for the reports on the royal family and on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0310">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
previous Secretary of State for National Heritage, the right hon. and learned Member for Putney to be published. The way that those cases were reported was questionable, but there was a case for reporting them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we cannot deal with the problem by using the law in that way, why are the Government considering legislation that would have the effect of restricting press freedom without placing on the statute book a counterbalancing press freedom or freedom of information Act? That is the danger. In a private Member's Bill of this type, I cannot legislate to provide a general defence of press freedom, but I should be delighted if the Secretary of State were to intervene to say that he would table an amendment to provide one. The amendment could be based on article 10 of the European convention on human rights, which was drafted by the British. We could also include article 8 of that convention, the privacy clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the possibility of introducing such provisions, we must fall back on the wording of my amendment, which would give the IPA the duty to promote press freedom. I cannot stress too much the importance of that, because, at times, when I warned of the dangers to press freedom, I felt that mine was a lonely voice. I received no support from the press and relatively little support from hon. Members, but I knew that our press freedom was being lost. An authority must be set up to speak effectively for press freedom. If there is no law that offers a general defence of press freedom or a freedom of information Act, the least we need is the provision which will be added to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman make it clear how he proposes that the restriction on press intrusion should operate? I feel, as he does, that we should not tolerate journalists intruding on to private property or bugging private conversations. If a story is in the public interest and it is published abroad, how should we deal with it? It is all very well to say that that will be left to the IPA, but I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman is proposing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are three legs to the stool. We could introduce a privacy law that is counterbalanced by a freedom of information Act or a press freedom law. They constitute two of the legs. The third leg is to create a body that draws up a code independently of, but in consultation with, the press and the media. That code may then be respected and adhered to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there has been debate about whether my approach will deliver what we want, but the alternative is to try to legislate—and in my judgment fail—to cover the cases that people are worried about. At the same time, such legislation would restrict press freedom. The only way in which to persuade editors not to publish something that, for example, appeared overseas about an individual living in Britain is by making them adhere to a code that would respect the individual's privacy. That cannot be enforced by law. Under the Bill, the IPA would draw up a code, but it would not be enforced by law. That would intrude on press freedom. We discussed that difficult subject earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The body would have to have high status. We must not forget that the IPA would be given a specific duty to report to Parliament. If that was found not to work or if further legislation was needed, there would be a route for drawing such things to Parliament's attention. The case for proceeding in such a manner rather than for a self-regulatory body is strong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman make his view about the Camillagate tapes clear? Two national newspapers published the transcript of them; the others did not. What would have happened if the IPA had existed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no doubt that in the cases from which I have given examples—those of the Duchess of York, the so-called Camillagate tapes and the right hon. and learned Member for Putney—there was a public interest defence. Double standards or unsustainable statements were made by people in high public office. The state of the royal marriage is relevant because of the constitution. It cannot be ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What should be published to show that there is a problem? The royal marriage is the classic example. There is a case for publishing that the marriage is in trouble or coming to an end, that there are double standards or that messages from the palace differ from what is really happening. That is all fair game.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is not fair game is using photographs or detailed intimate excerpts of conversations that have been recorded to provide salacious details of a story that is clearly in the public interest. A code that is respected by editors is required. For example, they should report that they know of the existence of a tape that suggests that the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales is virtually at an end, that they are having affairs and that what Buckingham palace is saying about the marriage is untrue. It would be perfectly fair to do such a thing. If necessary, excerpts sufficient to back that up could be released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt, however, that publishing details from the tape of Prince Charles was an unnecessary invasion of his privacy, which was designed to sell newspapers from a sectoral interest angle rather than a public interest one. The same applies to the example of the Duchess of York. It was not necessary to publish all the photographs to make the point that her relationship with her financial adviser was not as it was described by Buckingham palace.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A code is necessary. If the law was used against the press, the public interest clause would allow a defence, otherwise comment would be prevented because the law is so draconian. That would adversely affect press freedom. We need a high-status body that is respected by editors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask members of the Committee to read Baroness Hollis' evidence. It makes the point that editors did not like the old Press Council because it was too pro-active
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1992-1993V007P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>37</span>
whereas the Press Complaints Commission is compliant. I used examples this morning to make the case that the PCC was compliant. It is the dog that does not bark. let alone bite. What is the point of the body that is supposed to protect the public interest being like that? It is nonsensical. We need an independent press authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to repeat the arguments about clause 1—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me if I am pressing the matter. If the Bill became law, would papers such as 	<i>Private Eye</i> be printed abroad and mailed to people here because other Common Market countries' laws differ from the hon. Gentleman's proposals? An underground press might develop because although the laws would apply in this country, there must be free circulation of material in the common market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Soley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is possible to stop stories being published overseas that would be difficult to publish here. The same applies the other way round. 	<i>Paris-Match</i> was fined for publishing pictures of the Duchess of York. What matters is the code, which must be drawn up independently in consultation with and respected by the industry. That will work not perfectly but better than the type of legal restrictions that some people propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I made the point clearly that press freedom is central to the argument and that that is why the Bill is entitled, "Freedom and Responsibility of the Press". The two are and must remain knitted together. We have lost press freedoms in this country. If I cannot go all the way in the general defence of press freedom, the Bill can at least create a body to assist the whistle-blowing process when press freedom is threatened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment, which would remove from the title the words, "and impartiality". We are illogical in our attitudes to television and radio and to newspapers. We happily give television and radio the obligation to be impartial, but by so doing we do not restrict "press freedom". Indeed, many people think that television and radio have more freedom because of that duty to report impartially. Yesterday I met a group of Bulgarian journalists who urged us to expand our World Service transmissions because they felt that their television and radio freedom was enhanced greatly by the World Service's duty to report impartially.

In considering the Bill we face the difficulty of the nature of press freedom. Does media freedom belong to a handful of editors and proprietors or to the people? My hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith has demonstrated how press freedom has been limited by the abuse of taking away someone else's freedom. That may be the freedom to sleep peacefully at night if the press has unfairly taken away a person's good name. Such action diminishes society's freedom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that my hon. Friend wanted to include impartiality as well as accuracy in the Bill because it had worked with television and radio. One day, we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
shall have to face up to news programmes that aim to be partial and to report in the way that newspapers do. As the capacity to transmit increases, we shall be faced with an owner who wants to put out on television fare the equivalent of the 	<i>Daily Express, The Sun,</i> or 	<i>Daily Mail.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that television news companies around the world, such as CNN, seem to have decided to follow World Service standards, rather than taking the tabloid route. Other media operations have copied the example set by the BBC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support my hon. Friend's decision to withdraw the two words, "and impartiality" from the title, because a culture has grown up in which it is thought that newspapers can, and even should, be biased. We often buy newspapers because we know the slant that they will put on the news. We know that we will get one slant with 	<i>The Guardian,</i> another with 	<i>The Times</i> and still another with 	<i>The Sun.</i> I applaud my hon. Friend's decision not to insist upon impartiality of the press, because, given the way the culture in this country defines a newspaper, according it the freedom to be biased, that would be unworkable. But as my hon. Friend has said, it is, I have no doubt, possible to be accurate and impartial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

You have a certain discretion, as the Minister has made it clear that he would like to start afresh, to deem that it is one o'clock. Surely it would be much more convenient for the Committee if the Minister began his speech at the next sitting, rather than delivering his first paragraph today and again when we return.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Carttiss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Hogg. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State expressed a dislike for starting a speech once and having to do so again the next day. Am I to understand that the Committee is meeting tomorrow?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I understand that the Committee will meet next Wednesday. The hon. Gentleman will recall the sittings motion, thought I accept that it seems a long time ago now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett)—I am delighted to see how practised he is in such matters —and I hope it will help him if I content myself with making a wholly factual preliminary remark about amendment No. 1. It would require the independent press authority to report to Parliament on any measure it might consider desirable to protect and promote the freedom of the press, or as it is now more grandly phrased,
	<br><blockquote><p>"the fundamental freedom of the press to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
As I said about clause 1, the Government do not think it appropriate to establish an independent press authority on the lines proposed in the Bill. It follows that we cannot accept the amendment. If 1 o'clock were to strike now, I could resume next Wednesday—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
